People drop the oddest things in forests.</p>\n<p>In your game, you can break up the monotony of forest terrain travel with some of these items.

Most frequently this is during war, where neither the unhelpful morality of good and evil nor the confusion and disorder of chaos allow for clear decisions to be made and victory achieved. The Axiomatic General appears wherever clear-thinking, considered tactics, and balanced plans are being prepared or followed. While the field of war is the usual site for these activities, the Axiomatic General has been known to appear during complicated but emotionless court cases, and sometimes even when the cold, detached clarity of true monkish enlightenment is reached.</p>\n<p>The Axiomatic General is neither male nor female, instead being a creature devoid of physically distracting bias. It can appear as a female or male of any humanoid species, whichever form is most likely to aid with clarity of decision making.</p>\n<h2>Dogma</h2>\n<p>The Axiomatic General and its followers wish to bring the clarity of law to those places that currently live in emotional turmoil and to demonstrate to all the axiomatic nature of law when applied to war, legal frameworks, and personal actions. It expects its believers to instigate and adhere to meaningful laws while at the same time exposing and amending those which are ludicrous, outlandish, convoluted, unenforceable, or contrary. The Overseer of War abhors any decision or process that allows an individual to take unfair advantage of another, either through methods such as emotional blackmail, the abuse of personal power, or as a result of chance. It encourages its followers to engage in long-term ordered “wars” rather than short-and-sharp fights—the chaos of battle is well known, but by carefully considering one’s options, testing one’s theories, and then following through with a well-conceived plan, one can make their way to victory in an ordered manner. If all around them are clear about their intentions, one can see their actions are as fair and just as possible, and that trade and public prosperity, the courts, and the growth of society as a whole can continue during even the greatest of conflicts.</p>\n<p>The Lord of All Wars promotes careful consideration in all matters and expects its followers to be able to provide self-evident truths for all their actions. Haste, guesswork, and self-indulgence lead to reliance on emotion and base, uncontrolled actions. It disapproves of reliance on government or any religious institution that fosters blind trust or, even worse, unprovable belief, explaining that those with sound judgement, mental discipline, and an unshakeable grasp of sensible, irrefutable laws can overcome the inauthentic evidence and invalid arguments of the emotional and chaotic masses.</p>\n<h2>History</h2>\n<p>Once a mortal humanoid, the Axiomatic General ascended to become deified, although it is unclear what exactly it once was as virtually all races have a legendary historical figure that has risen from the mortal ranks to those of the divine after following the path of a great warrior who tirelessly supported its deity. What is evident is that the Overseer of War became more powerful than this original deity and ended up judging it at the culmination of a long conflict. The Lord of All War’s final verdict and victory provided the energy and evidence needed for the warrior to rise to godhood itself.</p>\n<p>The Axiomatic General tends to appear in history (as the simple warrior of its humanoid type) when the race’s pre-eminent lawful deity first wages war against more than one non-lawful foe, whether they be good, evil, or chaotic. It goes by many titles (a few of which appear above) but always has the ability to make clear, concise, and entirely accurate decisions even in the heat and fog of combat. Tales invariably tell of the Overseer of War having to uphold the lawful aims and ambitions of another deity’s followers when the god or goddess itself proves to be weak and fallible. Then the Axiomatic General steps in to save those same worshipers before judging the god in question and finding it wanting. After this, it takes the fight to the enemy, turns the tide of the war with unquestionable judgement, and becomes a deity in its own right. After this, the Lord of All Wars is always found leading those who know its words to be the truth through conflict, disagreement, and dispute—a reliable route to absolute, undeniable victory.</p>\n<h2>Relationships</h2>\n<p>The Overseer of War is entirely dismissive of any and all other deities that do not in some part embrace lawful beliefs. While those that promote chaos feel its full wrath, the Axiomatic General constantly seeks to disprove the tenets of neutral good and neutral evil deities because of their reliance on sentimental or self-centred emotions. It tolerates lawful good and lawful evil gods as long as their lawful nature is at the forefront of their actions, and is just as likely to support a lawfully-minded archon in a conflict against an evil devil as it is a lawfully-minded devil that wages war against an overly-good archon; ultimately, the balance of law is what is important.</p>\n<p>The Axiomatic General is opposed by all those who promote personal choice, uncontrolled actions, and “belief”—it is guaranteed to come into conflict with deities that support and nurture bards and barbarians, and frequently with those that nurture wild sorcerers. Because it is so closely linked with conclusive and categorical truth, the Lord of All Wars sometimes finds itself on the side of sages, experts, philosophers and academics that devote their lives to uncovering a lost or hidden truth, whether military, legal, commercial, or magical.</p>\n<h2>Appearance</h2>\n<p>The Axiomatic General usually appears as a healthy, vibrant member of the appropriate race and can be either female or male (or neither). Its clothing is always practical for the situation but is clearly designed to instil confidence and invariably a bright white. The god’s symbol, the decorated iron rod, is sewn into the space above the heart and mimicked by the weapon it wields. The Overseer of War always carries a +3 axiomatic brilliant energy light mace, the look and effect of which are in line with the main domain of the senior cleric in the vicinity as follows:</p>\n<table style=\"float:left;width:99.5833%;height:113px\" border=\"1\">\n<tbody>\n<tr style=\"height:32.5px\">\n<td style=\"width:47.7664%;height:32.5px;background-color:#000000;border-color:#ffffff\">\n<h3><span style=\"color:#ffffff\"><strong>Domain</strong></span></h3>\n</td>\n<td style=\"width:52.2358%;height:32.5px;background-color:#000000;border-color:#ffffff\">\n<h3><span style=\"color:#ffffff\"><strong>Rod type</strong></span></h3>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height:20.125px\">\n<td style=\"width:47.7664%;height:20.125px;background-color:#ecf0f1;border-color:#000000\">Law</td>\n<td style=\"width:52.2358%;height:20.125px;background-color:#ecf0f1;border-color:#000000\">Alertness</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height:20.125px\">\n<td style=\"width:47.7664%;height:20.125px;background-color:#ecf0f1;border-color:#000000\">Nobility</td>\n<td style=\"width:52.2358%;height:20.125px;background-color:#ecf0f1;border-color:#000000\">Splendour</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height:20.125px\">\n<td style=\"width:47.7664%;height:20.125px;background-color:#ecf0f1;border-color:#000000\">Strength</td>\n<td style=\"width:52.2358%;height:20.125px;background-color:#ecf0f1;border-color:#000000\">Flailing</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height:20.125px\">\n<td style=\"width:47.7664%;height:20.125px;background-color:#ecf0f1;border-color:#000000\">War</td>\n<td style=\"width:52.2358%;height:20.125px;background-color:#ecf0f1;border-color:#000000\">Rulership</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>Legends dictate that the Axiomatic General occasionally appears as a fully advanced, adamantine-coated marut, but the last occasion this was recorded was many generations ago.</p>\n<h2>Providence</h2>\n<p>Followers and clergy of the Lord of All Wars know that clarity of planning, deeper understanding of the way forward, or insight into a problem that has been gained after careful thought and consideration has come from their deity. This knowledge doesn’t appear suddenly but is the reward for taking time and exploring all possibilities. The Oversee of War thinks highly of those who consider their options before acting decisively, as well as of those who follow through with long-term plans without faltering.</p>\n<p>Any sign of plans failing, the confusion reigning, or participants not understanding their role is seen as a sign that the Axiomatic General is displeased and expects greater discipline and forethought.</p>\n<h2>Servants</h2>\n<p>The Axiomatic General rewards those who organize well and keep to agreed plans, no matter how long this may take. These machinations often take many generations in the case of shorter-lived humanoids such as goblinoids and humans, or the entire life of the longest-living elves. Servants must be prepared to sacrifice the immediate for the longer term, understand that they may lose those around them today for the betterment of a lawful population tomorrow, and recognize that the needs of a lawful future outweigh any considerations here and now.</p>\n<p>The Overseer of War grants particular favour to those who constantly uphold the law—inevitables are viewed with esteem alongside formians and other hive-minded creatures. Followers that devote themselves to a lifetime of achieving a long-term lawful aim regularly receive insight and clarity from their god. Humanoids that either spend a significant portion of their time gaining greater insight into a particular path or are able to rapidly judge the features and benefits of a number of possibilities before quickly making the correct decision often gain a divine hint or two.</p>\n<h2>The Church of the Axiomatic General</h2>\n<p>Sites of worship to the Lord of All Wars serve one purpose: to ensure that correct decision are made to further indisputable truth. They range in size from an officer’s table in their tent, a simple sand tablet on which a cleric explains a truth, or in a lawyer’s or sage’s rooms, to the chambers of a country’s most magnificent courtroom, the order flags at the front line of the latest battle in a war, or the grandest library within the @UUID[JournalEntry.QVrlu0lTv2vFtT5P]{Klavek Kingdom} most spectacular cathedral to the Axiomatic General. Churches to this god are all simple, plain affairs that remove mental distraction and clutter at the same time as allowing axioms and tenets spoken by the Overseer of War to be spread effectively and efficiently.</p>\n<p>Worship of the Axiomatic General is frequently silent as followers consider practical issues at hand as well as long-term problems that require a more considered solution. Followers frequently engage in debates, most of which are serious but enjoyable affairs—there is no time for frivolous thought when the Lord of All War’s tenets are involved—although there is no sense of “victory or defeat” in these sessions (the aim is to reach the truest, most accurate solution to a question, and everybody learns something.) When necessary, churches of the Overseer of War provide a neutral meeting point between warring factions of good and evil, although only the most experienced and senior of clergy attempt to mediate between chaotic elements. The Axiomatic General has shown that the wisest course for followers of law is to work together to overcome chaos through any means possible before resolving philosophical and personal lawful differences using contemplation and debate.</p>\n<p>The clergy of the Overseer of War organize themselves in a clear and obvious hierarchy in the same way that any modern military, business, or courtroom would do. Similarly, religious and educational centres that follow the Axiomatic General have a plain structure in place that shows who has best demonstrated an understanding of the god’s aims and objectives. No matter where or how the Lord of All War is followed, its churches are defined by their grasp of unequivocal truths, unimpeachable laws, unbeatable tactics, and unquestionable enlightenment. Churches that exhibit knowledge over belief and can demonstrate undeniable evidence for these truths have the greatest standing, no matter what their size. Worshipers rise up the ranks in the same way: anyone who can establish irrefutable knowledge and information is given ever greater responsibilities. At the same time, mistakes aren’t considered a failure if the individuals concerned can show they did all they could to establish clarity and a considered answer. All they have to do is recognize that further investigation has produced better knowledge and make sure they don’t repeat the mistake. As the Lord of All Wars is happy to develop plans over many generations, errors that can be rectified bear little consequence.</p>\n<p>Churches worshipping the Axiomatic General are openly found in the centre of lawful societies and on the outskirts of those populations with no preference for law or chaos but are seemingly absent from chaotic cultures. The Overseer of War prefers his followers to surround such cultures and gradually move inwards until the chaos is crushed out of them—a process that takes as long as is necessary, designed to ensure no worshiper is tricked into joining chaos from within.</p>\n<p>Services to the Axiomatic General are ordered affairs, comprising either contemplation of the truth or respectful presentation of findings and subsequent decision-making they influence. In all situations, there is ample opportunity for everyone who wants to speak to do so, although followers recognize the need to act swiftly during war situations and develop a truncated, precise style of presenting their findings.</p>\n<h2>Worshipers</h2>\n<p>The Axiomatic General is primarily worshipped by military officers but also draws in judges, lawyers, barristers, sages, monks, and those who would advance society in an ordered and structured way. Those who indulge in chaotic thoughts and acts are ignored at all times.</p>\n<h2>Clergy</h2>\n<p>The clergy of the Overseer of War are not necessarily clerics, although if they aren’t they are only allowed to represent the god within their own sphere of expertise and influence (for example, military officers can only lead services and discussions about military matters). Any member of the clergy who is a cleric is required to lead a service in an overarching capacity even if the content is decided by the senior subject expert. In all situations, the most experience cleric leads a service, with assistance as appropriate from other members of the congregation.</p>\n<p>The Axiomatic General does not support paladins, despite their martial outlook. Their tendency towards good leads them to not always consider the balanced needs of a lawful life, which in turn means their judgment isn’t always going to be the best it can be in some situations.</p>\n<h2>Temples and Shrines</h2>\n<p>Buildings devoted to the Lord of All Wars are functional, unadorned, designed to serve all aspects of the god’s tenets, yet clearly focused on one domain more than others (whatever that may be). It isn’t unusual for there to be four temples next to each other—one for each aspect of devotion with followers visiting whichever is most appropriate for their needs.</p>\n<p>All sites of worship have one item in common: a magical lead box with an amazing lock that holds a copy of the four holy texts of the Axiomatic General (The Four Planes of Certain Truth) plus one additional book of specific thoughts on the area of expertise of the congregation. These boxes are identical as adornment or elaboration is forbidden as an unnecessary distraction, and are always at the centre of any service of worship or decision-making process. Whenever the box is locked after its final use for the day, the text within each book is updated via divine intervention if a more accurate and truthful version of any piece of information has been discovered and when new facts have been uncovered.</p>\n<p>Each place of worship also contains the thought processes of anyone who has worked to uncover indisputable truths, as well as the evidence that demonstrates that truth. Whenever someone is uncovering a new truth, their work-in-progress materials are stored here as well.</p>\n<h2>Holy Texts</h2>\n<p>The Four Planes of Certain Truth contain the pertinent and unequivocal statements confirmed by the Axiomatic General. When stored in their magical box they are updated via divine intervention when it is locked at the end of the day. No decision is made without this box being present, even if it isn’t used. Clerics of the Overseer of War receive notification of changes as part of their meditation; all clerics and service leaders are encouraged to learn the texts by heart (as interpretation isn’t required).</p>\n<p>Each book bears a simple cover, binding, and little decoration other than an iron rod over a stylized letter that identifies its contents. Other documents stored at temples and shrines have these two symbols plus the initials of the author and the date of publication. When any document is superseded, the date of its relegation from cannon is stamped on the cover and the original symbols are scored through.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h3><em><strong>Axioms of War</strong></em></h3>\n<p>This contains the latest approved plans for war as a whole, as well as tactics for individual fights. The core content—when consulted prior to a battle—confers both a confidence-boosting and calming effect as it confirms how its actions bring eventual victory in the war (with that day’s battle an important part of it). Chapters detail the stages of engagement and explain the surest way forward at each point. They describe how a lawful plan can be overcome by the sheer weight of chaos, but also how to learn from that experience and counter it in the next battle.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<h3><em><strong>Axioms of Law</strong></em></h3>\n<p>This contains the latest approved plans for passing legal judgment as a whole, as well as tactics for individual cases. When consulted prior to establishing guilt or innocence, it confers both a clarity- and authority-boosting effect as it confirms how its actions ensure the correct judgment is reached. Chapters detail the stages of ascertaining the truth from all that has been presented as evidence as well as methods to consider it in an effective, efficient, and impartial manner. They also describe how well-made laws can be twisted and broken by the inherently devious, and how to rewrite those laws to ensure this doesn’t happen in future.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<h3><em><strong>Axioms of Decisions</strong></em></h3>\n<p>This contains the latest methods and directions for effective and efficient meditation as well as long-established research techniques from the church’s greatest sages and experts. When consulted before an investigation is started, it confers a mind-clearing and attention-focusing effect as it confirms how its actions allow a user to reveal the most pertinent and accurate information. Chapters detail how to consider what needs to be discovered, how to ensure what is found matches the initial requirements, and then how to use the information to make the correct decision. They also describe how distraction, obfuscation, and distortion of aims and objects (such as shortcuts) lead to an incorrect decision with long-term consequences.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<h3><em><strong>Axioms of Enlightenment</strong></em></h3>\n<p>This contains pathways to understanding the world at large and the part one plays in that world as well as how the best of life is achieved through the order. When consulted before meditating, it confers an open-mindedness that ensures the route to enlightenment is properly followed as it confirms how its actions allow a user to reach self-knowledge without deviation or distraction. Chapters give details on what to do before, during, and after meditation, as well as how to realize enlightenment has been reached. They also describe how our contemplation can be lessened by the actions of others, but how these digressions can be overcome and enlightenment eventually reached.</p>\n<h2>Holidays</h2>\n<p>The Axiomatic General is not celebrated at any specific festivals. Instead, when the law prevails during any of the god’s areas of interest, followers offer a prayer of thanks no more than 30 minutes after the event. If gratitude is shown later than this, it probably means the follower was distracted from the task at hand and has acted in a chaotic way to make the thanks fit in. Better to acknowledge the effect of the Overseer of War with one’s body and mind than take yourself away from a pressing matter and make two situations chaotic.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n</div>","markdown":""},"_id":"OB8fp8gIre5yoZax","image":{},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"sort":400000,"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"JournalEntry.0FSVjV3WkdoAk7OX.JournalEntryPage.K8IEnGHHZ3800Nio"}}},{"name":"Ancestor Spirit","type":"text","title":{"show":false,"level":1},"text":{"format":1,"content":"<div class=\"aventyr\">\n<p class=\"s5\">Ancestor Spirit</p>\n<img style=\"margin:0px 10px 10px 0px;border:0px;float:right\" src=\"modules/aaw-games-aventyr/Deities-Images/waterfall_edit-scaled.webp\" width=\"244\" height=\"698\" />\n<p><strong>Titles: </strong>Breath of Life, Life Spirit</p>\n<p><strong>Home: </strong>Positive energy plane</p>\n<p><strong>Alignment: </strong>NG</p>\n<p><strong>Portfolio: </strong>Ancestor, nature, wilderness, wisdom</p>\n<p><strong>Worshippers:</strong> @UUID[JournalEntry.QlctNkzE9injOde9.JournalEntryPage.I4CpK8rTs0HgD7hW]{Vikmordere}</p>\n<p><strong>Domains: </strong>Animal, Community, Plant</p>\n<p><strong>Subdomains: </strong>Ancestors, Seasons, Souls</p>\n<p><strong>Favored Weapon: </strong>Wooden staff</p>\n<p>The Ancestor Spirit venerates reconnection with nature, and exploration of one’s inner being without the scourge of individual financial gain.</p>\n<p>    The pure energy which forms this deity is comprised of the souls of the original ancient settlers of the @UUID[JournalEntry.QVrlu0lTv2vFtT5P]{Klavek Kingdom}/@UUID[JournalEntry.Cg0Nt8mDPQ7JrmyB]{Vikmordere}.

He was dissatisfied; dwarves had become a lesser race, overcome by the @UUID[JournalEntry.QlctNkzE9injOde9.JournalEntryPage.8HyVcZ70eyhwNJsu]{Drow}, among others. His life was punctuated by constant struggle and heroic feats that are the things of legend: he re-mastered the lost arts of metalworking once known by his ancestors; he defended his homeland single-handedly against creatures of the Underworld, and he built himself a flawless suit of unbreakable armour. Inside this shell, he was an unstoppable force, and Balir took back thousands of miles of once-dwarven lands. He rose higher than any before making the fatal flaw of offering his hand in peace to the drow.</p>\n<p>The story goes that the Drow cast a curse of burning into his unbreakable armour, sealing the dwarf inside and setting it ablaze forever. But at this moment the gods saw Balir as the greatest martyr of his people and granted him a spark of divinity; he awoke as a god, still within the armour that had become his tomb, and departed the mortal realm.</p>\n<p>Having risen from the ranks of mortals, Balir has been forced to prove himself to the gods over and over again, showing them he is worthy. His feats as a god are no less than his feats as a mortal, although they take place in realms far beyond man’s comprehension. It is from one of these divine toils that he claimed his mighty hammer, Soul Forger – a weapon clearly claimed from a creature many times larger than Balir himself.</p>\n<p>Even as he found himself a god, Balir kept his destroyed mortal form as a sign of his penance. Instead of divine flesh, he constructed a metal body for himself to replace the one he lost. This new skin is without the flaw of mercy that destroyed him as a mortal. And although Balir’s scarred face is unmistakably dwarven, his body is anything but. A cast of white mithral and black iron, he appears more machine than man. Now, even with his drow-cursed armour destroyed, he still blazes with the murderous fire; in his chest, he carries a spark from which the sun was born. When he does not appear in his divine form, Balir assumes the guise of a young dwarf, typically bearing scars on his face and arms from flame.</p>\n<h2>Churches, Clergy, and Worshippers</h2>\n<p>Churches to Balir are at once humble and magnificent. Their areas of worship are simple and unadorned, although always practical, in a manner befitting dwarven life itself. Whether the smallest shrine or grandest cathedral, sites dedicated to Balir always stand near a place of work, toil, and creation. In them, they are guided by Balir’s ancient knowledge and secrets to produce machines, mechanical goods, and works of active art unlike anywhere else in the world. Balir’s clergy are predominantly dwarven, although some humans do acclaim his faith as well. Where they can, they dress in mithral and crimson – styling themselves after their god. Poorer members of the faith dress instead in white and yellow. Worshippers almost always offer constructed items as their offering. If they do resort to just money, it’s always directed toward a newly-qualified crafter or a promising apprentice.</p>\n<h2>Holy Text</h2>\n<p>The Life of Balir is unlike any standard book of holy teachings. Instead, this tome is almost three thousand pages long and details the thousand trials and tribulations of Balir’s life, written in such a way that it is more like a dwarven self-help book than divine instruction. Some versions have additional volumes discussing the merits of each action Balir took, although these are known to be opinions, not facts. The original text is unchanged from when it was penned by Balir’s own son, after the dwarf’s ascension to godhood.</p>\n</div>","markdown":""},"_id":"SjKuUjzrx9TNLn0y","image":{},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"sort":500000,"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"JournalEntry.EykWA9hRZOjLFz6G.JournalEntryPage.JtgEqWY5XOkGnzgZ"}}},{"name":"The Current","type":"text","title":{"show":false,"level":1},"text":{"format":1,"content":"<div class=\"aventyr\">\n<p class=\"s5\">The Current</p>\n<img style=\"float:right;margin:0px 10px 10px 0px;border:0px\" src=\"modules/aaw-games-aventyr/Deities-Images/The-Current.webp\" width=\"267\" height=\"316\" />\n<p><strong>Alignment:</strong> LN</p>\n<p><strong>Portfolio:</strong> Insanity, Mysticism, Seas, Underworld Waters, the Unknown</p>\n<p><strong>Domains:</strong> Madness (Nightmare), Magic (Arcane), Void (Dark Tapestry), Water (Oceans)</p>\n<p><strong>Favoured Weapon:</strong> Tentacle (whips, spiked chains)</p>\n<p><strong>Favored Animals:</strong> Octopus, Squid</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>History</h2>\n<p>The other deities of Aventyr are forever vigilant for even the slightest brush of the Current’s tentacles in their plans or near their essence, keeping a respectful distance from the maddening god. Its motives are totally unpredictable, though it strikes swiftly and without warning when it is suited to do so. The affairs of the gods don’t seem to bear any interest to the Current, however, and it is thought to be slumbering, like the massive beasts that lay in the ruins of the vestraadi’s ancient civilizations. Indeed, some believe that these enormous predators are somehow related to the maddening god and not without good reason; they appeared not long after the Current came to Aventyr.</p>\n<h2>Appearance</h2>\n<p>Records of The Current’s appearance are extremely vague by necessity; those that look upon it are driven utterly mad. The few reliable accounts claim that it is floating, slithering or pulsating mass of writhing tentacles, the end of each covered in barbs of colours for which there is no shade or name.</p>\n<h2>Churches of the Maddening God</h2>\n<p>These revered houses of worship completely encompass those within them, covered in sculptures of tentacles that extend throughout the structure. The holiest of these churches are actually made from the recovered limbs of enormous squids and octopuses—the architecture within them drives any non-followers of the Current to madness, afflicting any creature within with a form of insanity should they fail a DC 16 Wisdom saving throw.</p>\n<h2>Holy Text</h2>\n<p>No books exist for the religion of the maddening god; instead, the vestraadi keep song strings. When wound or unwound underwater, these magical cords play hymns of the Current’s religion (in a tongue those that hear them can understand). The holiest and most valuable of these song strings are said to relate the true origins of the aquatic deity but are said to drive those that hear them mad with the voice of the Current, cursed to forever live with its echo in their mind.</p>\n<h2>Vast Swamp</h2>\n<p>@UUID[JournalEntry.g4odaMsHbRkeNFhn.JournalEntryPage.oIbJsrbNZu7GVWp9#the-muddy-mangroves]{The Muddy Mangroves} has always been the center of the Current’s clergy in the Vast Swamp.

The others chose their domains carefully, but Eureum took his from necessity. For, there must be balance in life as there must be balance in death.

It is said, that beneath the cowl, he perpetually weeps.</p>\n<p>   When he does not appear in a humanoid form, he appears as a collection of dry autumn leaves blowing in the wind.</p>\n<h2>Church of Eureum</h2>\n<p>Much to his dismay, most of Eureum’s churches are misguided, focusing only on one aspect – either death or rebirth – and are often fanatical in their beliefs. He considers only a few shrines to him, often deep within forests and away from civilization, to be true churches.</p>\n<h2>Worshippers and Clergy</h2>\n<p>Eureum’s followers are more often fanatics than they are proper clergy, focusing either on bringing either death or life wherever they go instead of maintaining the cycle of life and death.</p>\n<p> His true followers dress in dirty brown robes, often matted with dried leaves and crawling with tiny insects.</p>\n<h2>Holy Text</h2>\n<p>On Death: This book details the cycle of death, and life, and how all life depends on death for sustenance as much as death depends on life – for one is impossible without the other.

Her mother, Laelstra, was the Matron’s personal seeress. Hivaka possessed only the slightest of her mother’s magical abilities, mastering cantrips at an early age, but progressing no further. Being the youngest daughter, barely older than her only brother, and her sisters already being groomed for succession to various positions within the House, Hivaka found herself being used as leverage but almost everyone around her.</p>\n<p>    Hivaka’s father, Elkerd, was first son of House Kilduis, allies of House Ruim. Among Elkerd’s vices was gambling—he never minded losing, as long as fun was had by all. The problems began when he started using House Kildius’ assets to cover his wagers. When he was financially cut off from House Kilduis, he took the step of offering his youngest daughter, Hivaka, to the winner of a game of orbben. When Elkerd lost to Imfein of House Rilyntyl, a rival of House Kilduis, Hivaka was taken from her home by force. Laelstra protested, but there were too many reliable witnesses to the wager for her challenges to hold sway over her Matron. Thus, Hivaka was taken into slavery by House Rilyntyl. Laelstra attempted to buy Hivaka from Imfein, but was rebuffed, as having a bargaining chip against House Kilduis’ ally was worth much more than gold.</p>\n<p>     Aside from the hard labour she and many others were forced to endure, Hivaka was treated well—as well as a slave could be treated, anyway. She took her enforced servitude in stride, seeing as how she had almost never held any power of significance in her life. However, she harboured a hatred for her father, not understanding how a parent could blithely hand over their child’s life to another simply to cover a bet.</p>\n<p>     The guards from House Imfein did not treat her any better or any worse than any of the other slaves. Neither did they prohibit her mother from visiting her occasionally during the evening, as long as no escape attempts were made. They did, however, restrain her from braining her father with her work hammer the one and only time he approached her during a shift of breaking up rocks. If not for the guards, Elkerd would have died violently, but possibly not quickly.</p>\n<p>     Hivaka was a slave of House Imfein for almost a full year before Laelstra recruited a large following and put a plan into action that would free Hivak: she and her cohort would attack the Imfein guards at the slave pens during the night and Hivak would escape in the confusion while wearing the battle-dress of a House Imfein sorceress.</p>\n<p>      The assault appeared to be a success as chaos reigned in the slave pens, however, Laelstra had not anticipated two things: first, there were more guards than anticipated, causing longer holdups and more casualties as the attacking mob progressed. More guards also meant that an alarm could be sounded, bringing reinforcements, which compounded the existing issues with the rescue.</p>\n<p>    The second issue was that Hivaka had determined that no matter where she was in drow society, she would be enslaved. Either to another house or within her own, where she would be used as a pawn in countless numbers of schemes by her Matron and her own family. As the youngest daughter, she held the lowest standing. Because of this, she was determined not to return to her home.</p>\n<p>    Once in possession of the Imfein battle dress, Hivaka pulled the attached hood over her head and began leading slaves away, using her implied authority, along with some well-placed and spectacular-looking cantrips, to move them without interference. She had nearly one hundred slaves with her when they left the Xdot border.</p>\n<p>   Leading them on through the night, Hivaka found a narrow cave entrance that led into a larger cavern inside. Using the last of her available magicks, Hivaka attempted to cover the mouth of the cave with an illusion showing solid rock. The image was far more effective than Hivak knew because she and her group had attracted the attention of @UUID[.2MMXPI4kINBOYNOP]{Leacim}, the only known male drow deity.</p>\n<p>     A trickster among the more serious drow goddesses, @UUID[.2MMXPI4kINBOYNOP]{Leacim} took this opportunity to thumb his nose at his sisters and to have fun, watching as the drow patrols searched the area over and over, never seeing past his illusions.</p>\n<p>     The rescued slaves began worshipping Hivaka as a saviour. She resisted their praise, saying that she was simply another slave, like them. Leacim—knowing that these slaves needed someone to look up to, invested a small amount of his power in Hivaka, raising her above the mortals, but not so high as the divine: he made her a demigoddess.</p>\n<p>     Those under her protection turned their new home into a town, called Nhlilolin, which has become a haven for the outcasts of the Underworld.</p>\n<h2>Appearance</h2>\n<p>Hivaka is short, for a drow, but heavily muscled from her time as a slave. Her light grey hair is kept short for a drow female, the ends reaching her jawline. Her eyes are blue, relatively rare in the Underworld, and if you look into them, you will find nothing but steely resolve.</p>\n<p>   Hivaka keeps her clothes simple, preferring pants and shirts that have pockets. The more pockets, the better. She is never anywhere without the hammer that she used to break the chains of the other slaves before leading them off into the night. Every morning or after any combat, she repairs the wooden handle with the mending cantrip.</p>\n<h2>Church of Hivaka</h2>\n<p>Hivaka, as a very recent demigoddess, does not have a church, but those that were rescued from imprisonment literally sing her praises every day. She downplays her role as a saviour or someone to be worshipped. She does have her devoted followers and, thanks to @UUID[.2MMXPI4kINBOYNOP]{Leacim}, she is able to grant them a small number of spells. She has not gained any paladins, though.</p>\n<h2>Worshippers and Clergy</h2>\n<p>Those who escaped with Hivaka are her greatest worshippers, but any who have escaped bondage freely speak her name with reverence. There is no set clergy in Nhilolin, but some apostles go out into the Underworld (and a few to the Upperworld) and speak against slavery, striving to free those that are held down, if only through word if not deed.</p>\n<p>     Some of these preachers will gather the like-minded with them and attempt to free those taken by slavers. These zealots do not care if they live or die, as long as those imprisoned go free.</p>\n<h2>Holy Text</h2>\n<p>The Journey: The only text that Hivaka doesn’t simply shake her head at is The Journey. This collection of parchments is the story of not only Hivaka leading the slaves of House Imfein to freedom, but every person who has escaped from an overlord is welcome to add their story to The Journey. So far, almost three hundred stories have been put into the collection.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>A second “holy text” has begun circulating throughout Nhilolin and the Underworld, speaking of Hivaka in the holiest of languages, greatly exaggerating her abilities, and almost, but not quite, painting her as the goddess who will eventually overthrow the mightiest of slavers, Naraneus herself. Hivaka has tried to explain that the book, The Light of Hivaka and the Way Forward, brings attention to her and the town, which is mentioned by name in the book, and could lead to them all being recaptured. This explanation has failed, so far.</p>\n<p> </p>\n</div>","markdown":""},"_id":"fGrUoxdeUcElXl1w","image":{},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"sort":1000000,"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"JournalEntry.0ZJ73TBS2gtaaHzz.JournalEntryPage.8ICOLekqb9Rv4c6W"}}},{"name":"Ja Qua","type":"text","title":{"show":true,"level":1},"text":{"format":1,"content":"<div class=\"aventyr\">\n<p class=\"s5\">Ja Qua</p>\n<img style=\"float:right;margin:0px 10px 10px 0px;border:0px\" src=\"modules/aaw-games-aventyr/Deities-Images/Ja-Qua.webp\" width=\"263\" height=\"235\" />\n<p><strong>Titles: </strong>Mother, Jaguar Queen, Heart of the Jungle, She Behind the Leaves</p>\n<p><strong>Home: </strong>The Fey Jungle</p>\n<p><strong>Alignment </strong>LN</p>\n<p><strong>Portfolio: </strong>Strength, The Hunt, Family</p>\n<p><strong>Worshippers:</strong> Actively worshipped by many natives of @UUID[JournalEntry.RMK7HBFDlPXDiURg]{NairaCull}</p>\n<p><strong>Domains: </strong>Strength, Animal, Law, Protection</p>\n<p><strong>Subdomains: </strong>Ferocity, Fur, Resolve</p>\n<p><strong>Favoured</strong> <strong>Weapon:</strong> Natural Claws, Maquahuitl</p>\n<p>Considered by a vast majority of the native peoples of NairaCull to be she who controls the balance of life within their lands, the worship of Ja Qua is the dominant faith within the dark nation.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>History</h2>\n<p>Ja Qua herself predates most written language, and her own followers have spent their entire lives passing down the tales told to them from previous generations, leaving her history entirely in the hands of those who revere her. Little is known to her followers of her true origins, only that she has proven to be an active and loyal spiritual force within the lives of those who never looked away from the older forms of worship.</p>\n<p>   Ja Qua exists within a sub-dimension connected to the mainlands of the Seelie Court and has fostered a deep relationship with the fey of her lands, looking upon them with the same love and care as her human followers. In turn, the fey has come to view her as one of their own and a revered person of power amongst their courts, and will not hesitate to interact on her behalf within her lands.</p>\n<h2>Appearance</h2>\n<p>Ja Qua appears in one of two forms when she chooses to appear at all. The first is that of a monstrously large and physically powerful jaguar, golden tawny in colour with spots that appear to shift and move before one’s eyes. Crowned with a rim of bony protrusions across her brow and snout, there is no mistaking Ja Qua in her feline form as the self-appointed Queen of her lands. Her second form is one of far more subtlety, one of an attractive woman, typically still keeping the tawny colour of her pelt within her long hair. The colour of her eyes in human form is said to be indescribable, as no true colour exists within nature to compare them to, and her voice will both seduce and petrify you with fear in the same instant.</p>\n<h2>Church of Ja Qua</h2>\n<p>Ja Qua’s worship is strongest within the lands of @UUID[JournalEntry.RMK7HBFDlPXDiURg]{NaeraCull}, though there is the random shrine amongst a few forgotten uncivilized locations, where the march of progress has not severed all of humanity's connection to the Seelie Court yet.</p>\n<h2>Worshippers and Clergy</h2>\n<p>Those tribal warriors deemed worthy are put through a ritualistic challenge to earn Ja Qua’s Blessing, the gift of lycanthropy. Those who survive the process of transformation, and are not driven mad by the ritualistic pain they must go through to prove their worth find themselves in a position of honour amongst the tribes and temples, utilized as guardians and hunters, protecting both the faith and an ancient way of life. Dressed in only a loincloth these warriors tend to embrace the custom of adorning themselves with colourful trinkets and baubles to mark victories over adversaries, or glorious hunts.</p>\n<p>    Those of great enough faith, but not physical stamina to serve the tribes as warriors tend the temples and altars of Ja Qua as her loyal clerics. Over time those of the deepest devotion begin to acquire certain feline traits, though they never achieve the full embrace of Ja Qua as the temple warriors do.</p>\n<h2>Holy Text</h2>\n<p>Scattered throughout the jungle are many lost ruins of forgotten tribes, within which are wall carvings and bas-reliefs depicting the teachings of various points in the history of the church of Ja Qua. Most of the written language of the people of NairaCull is pictographic and has never been compiled into text or bound format, although it is rumoured that a man travels the jungle seeking to do just that.</p>\n<h2>The Dralman Documents</h2>\n<p>A skald of some renown, Theo Dralman was quested by the Grand University of @UUID[JournalEntry.QVrlu0lTv2vFtT5P.JournalEntryPage.dwAJ5Jtc6ii8zQoh]{Mohkba} to enter the dark jungle and learn all he could of the spirits to which the native people prayed, and how the @UUID[JournalEntry.QVrlu0lTv2vFtT5P]{Klavek Kingdom} could use this information to its own end. That was many years ago, and many of the legends spoken amongst the tribes that have encountered Dralman would lead one to believe that his goals have changed, and his search for knowledge has become something far more personal. Most of the legends speak of a man carrying a great many scars, as if he had been mauled to the edge of death, only to be spared and shown a new path. There exist a few rare copies of his incomplete work, taken to the coastal towns by couriers and those on safari…the Dralman Documents they have become known as. All public possession of these documents within the borders of Klavekian-controlled lands is considered treasonous and punishable by seizure of properties and goods, as well as incarceration.</p>\n<p> </p>\n</div>","markdown":""},"_id":"21VmQoL4MPe6mX6q","image":{},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"sort":1100000,"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"JournalEntry.LQT16PQtjrxETCAe.JournalEntryPage.3JNs1m50QSpNDrdf"}}},{"name":"Leacim","type":"text","title":{"show":false,"level":1},"text":{"format":1,"content":"<div class=\"aventyr\">\n<p class=\"s5\">Leacim</p>\n<img style=\"float:right;margin:0px 10px 10px 0px;border:0px\" src=\"modules/aaw-games-aventyr/Deities-Images/Leacim.webp\" width=\"262\" height=\"371\" />\n<p><strong>Titles: </strong>The Clever Shadow</p>\n<p><strong>Symbol: </strong>Spinning 8-faceted gem</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary)\"><strong style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">Alignment: </strong>CN</span></p>\n<p><strong>Portfolio: </strong>Chance, Guile, Illusion, Misfortune, Self-Determination, Thieves</p>\n<p><strong>Domains: </strong>Chaos, Entropy, Deception, Luck, Trickery</p>\n<p><strong>Favoured</strong> <strong>Weapon:</strong> Scimitar, Shortbow, Throwing Knife</p>\n<p><strong>Favoured Animals:</strong> Any beast with camouflage or mimicry (such as a chameleon, stick bug, etc)</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>History</h2>\n<p>The Aventyr god known as Leacim was once a forgotten deity, supplanted by the doings of the colloid aeons before it ever reached the Underworld. Once a treasured god of cunning and wisdom, he was left bereft in the void of the cosmos—when Leacim stared into the void, something from the far beyond stared back. Now slightly deranged and without an identity, the god capered throughout the universe with a will and desire at the whim of his growing insanity.</p>\n<p>   Eventually, the divine energies wrought on Aventyr during the Forging of the Dvergr caught Leacim’s attention, drawing him to the periphery of the world to witness the rise of the progenitors and their fall into the draaki. It was the elven deities, however, that most interested the god of misfortune—over hundreds of years, he subtly infiltrated their pantheon and species, attributing fanatical devotees in the very flesh before spreading them across both Upper- and Underworld. He appeared inexplicably among the elven pantheon, fully adopting the drow form and gathering followers both before and after their exodus from Edhellond.</p>\n<p>     The most famous of these followers is @UUID[.fGrUoxdeUcElXl1w]{Hivaka} , the Savior of the Masses. Leacim took notice when she and her fellow slaves took flight from Xdot. He imparted the aspiring dark elf with some of his divine essences, forever transforming her into a demigoddess.</p>\n<p>   Leacim continues to take an active (albeit underhanded) role in the continued existence of the drow. He travels through the Underworld, briefly touching the souls of dark elves and morphing their alignments towards chaos, neutrality or even goodness if it suits his mood. The lone raider D’thul, a cannibalistic sorcerer-barbarian in the Fungi Forest near Holoth, is one such drow. Those on the surface often see their lives subtly influenced by the trickster god, and Leacim leads them to roles of dubious natures and unexpected rewards.</p>\n<h2>Special</h2>\n<p>Leacim takes delight in angering the other @UUID[JournalEntry.QlctNkzE9injOde9.JournalEntryPage.8HyVcZ70eyhwNJsu]{Drow} gods at every opportunity; his followers may substitute Leacim as the required diety for any item, class, feat or spell that has a drow deity requirement and may select the Drow domain if they have access to domains. Moreover, he often creates his own agents of change—players that wish to play a drow of good alignment in a place that would otherwise prohibit that choice may choose Leacim as their deity to avoid that caveat.</p>\n<h2>Appearance</h2>\n<p>The trickster god has numerous guises but he most commonly appears as an affably dressed male half-drow with an alluring grin or a blonde human girl, regardless of form, both have piercing blue eyes. Leacim’s clothing is generally fashionable and appropriate for the environment, though it is sometimes slightly tattered and seemingly in a state of disrepair. He casually saunters seemingly without a care in the world, a scimitar on his side and a black-lacquered short bow across his back, in the female form he carries only a single knife as a weapon which always returns to him when thrown.</p>\n<h2>Shrines to the Trickster</h2>\n<p>Leacim doesn’t have proper churches—effigies and the like are hidden in plain sight or are places of secret pilgrimage. These shrines are often made to look like they belong to other deities, and only show their true forms when the correct prayers are uttered. Followers that fail a DC 28 Knowledge (religion) check find their god distempered with them after praying at one of these shrines, though they remain unsure as to why (regardless of any divination spells they cast).</p>\n<h2>Holy Text</h2>\n<p>Leacim’s Lexicon is a treasured tome among thieves’ guilds, hidden drow enclaves and the trickster god’s followers. These books appear as unremarkable journals of unremarkable lives to followers of other deities (DC 26 Wisdom saving throw to negate) but in the hands of a devoted acolyte, provide a means to learn any rogue trick, illusion spell, or access to knowledge of prestige classes that require sneak attack as a prerequisite.</p>\n<h2>The Vast Swamp</h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:Signika, sans-serif\">Leahcim has taken root in the @UUID[JournalEntry.g4odaMsHbRkeNFhn]{Vast Swamp}, his trickster ways helping some daredevil rogues on their quest to lessen the burden of treasure on the vile dragons. It must be added that the tales of the rogues have become known but so far none have surfaced to verify these claims. Recently some inhabitants in the marshes have voiced their concerns—that these rumors are merely planted by Leahcim himself for some unknown reason—but the trickster god has plans and schemes no mere mortal can hope to discern.</span></p>\n</div>","markdown":""},"_id":"2MMXPI4kINBOYNOP","image":{},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"sort":1200000,"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"JournalEntry.fAaBvRaalStVHLAa.JournalEntryPage.CYEQQN8Bs7oSr3YE"}}},{"name":"Musta’Vohi","type":"text","title":{"show":false,"level":1},"text":{"format":1,"content":"<div class=\"aventyr\"><p class=\"s5\">Musta’Vohi</p><p><strong>Titles: </strong>God Mother, Heavenly Concubine</p><p><strong>Homel: </strong>Everywhere</p><p><strong>Symbol: </strong>A goat’s head painted black</p><p><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary)\"><strong style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">Alignment: </strong>NE</span></p><p><strong>Portfolio: </strong>Birth, Health, Motherhood, Lust, Pregnancy</p><p><strong>Domains: </strong>Charm, Darkness, Healing, Protection</p><p><strong>Favoured</strong> <strong>Weapon:</strong> Spiked chain</p><p> </p><h2>History</h2><p>According to the @UUID[JournalEntry.dHHrcptCELfN05gb.JournalEntryPage.Tc1kTiX3bvQt4Jd7]{Yerek}, Musta’Vohi created the universe from the sheer will to reproduce.

She wears a simple brown shawl over a simple brown cloak that has the hood pulled back.

This light both warmed the cosmos and struck out against the darkness that also appeared. This light, both protective and aggressive is embodied in Naneth. She is both Leaf Mother and Warrior Mother.</p>\n<p>   Naneth (NAH neth), her sister @UUID[.leuKpASroHy7r6sn]{Naraneus}, and their brother @UUID[.zNH5DtHDKD52Ufaf]{Onael} created the first elves. Naneth comforted and warmed the elves, but she also taught them to defend themselves. She showed them to care for each other and themselves, but they only had each other to rely on. As the elves evolved, she became more of a mothering figure to them, offsetting the chaotic presence of Naraneus, while Onael drifted away from the family.</p>\n<p>    Eventually, Naraneus became jealous of Naneth’s mothering ways and began a feud between the two that would last for ages and eventually encompass the elves as well, two groups choosing a deity to follow. Naraneus lost and the elves that followed her were banished from Edhellond.</p>\n<p>    Once the war was over, Naneth reflected on Naraneus’s deceit. She decided that if she could not trust her own sister, her children couldn’t trust anyone else. She instructed the Matriarch to retreat completely within @UUID[JournalEntry.wVQiwLZtRuaqbpFA]{Edhellond, the Silent Forest}.</p>\n<p>    Trade relations with the other races suddenly ceased and there was no response from envoys sent to the elves. The entire elven society retreated into Edhellond, turning entirely to hunting, agriculture, and magic; forsaking any trade or relations with other races.</p>\n<p>   Naneth taught the elves that they were to rely only on themselves for everything. There would be no trade, no exchanges of information, no envoys allowed inside Edhellond and only those on secret missions benefiting elvish society were allowed to venture out from Edhellond.</p>\n<h2>Appearance</h2>\n<p>Naneth appears in two forms, befitting her dual nature. In her Asaya Naneth (Leaf Mother) form, she appears as a motherly female Elf, with long golden hair that reaches the ground and she always carries a basket of bright blue flowers. In her Maethor Naneth (Warrior Mother) guise, she appears as a tall, stout elf, dressed in leather armour and a small cap keeping her jet black hair out of the way. Regardless of how she dresses, she has a pin of her symbol at the neck of her garment. She always carries a shield that is designed to look like her symbol.</p>\n<p>    She can change between the two forms in the blink of an eye.</p>\n<h2>Church of Naneth</h2>\n<p>Naneth’s “church” is more of an outdoor shrine at the largest maple tree in the Silent Forest, Tal. Edhellond is a theocracy, led by the current Matriarch or Patriarch, who also leads the services to Naneth.</p>\n<h2>Worshippers and Clergy</h2>\n<p>All surface elves worship Naneth in either of her two forms and worship of both is the norm. Clergy outside of the Matriarch/Patriarch and the Cleric of Naneth selected by the ruler are treated equally regardless of power level or ability. The motto of the clergy is “We only have ourselves” so they do not discriminate in any way.</p>\n<h2>Holy Text</h2>\n<p>The Triploid Text: This tome is separated into sections of three, with each section beginning with a parable of Asaya Naneth, ending with a parable of Maethon Naneth, and the middle section being descriptions of the war between the elves and between Naneth and @UUID[.leuKpASroHy7r6sn]{Naraneus}.</p>\n<p>The cover of the copy that belongs to the Matriarch or Patriarch is created from several massive maple leaves.

Others claim it is the essence of the Honningsop Mushroom, the oldest living thing on the planet, elevated to godhood from the residual divine energies wrought throughout history. Its awakening may not have been caused by the pantheon’s doings, but its emergence seems to coincide with The Grand Sculpting and the Great Schism.</p>\n<p>As the endless caves of the Underworld expanded, vast chambers filled with moisture risen from tunnels hundreds of miles away, creating damp caverns of moist earth. The Natural Force seeded the subterranean breezes with its spores, creating the mushroom jungles and fungal forests of Aventyr. More than that, some of these spores carried the very children of the deity—intelligent, benevolent plant humanoids known as @UUID[JournalEntry.QlctNkzE9injOde9.JournalEntryPage.yv3q3b1HnUnZB2OT]{Funglet}.</p>\n<p>The divine beings of Aventyr generally regard the great nature deity of the Underworld with a measure of respect, if they acknowledge it at all. It answers the calls of its followers but is remarkably slow to act openly, playing the great game of the gods with a level of detachment and planning that no other deity can fathom.</p>\n<h2>Appearance</h2>\n<p>When the Natural Force does appear (which is extremely rare), it does so as a @UUID[JournalEntry.QlctNkzE9injOde9.JournalEntryPage.yv3q3b1HnUnZB2OT]{Funglet} of enormous height, colored in a kaleidoscopic mixture of all the different subtypes and carrying a gigantic club made from a fantafungi. Every patch of earth the Natural Force touches erupts with a random assortment of mushrooms immediately after he breaks contact with it, and all naturally grown barriers part their way for it and take no damage from its passing.</p>\n<h2>Church of the Natural Force</h2>\n<p>Any monument or sculpture of a mushroom serves as a shrine to the Natural Force, though acolytes of the nature deity pray to fungus of large size or greater if they are able to. Sites of particular religious significance always bear an importance to the number three, though none are sure why (save the Natural Force and its wisest adherents, though they have never revealed it).</p>\n<h2>Holy Text</h2>\n<p>The Libre Boletus is a tome crafted from boletann pages. Anyone that casually skims the book sees nothing but simple gardening tips to encourage the growth of mushrooms, but should they read it fully through, the pages transform to explain the tenets of the Natural Force’s faith.

Together, they created the beings that would become knows at elves. @UUID[.oyFVdicDq8mbjOWw]{Naneth} provided the loving and mothering aspect. She showed them how to care for and protect each other, teaching them skills they needed to survive. @UUID[.leuKpASroHy7r6sn]{Naraneus} provided the chaos that seemed to pervade this new world and taught the elves about death and destruction and how to kill for food. Onael provided the controlling aspect, teaching the elves that in order to succeed, in spite of the chaos, there needed to be order and control. He taught them leadership and command and that of all the newly formed races, the elves were the greatest of them all.</p><p>    Eventually, over the millennia, the elves evolved away from the controlled savagery and into the form that is more common today. As the world became more ordered, they needed their aggression less and opened themselves up more to the life and magic that surrounded them. Without as much violence, they began to live longer and grew smaller, as their muscles were not needed as much for combat. They understood that they did not need to conquer and control to live in the modern world and accepted their place, arriving in @UUID[JournalEntry.wVQiwLZtRuaqbpFA]{Edhellond}, the Elven land that would become known as the Silent Forest.</p><p>   Onael did not understand. He thought he had taught them correctly. Seeing that the elves had turned their back on him, he took what he considered his “children,” the Edheliast, and retreated from the world to the Forgotten Forest, a demiplane that he considered his home.</p><p>    In the Forgotten Forest, the Edheliast continue to fight for survival, growing bigger, stronger, faster, and more cunning. They fight against animals, magical beasts, and even the souls of dead elves and drow that Onael claims before @UUID[.oyFVdicDq8mbjOWw]{Naneth} or @UUID[.leuKpASroHy7r6sn]{Naraneus} can.</p><p>    Recently, Onael has begun work to reclaim the elves as his own. He has many Edheliast to fight for him and he has created a new beast that will surely be a surprise to the elves.</p><h2>Appearance</h2><p>Onael appears as an Elf of immense size. He stands close to fifteen feet tall and is very heavily muscled. His dark hair is close cropped and shows off a widow’s peak. He is dressed conservatively, wearing only a black tunic with his symbol on the left breast, black pants, and black boots. On his left hip rest his longsword Coiasan.</p><p> Images of @UUID[.oyFVdicDq8mbjOWw]{Naneth}, @UUID[.leuKpASroHy7r6sn]{Naraneus}, and Onael show that there is a sibling similarity between the three, but Onael claims that he has no sisters.</p><h2>Church</h2><p>There is no church of Onael. There are no services or high priests, only combat. The Edheliant serve Onael by fighting and honing their skills.</p><h2>Worshippers and Clergy</h2><p>Every Edheliant worships Onael in trials by combat. The Edheliant dedicate every battle they participate in to Onael’s glory and ask for him to fill their bodies with power to crush their enemies.</p><p>   There is no church hierarchy. Those that Onael graces with the merest fraction of his power use the spells granted to them to enhance the combat abilities of their comrades and themselves. Onael’s clerics call themselves “Sword Arms” and mostly use spells that increase Strength or Constitution but will also make liberal use of Cure spells and Channeling Energy (if Neutral) to make sure they and their comrades can continue fighting.</p><h2>Holy Text</h2><p>None, although any manual that teaches someone a new fighting technique or improves on an existing technique are considered sacred and are kept in a “library” in the middle of the Forgotten Forest.</p><p> This library is really just many piles of books collected from different planes and realms and every book in the collection deals with some sort of combat.

In the time after the Sun Lord brought the warming of the land, Storjeger led numerous hunts into the forest where they killed many animals. In the bounty that was the land warming, they hadn’t realized that they had over-hunted, leaving the land unbalanced. This led to a lack of game when the land began to cool after the Sun Lord’s death.</p><p>      As the tribe began to dwindle due to lack of food in the harsh winter, Storjeger, as thin as the rest of the tribe, went into the forest alone to find what food he could. After several hours, he spotted a large stag with an impressive rack of horns. Sneaking as close as he dared, his hands trembling from hunger, he threw his javelin. It missed badly, but instead of rushing into the woods, the deer turned and looked at Storjeger.</p><p>    The stag turned and walked slowly into the woods with Storjeger close behind. Following the deer for another hour, Storjeger had been led him to a place in the woods he had never been before. In the distance, he saw a herd of deer that numbered in the dozens with many calves. He prepared his javelin, but the deer he had followed looked at him and then knelt down, laying down its head. It was joined by three does, each kneeling down and offering their necks to Storjeger.</p><p>    Storjeger drew his knife and offering thanks to the deer for their sacrifice, killed the four. He took a few small pieces of meat for himself to sustain him for the trip back. He produced a large sack and bundled the three deer into it and tied the bag to his belt. The stag, he hefted onto his shoulders as a sign of respect.</p><p>     He made the walk back to the Skykosh tribe with tears in his eyes as he knew he could provide for his people. On the trip back, Storjeger realized that his people had to live in balance with the animals of the forest in order to make sure this didn’t happen again. As it was partly his fault that the tribe was in such a predicament, Storjeger was determined to protect the balance of the forest.</p><p>     Upon returning to his tribe, he delivered the deer and explained what had happened and what he had seen and the understanding of the balance. He took the head of the stag and created a mask from it and made a coat from the skin. Without another word, Storjeger walked out of the village and into the realm of the gods, making the name Storjeger synonymous with survival and donning the mantle of God of the Hunt.</p><p>    Storjeger (STOR jay ger) almost always appears as a giant elk but sometimes manifests as a thin warrior of medium height with a stag’s head and horns. He carries several javelin on his back, a longbow made from Yggdrasil, and three arrows, each unique and powerful.</p><p>      Storjeger was originally worshipped only by the @UUID[JournalEntry.QlctNkzE9injOde9.JournalEntryPage.I4CpK8rTs0HgD7hW]{Vikmordere}, but in a very brief period before the @UUID[JournalEntry.QlctNkzE9injOde9.JournalEntryPage.DXD1ygEckY0JIUFB]{Klavekians} went to war with the Vikmordere, there was an exchange of information, including the tale of Storjeger.

More than a physical being, as the insectoids came to dominate the planet of the alien god’s origin, Zagnexis manifested as the congealed consciousness of their dead. While the other intelligent lifeforms on that world fought valiantly, with a deific being directing the racial hive mind of the @UUID[JournalEntry.QlctNkzE9injOde9.JournalEntryPage.SGw7zGFtvjLNPDMY]{hoyrall}, they quickly came to rule over all that the insect god could perceive.</p>\n<p> Until the Great Schism. The progenitors, cast down from their once mythic forms into the lowly race now known as the draaki, made a desperate cry to the cosmos and it was Zagnexis that answered their plea. Mustering the unimaginable power granted from the complete devotion of an entire race of creatures, the insect god transported his entire physical form into Aventyr—Zagn, along with tens of thousands of hoyrall—directly across the universe and into the Dracoprime’s skull, killing the draconic monstrosity instantly.</p>\n<p>    For some generations, Exis continued to direct its children on Aventyr, growing a massive army within the fortress-hives of the hoyrall in preparation for an all-out assault to conquer both the surface and the Underworld. Were it not for the intervention of the colloid during The Confluence, it surely would have succeeded. The other alien entity seized upon Exis conduit to its children, breaking the hive mind of the hoyrall and sending its physical counterpart, Zagn, careening into the oceans of Aventyr to wreck havoc upon everything it meets.</p>\n<p>    Since then, Exis has retained what connections it can to Aventyr, granting powers to its clerics and oracles but little more. The alien god wants nothing more than to expand and procreate, increasing its deific power by generating a second world of followers. Exis is avaricious and without regard for the general balance of natural powers; it will stop at nothing to re-establish its hold over both Zagn and the hoyrall before consuming all of Aventyr.</p>\n<h2>Appearance</h2>\n<p>Exis is a spectral insect composed of dozens of different arthropods, its countless limbs, heads, eyes and antennae constantly morphing into new shapes or variations. Zagn is an enormous, multi-headed (and multi-mouthed) segmented worm with thousands upon thousands of legs that span a body measured by miles.</p>\n<h2>Church of Zagnexis</h2>\n<p>Temples, churches and shrines devoted to the alien god are commonly found throughout the fortress-hives of the hoyrall and honeycombed into Upperworld mountains, but most are in terrible states of disrepair. The unrest following The Confluence led to the dissolution of hoyrall society, and the sites of worship to the god that once bound them all together were quickly targeted by dissenters and never-do-wells. New churches to Zagnexis are well-appointed and carefully kept, tiled with the carapace of insects in exquisite mosaics that depict the journey of the hoyrall.</p>\n<h2>Holy Text</h2>\n<p>There is no written or oral tradition to the worship of Zagnexis; lesser followers are taught the rites of worship through nonverbal communication (through limbs or antennae), and acolytes meld their minds with greater priests in ritual-driven meldings of the minds. Only this devout form of communication is fit for the transmission of the holiest information known to the worshippers of the insect god.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n</div>","markdown":""},"_id":"BgaAYMVXk3L6daU4","image":{},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"sort":2200000,"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"JournalEntry.1nhWSRlTjP4u99gB.JournalEntryPage.vHtchpvGcDlwG7Ja"}}},{"sort":2150000,"name":"Xio","type":"text","_id":"o7Bl7XnxenERvjAq","title":{"show":false,"level":1},"image":{},"text":{"format":1,"content":"<div class=\"aventyr\"><p class=\"s5\">Xio</p><p><strong>Titles:</strong> The Eternal Combatant, Captain of Captains, The Blood Rage</p><p><strong>Home:</strong> Valhalla</p><p><strong>Symbol:</strong> A star crafted from five crossed swords surrounding a bleached skull</p><p><strong>Alignment:</strong> NE</p><p><strong>Portfolio:</strong> Bravery, Combat, War</p><p><strong>Domains:</strong> Destruction, Ferocity, Honor, Strength, War</p><p><strong>Favored Weapon:</strong> Warhammer and handaxe</p><p>Xio is the deity of battle, both honorable and otherwise; he goes wherever there is war or brings it to lands where it is not, ensuring constant and glorious battle.</p><h2>History</h2><p>None truly know when Xio came into existence, but it is said that as long as there has been conflict, he has been amongst those who fight.

Anyone whose business is war is almost unwillingly bound to the Captain of Captains, and his blessing is known to turn the tide of battle on numerous occasions. His clergy are most often those who begin war, or followers that find peace where it exists and start a violent conflict. Most lands find these warmongers to be no better than bandits (worse than most) resulting in an almost world-spanning bounty for Xio’s clergy—a fact which they relish, meeting each new bounty-hunter with zeal and their god’s greatest blessings.</p><h2>Holy Text</h2><p><em>The Business of War</em><br />Though there are strategic insights to be gleaned from these heavy tomes, the business of war is largely about relishing the glory of battle more than how to conduct it.</p><p> </p></div>","markdown":""},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{"core":{"sheetClass":""}}},{"sort":1250000,"name":"The Mother Spirit","type":"text","_id":"7JZLaCukpLMqn2R2","title":{"show":true,"level":1},"image":{},"text":{"format":1,"content":"<div class=\"aventyr\"><p class=\"s5\">The Mother Spirit</p><p><strong>Titles:</strong> The Great Mother, Leaf Gatherer, Four Heart</p><p><strong>Home:</strong> A nexus of the elemental planes of Air, Earth, Fire and Water</p><p><strong>Alignment:</strong> Neutral Good</p><p><strong>Portfolio:</strong> nature, creation, family</p><p><strong>Worshippers:</strong> @UUID[JournalEntry.QlctNkzE9injOde9.JournalEntryPage.myrc4omqUaiD3RKZ]{Halfling}and fey of @UUID[JournalEntry.PCe82J4UbHQWFYYL]{Picollo}, and those who believe in the Four Winds theory of creation.</p><p><strong>Domains:</strong> Air, Community, Earth, Fire and Water</p><p><strong>Subdomains:</strong> Family, Metal, Wind, Oceans</p><p><strong>Favored Weapon:</strong> Unarmed strike</p><h2>History</h2><p>Worshipers of the Mother Spirit believe that when the elements came together to form the world, a vessel was required to prevent disastrous interaction between opposed elements. The Mother Spirit gathered the elements into her four-chambered heart to allow them to work in community to craft the world.</p><h2>Appearance</h2><p>The Mother Spirit most often appears as a halfling woman with fey or otherworldy features. She wears a homespun brown robe woven with simple leaf patterns. Her hair is that of autumn leaves, tinged with flame. The presence of the other three elements can be found in her ever present tears of alternating joy and sadness, the comforting breath of her voice, and the adamantine sheen of her forearms and hands.</p><h2>Church of The Great Mother</h2><p>Although worshipped primarily in @UUID[JournalEntry.PCe82J4UbHQWFYYL]{Picollo}, knowledge of the Great Mother has been brought to other areas of Aventyr by halflings displaced by the Great Schism, or fey wandering throughout the lands as their whimsy takes them.</p><h2>Worshippers and Clergy</h2><p>Priests usually dress in homespun robes and go about unarmed. Clerics of the Great Mother must select the community domain (or family subdomain) as one of their domains, but may select any of the elemental domains or subdomains as their second. The prestige class, devotee of the Four Hearts, grants access to additional elemental domains.</p><p>Clerics with the separatist archetype can often be found. The Great Mother recognizes that there are many paths to community, and loves these “Fallen Leaves” as much as any other worshipper, hoping they will one day embrace community as a tenet of faith.</p><h3>Fallen Leaf cleric</h3><p>Fallen Leaves are clerics of the Mother Spirit Mastering the divine nature of dual elements requires further study, available only to the Devotee of the Four Hearts.</p><h3>Devotee of the Four Hearts</h3><p>Devotees of the Four Hearts are worshipers of the Mother Spirit who seek to understand more fully the act of creation initiated by the joining of all four of the elements through a deeper examination of the elements themselves. As their understanding increases, they add additional domains to their repertoire of gifts from the goddess.</p><p><strong>Role:</strong> A Devotee of the Four Hearts is more prepared to deal with elemental challenges than her less erudite brothers and sisters. Because the theological study of the elements is deeply intertwined with the nature of the goddess, the scaling of the holy abilities of these priests are less impacted with a diversion into a prestige class.</p><p><strong>Alignment:</strong> Most members of this prestige class tend to be neutral or neutral good to better understand the balance required in bringing together the elements. Lawful clerics embrace the discipline of safeguarding the elements and the world around them while those elements join in community, whereas chaotic priests embrace the messiness of creation.</p><h2>Holy Text: The Tree of Community</h2><p>Temples to the goddess are centered around a great tree which forms the center of the complex, regardless of its architectural style (or design of the grove in cases of a fey temple). The leaves of the tree contain the holy writings of the Mother, as well as the stories of her worshippers, unnumbered as the leaves themselves. Divination and prophetic magic is often tied to, or enhanced by, the tree of community; to read one’s leaf is to gain insight to one’s soul.</p><p></p><p></p></div>","markdown":""},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}},{"sort":1950000,"name":"Qathindli","type":"text","_id":"jjNtg5QMfe2uI6uS","title":{"show":false,"level":1},"image":{},"text":{"format":1,"content":"<div class=\"aventyr\"><p class=\"s5\">Qathindli</p><p><strong>Titles:</strong> The Monkey Primeval, The Unsullied</p><p><strong>Home:</strong> @UUID[JournalEntry.dHHrcptCELfN05gb.JournalEntryPage.eOVkEXkbiSWbkVcp#treeland]{Treeland}</p><p><strong>Alignment:</strong> Chaotic Neutral</p><p><strong>Symbol:</strong> A monkey face with a painted boomerang for a smiling mouth (only used by humans)</p><p><strong>Portfolio:</strong> Nature, Primates, Wilderness</p><p><strong>Worshippers:</strong> Monkeys and disparate or relocated people from the @UUID[JournalEntry.g4odaMsHbRkeNFhn]{Vast Swamp} or the @UUID[JournalEntry.dHHrcptCELfN05gb]{Yerek Steppes}</p><p><strong>Domains:</strong> Animal, Chaos, Plant, Protection</p><p><strong>Favored Weapon:</strong> Boomerang</p><p></p><p>Two hundred years ago, Mentane Flamebearer, a human cleric of a best-forgotten god, and Golar, his half-orc monk bodyguard landed on the eastern shore of what would become @UUID[JournalEntry.dHHrcptCELfN05gb.JournalEntryPage.eOVkEXkbiSWbkVcp#treeland]{Treeland}. The reason for the visit was that Mentane thought he had found a way to become a god. His hypothesis was that if he could instill the magical essences that he acquired daily into the same place for a long period of time, then the release of that pent up energy into himself would push him past the boundary of mortality and into the realm of godhood. Mentane chose a small fuzzy fruit with a green interior, called a forhoral, which grew on a vine as his receptacle of power.</p><p>As they settled on the eastern edge of the forest Golar began to notice the large numbers of primates in the forest. Ignoring them, Mentane had Golar find a piece of wood to allow the vines of the fruit grow upward.</p><p>For the next year, every morning, Mentane would slowly and carefully direct his magical energies into the seed that he had planted. Golar, not being needed, wandered the forest. Some of the primates took interest in the two for a while, but seeing that they were no immediate threat, they were content to ignore the two.</p><p>After about a month, one small chimpanzee began following the Golar as he explored what would become known as Treeland. He began to call her “Qathindli,” which translated roughly to “small one” in his local Orcish dialect. He would call and wave to her every morning and she would chatter back at him.</p><p>Something surprising that Golar noticed was that Qathindli would watch him when he went through his morning exercises. She would sit on a branch and stare at him while he moved in slow, deliberate patterns. She had taken a special liking to his three-bladed boomerang. When she wasn’t watching him practice, he would almost always find her at his pack, holding the throwing weapon. Eventually, he carved her her own two-bladed boomerang and placed a leather strap around the two ends. She took it with her everywhere.</p><p>As the year progressed, Mentane’s fruit began to grow, becoming larger than usual for this type of fruit. The vine grew quickly up the post and one year to the day of its planting, Mentane emerged from his tent, ready to become a god.</p><p>His forhoral fruit was gone. In its place, he found Qathindli sitting on the forest floor, holding the remains of the forhoral fruit.</p><p>She sat and stared, her monkey mind not comprehending what was happening to her.</p><p>Mentane began ranting and raving about the amount of effort he put into the project and his loss to a monkey. In his rage, he was preparing to utterly destroy Qathindli when she turned her head toward him and shocked both he and Golar.</p><p>“What is happening to me?” she asked loudly and haltingly.</p><p>All three stared at each other for a moment before Qathindli screeched and ran off into the forest.</p><p>A few days later, Mentane packed up his belongings and stowed them on the boat. He was going to make his way back to the @UUID[JournalEntry.QVrlu0lTv2vFtT5P]{Klavek Kingdom}. Golar said that he was going to stay in the forest for the time being. They bade each other farewell and Golar watched Mentane sail off into the sunrise.</p><p>Golar found Qathindli her near her tribe of monkeys. She was speaking quickly and erratically, words from every language spilling out of her mouth. Golar understood words from a few languages and recognized several more. The other monkeys were frightened of her.</p><p>Using food, Golar tempted Qathindli out of her tree and through a long and arduous process, explained what Mentane had done with the forhoral fruit and that his best guess was that when she had eaten the fruit, she had absorbed all of the magical power invested in it and that she had become more than a monkey.</p><p>Over the course of the next six months, Golar taught Qathindli control thanks to his martial training. While she did learn how to focus her newly found thoughts, she was still a monkey inside. Her train of thought often derailed into a conglomeration of words from different languages, which made it difficult for Golar to understand.</p><p>The change in her standing among the primates came when, as she and Golar were training in a small clearing, a wild boar broke through the undergrowth and charged at Golar. Though the battle was brief, it was also incredibly violent. In the end, the boar lay dead and Golar had numerous cuts and slashes from the boar’s wicked tusks. Qathindli rushed out from her hiding place and chattered at Golar in numerous languages as he started to succumb to his injuries. As he tumbled to the ground, Qathindli placed her hands on him and with a visible light, poured healing energy into Golar.</p><p>The forest around the two of them went silent as the watchful monkeys around them looked on and saw the power that Qathindli now possessed.</p><p>While she may not have been a demigoddess in the classical sense, Qathindli has eclipsed monkeyhood and is something more. She had decided to be the protector of Treeland, which she named herself. When she accepted that mantle, she became a demigoddess.</p><h2>Appearance</h2><p>Qathindli can change her appearance to that of any primate in existence, except human. Her preferred form is a pygmy monkey that stands roughly six inches tall, with bright red hair. This form seems to cause less violent reactions in those that she speaks with than one of her larger shapes.</p><p>Each of her forms has a face that is like the race she is interacting with than it is monkey-like.</p><h2>Church</h2><p>Even though she doesn’t understand it, the humans that live in @UUID[JournalEntry.dHHrcptCELfN05gb.JournalEntryPage.eOVkEXkbiSWbkVcp#treeland]{Treeland} worship Qathindli. The services are held outside usually around midday, but it varies due to the weather.</p><p>The leader of the humans, Damon, teaches that the people of his tribe should live like the monkeys: in harmony with nature. Because of his worship, Qathindli grants him spells, even if she doesn’t know how she does that.</p><h2>Worshippers &amp; Clergy</h2><p>Qathindi’s worshippers are all of the humans that live in Treeland, under the guidance of her only clergy member, @UUID[JournalEntry.dHHrcptCELfN05gb.JournalEntryPage.Tc1kTiX3bvQt4Jd7#damon]{Damon}. One of the titles Damon has given Qathindli is “The Unsullied.” He believes that she is holy because she has never been human, and therefore is above us and unsullied by her nature.</p><h2>Holy Text</h2><p>Qathindli has no holy text to speak of. As her knowledge of language grows, she has had Golar and Damon try to teach her how to write. The two main problems are that monkey hands are not designed for holding human writing utensils and Qathindli still has the mind of a monkey, so any given sentence contains multiple languages and bad translations, making them impossible to read. Damon still collects these “writings” and keeps them safe.</p></div>","markdown":""},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}}],"_stats":{"systemId":"dnd5e","systemVersion":"2.1.4","coreVersion":"10.291","createdTime":1662054505131,"modifiedTime":1675613756888,"lastModifiedBy":"EsIYTtNnjwxUbKOG"},"ownership":{"default":0,"R5IsvMTH5P79pBoG":3},"folder":"j9cXBagzZ1ARsO2I","sort":1000000},{"_id":"QVrlu0lTv2vFtT5P","name":"Klavek Kingdom","flags":{"monks-enhanced-journal":{"scrollPos":"{\".description\":0}","_lasttab":"description"},"core":{"sourceId":"Compendium.world.deities-of-aventyr.0FSVjV3WkdoAk7OX","viewMode":1},"scene-packer":{"hash":"af13afab06a078eaa241594be40fd382a54bd348"},"cf":{"id":null}},"pages":[{"name":"Klavek Kingdom","type":"text","title":{"show":false,"level":1},"text":{"format":1,"content":"<div class=\"aventyr\"><img style=\"display:block;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto\" src=\"modules/aaw-games-aventyr/Setting-images/Klavek-Kingdom-map-750x616.webp\" width=\"483\" height=\"445\" /></div>\n<div class=\"aventyr\"> </div>\n<div class=\"aventyr\"><img style=\"float:right;margin:0px 15px 15px 0px;border:0px\" title src=\"modules/aaw-games-aventyr/Setting-images/Mohkba-Royal-Guard-small.webp\" width=\"192\" height=\"383\" />\n<p>Sometimes referred to as the Klavek Homeland by its citizens, the Klavek Kingdom hosts the most powerful military in the known world.</p>\n<p>    The Klavek Kingdom is ruled by King Tokolvor XIII, a tyrannical leader and military genius.

The early @UUID[JournalEntry.QlctNkzE9injOde9.JournalEntryPage.DXD1ygEckY0JIUFB]{Klavekians} had spread from the borders of the elven woods toward the sea and built the first realms there before that time. But since almost everything built near the sea had been destroyed by the beast, the great evacuation that followed started a new age.</p>\n<img style=\"display:block;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto\" src=\"modules/aaw-games-aventyr/Setting-images/octopus-clip-art-2-640x413.jpg\" width=\"477\" height=\"354\" />\n<p>Immunity from attack, so rare in those days, caused the eastward movement of human colonization to become reversed. That is to say, settlers began to flow back from the old-established but now ravaged colonies of the Eastern Sea to the unoccupied lands near the Serpent Tail river. This constituted the first condition which, arising out of the geographical position of Mohkba, contributed to the successful settlement of the Mohkba region. Another condition which contributed to the growth of the Principality was the fact that Mohkba stood upon a river which had always – even from the most ancient times – been possessed of great commercial importance, a waterway connecting Central Klavek with the @UUID[JournalEntry.ismpCNWpGHvB1iPw.JournalEntryPage.Erya8w29cRTTJELu]{Serpent Lake} and its untouched resources. Of course these lucky years were way before the @UUID[JournalEntry.QlctNkzE9injOde9.JournalEntryPage.I4CpK8rTs0HgD7hW]{Vikmordere} discovered there was something worth raiding on the Serpent Tail river. The third factor was that said river was not connected to the eastern ocean and thus safe from the kraken.</p>\n<img style=\"display:block;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto\" src=\"modules/aaw-games-aventyr/Setting-images/Settlement-of-Mohkba-640x480.jpg\" width=\"449\" height=\"387\" />\n<p>Yuri Dvagaslov thus made Mohkba the point where two great popular movements intersected one another – namely, a movement of colonization northeastwards along the Serpent Tail river and a movement of commerce back southeastwards toward the sea once the kraken was sleeping again. The city’s geographical position conferred great economic advantages upon the early Princes of Klavek. A large population attracted to their appanage meant a large number of direct taxpayers, while the movement of a large volume of commercial traffic on the Serpent Tail river before the Vikmordere Wars meant a stimulation of popular industry in his dominions and a large flow of transit-dues into his treasury.</p>\n<p>The physical network of rivers leading toward the lake is first of all a transportation network. The early klavekians traveled the rivers and lake by boats in summer and with sleds over the ice in winter. But the river network supported social interaction. Trading of amber, honey and furs produced economic networks. Marriage alliances and divine exchanges both produced and strengthened social networks. And the frequent interaction permitted the klavekian language to spread and become so dominant over a wide area that it is now known simply as ‘common’.</p>\n<h2>Mohkba today</h2>\n<p>Mohkba has lots of quiet cozy lanes, wooden houses, an incredible number of monasteries and churches, and delicious pickles are on sale on every corner. The capital of Klavek is known for its great towers, most belonging to churches, but others to the nobility or to wizards. When alliances are forged due to marriages, illusions of bridges adorned with shared banners connect the towers, creating an ever changing scenery. Mohkba is composed out of eight quarters. Nobility and commoners share all Quarters, except for the vast @UUID[.LGCNFtJ4cWlq0HjE#gardeners-quarter]{Gardener’s quarter} where but a handful of druids live, the @UUID[.LGCNFtJ4cWlq0HjE#arcane-quarter]{Fortress of Arcane Arts }which is reserved for Magicians and Alchemists and assumed to be a dangerous place anyhow, and the small @UUID[.LGCNFtJ4cWlq0HjE#kings-fortress]{King’s quarter} where only royalty has their homes.

It was built so long ago that there are no written evidences, which had led to speculations about it being placed there by the gods themselves. Be this as it may, the powerful monolithic massive structure of the monument still dominates not only the divine quarter, but the whole historic center of @UUID[.dwAJ5Jtc6ii8zQoh]{Mohkba}. The basis of its complex three-dimensional architecture is a four-domed, five-columned brick temple of the cross-and-cupola type with a high ground floor. It is built of brick and blue stone, and its blind arcades give it a special beauty and nobility. In the interior of this palladion a faithfuls attention is drawn by the unique historically formed iconostases icons. These are ancient mural paintings, national relics of Klavek that include the famous icon of Yuri Dvagaslov himself, the Holy Knight of the Crossroad. In the course of hundreds of years the Sophianeum was a center of the clerical, political and cultural life of ancient Mohkba.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<img style=\"float:right;margin:0px 15px 15px 0px;border:0px\" src=\"modules/aaw-games-aventyr/Setting-images/085-Cathedral-Tower-from-St-Johns-Street.jpg\" width=\"237\" height=\"316\" />\n<p>     Next to the Sophianeum is Alvarov’s Monastery that was founded by Prince Yaroslav the Witch as early as in the first century after the foundation of Mohkba, as a legend reads, and one cannot help being amazed by the striking beauty of another masterpiece of ancient Klavekian architecture. Many experts of Klavekian art justly believe Mohkba to be blessed by the Gods; no other old Klavekian cities have managed to preserve so many ancient architectural monuments adorned with wall murals. Visitors will see that with their own eyes visiting the churches of the Oreadean Gods on Vlassov Lake, appreciating at its true worth the old frescoes of world-famous Wulfgarin the Dwarf in the Church of the Enchantments on Vassili Street; singularly graceful murals in the Church of the Spirit of Bertramov on Prideful Field, admiring the beautiful clerical wall calendar of the Church of the Nameless Hero and studying wonderful mural compositions in The Sinless Cathedral. The later is also famous for its five-tier iconostasis with icons from up to four centuries ago.</p>\n<p>More mundane, but still very important are the Tower of the Inquisition and the Tower of the Order of the Elk, the latter the chivalric arm of the former and thus connected by a real bridge, one of the oldest non-illusionary bridges connecting Mohkba’s towers.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h3>Armour of Frozen Tears</h3>\n<p>When the @UUID[JournalEntry.QlctNkzE9injOde9.JournalEntryPage.I4CpK8rTs0HgD7hW]{Vikmordere} attacked @UUID[.dwAJ5Jtc6ii8zQoh]{Mohkba} in the old days, legend says that the face of Tsar Alexei VI was awash in tears of wrath, and that it was so cold during that attack that his tears freeze before hitting the ground. Those frozen tears were collected by a dwarven cleric and with the aid of an unknown smith forged into an armour of sparkling brilliance. Tsar Alexei himself wore the armour in the counterattack, when he charged the enemy at the front of his soldiers, and the vile Vikmordere magic dissipated into waterdrops while hitting the tsar, unable to harm him. While most of this tale seems to be a legend, the armour indeed does exist, and the tsars do wear it on the days of their coronation since the days of Tsar Gregory VI, twin brother and successor of Alexei. The armour is clearly magical, since it adjusts to the size of the monarch and even fitted Tsarina Anna’s very womanly body when her coronation came.</p>\n<p>The Armour of Frozen Tears is sky blue in colour, and in form unlike any other armour, though it somewhat resembles a flowing plate mail. The is no crest on the armour, nor any other sign, and, contradicting a then common legend, it can be worn by anyone, as was obvious after Mikhael the jester put it on during a festival. The armour also doesn’t prevent its wearer from being beheaded, which was also proven by said jester and the bodyguard of the enraged tsar. ‘To put on the frozen tears’ is now a common proverb for a daunting deed that went horribly wrong.</p>\n<p>The Armour of Frozen Tears is kept in the @UUID[.LGCNFtJ4cWlq0HjE#divine-quarter]{Sophianeum} and on display there, constantly guarded by a watch of honour.</p>\n<h3>The Tombstone of Bojar Pjotr</h3>\n<p>The Tombstone of Bojar Pjotr, build from marble and engraved with silver letters, describes the birth- and death-days of the Bojar Pjotr, who was known for his racial tolerance, and his bride, an unnamed Othyugh, who ate him at their wedding ceremony before being killed by the guests. Since that day the tombstone is used to promote racial purism, to be an outstanding example of foolish behaviour, to always come armed to a wedding and for lots of other more or less sensible things. But over the years the jokes gradually went sour, for even as Pjotr didn’t leave any relatives, the tombstone is always polished, and fresh flowers do appear next to it on the day of his birth, the day of both deaths and on a third day, which is supposed to be the birthing day of the proud bride. In later years a small fence was build around the tombstone, and now lovers faced with huge obstacles throw a flower inside the fenced area, where they lie fresh long after that should be possible, only to vanish without trace when another flower is thrown inside. It is known that the burden of the lovers is eased in some minor way as long as their flower is inside the fence, and that each pair of lovers may only throw one flower for this boon. Should there be no major obstacle to the love, or a second flower be thrown, then their flower withers away immediately, without replacing the last one, and bad luck is guaranteed for a month and a day. It also seems to matter what flower is chosen, a rose having other effects than a lily for instance, but that may be coincidence. Nonetheless there have been desperate lovers who went searching for a @UUID[JournalEntry.ismpCNWpGHvB1iPw.JournalEntryPage.w79VOo3UeUGraouv#winterflower]{Winterflower}, a rare wildflower supposed to grow in the northern mountains near the outpost of @UUID[JournalEntry.ismpCNWpGHvB1iPw]{Rybalka}, to better their chances for success.</p>\n<h3>Cold Iron Gate</h3>\n<p>The Cold Iron Gate is the impressive relict of a great effort to defeat the @UUID[JournalEntry.QlctNkzE9injOde9.JournalEntryPage.ei36LjIhEoh87vgE]{elves} and their fey allies once and for all. There is much disagreement about the details of the plan, but most sages agree that all walls and gates of @UUID[.dwAJ5Jtc6ii8zQoh]{Mohkba} were planned to be coated in cold iron. There are many different opinions about details though, if every town of the realm was to be coated in cold iron, and if the cold iron was meant to hold the fey outside or trap them inside instead. There is even a discussion if the elves themselves were hampered by cold iron in those ancient days, since they clearly aren’t in modern times. Whatever it is, after one gate was ready the whole plan was stopped due to lack of money. In modern days the Gate is infamous on the one hand, leading to the proverb of ‘he even has a cold iron toilet’ for someone with too much money, but oddly something of pride also, for it was a very ambitious project to say the least, and even unfinished its a symbol for Mohkba aiming very high. The Cold Iron Gate itself is somewhat barren, there are no gravels, signs or whatever in it, and has a dull blue colour that has appeared over time, since old texts describe the gate as being the colour of a grey stormcloud. Watchmen tell that the Cold Iron Gate is easier to close and to open then other gates of equal size. No invader has ever tried to break this gate down, so the ultimate test for the defensive attributes has not happened yet.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>Arcane Quarter</h2>\n<p> </p>\n<img style=\"float:right;margin:0px 15px 15px 0px;border:0px\" src=\"modules/aaw-games-aventyr/Setting-images/Wizard-with-Golem.webp\" width=\"252\" height=\"346\" />\n<p>The Arcane quarter is the only part of Mohkba without religious buildings. Not contend with lonely wizardly towers, the arcane wielders of Mohkba combined their resources to build the emerald fortress in the then Arcane suburb, now known as the somewhat infamous Fortress of the Arcane Arts. This fortress was mentioned in chronicles as early as five years after the foundation of the Sophianeum. The present walls and towers were constructed in a single night 200 years later. The central building of the emerald fortress is the four-domed college of Mutamateria, nicknamed ‘Transformation Cathedral’ to the chargrin of the clerics. The walls of the college are separated by pilasters with zakomari that were adorned with painting as far back as the 4th century after its foundation. The pinnacle of architecture when it was erected has a grandiose size and sensational shape, with eight cupolas, one for each school of magic, dazzling with luxury and an abundance of tiles, brick patterns and frescos. It is a real encyclopedia of arcane scenes which has no equivalent in Klavekian art. Today it is also connected with, or somewhat has overgrown, the Alchemists College, with is now part of the emerald fortress.</p>\n<h2>King’s Fortress</h2>\n<img style=\"float:right;margin:0px 15px 15px 0px;border:0px\" src=\"modules/aaw-games-aventyr/Setting-images/elizabethan-costumes-3.jpg\" width=\"270\" height=\"288\" />\n<p>The King’s Fortress was closely related to all the most important events in the life of ancient Mohkba: hosting foreign embassies, seeing-off warriors to fight the enemy, convening meetings of the Crown’s Advisors. Many centuries ago, the whole fortress was surrounded by ramparts, on which stood strong log walls and fortress towers. They served as reliable protection during the internecine wars of the Klavekian princes, but were later burned by Vikmordere invaders. Today, in a much safer age, nothing but a high wall remains.</p>\n<p>In addition to the above-mentioned Sophianeum, the King’s Fortress also features other striking monuments as the Faceted Palace – a rare specimen of elven architecture, built in the times of Vassily Elf-Friend jointly with elven masters, as well as the impressive and beautiful bellfry with a set of adamantit bells. In the central square of the King’s Fortress stands the monument “The Millenium of Klavek”, designed by Quincov the Stout and erected a bit prematurely 940 years after the foundation of Klavek by Tsar Alexei the Impatient. This unique document in bronze immortalizes all those who greatly contributed to the development of the country: its culture, science, art and literature, but also its tsars and war-heroes. The klavekian special political structure, spiritual freedom and territorial independence were highly favorable to the evolution of culture and art, and this is justly celebrated in the political heart of Klavek. Mohkba is one of the greatest art centers of the human world. Its architectural traditions, skaldic tales, school of icon-painting, jeweler’s and decorative applied art became famous all over the known world. Mohkba also is Klavekia’s major center of literacy and book production. As far back as the foundation years, by the will of the great Prince Yuri Dvagaslov himself, Mohkba saw the first school to train three hundred children at a time.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h3>The Emerald Casket</h3>\n<p>Once only known to a selected few trusted advisors of the Tsar, @UUID[.LGCNFtJ4cWlq0HjE#the-bridge-that-is-there-and-not-there]{ The Bridge That Is There And Not} There is supposed to be not the only legacy of Grigory Rivalnov. During the Time of Troubles a group of mercenaries took hold of the @UUID[.LGCNFtJ4cWlq0HjE#kings-fortress]{King’s Fortress} for a short time, and from these originated what is now a common legend. Deep under the King’s Fortress there’s an emerald casket, presumably holding the last of the Sinner Tsars in suspension, until a time where the lineage of Tsars is broken. There are some facts contradicting this tale, as the lineage of Tsars has been broken a few times in the past (most famously after the death of Tsarina Anna in 1143) and suspension doesn’t sound like illusionist magic, but still the legend persists. The Casket itself is rumored to be a huge emerald, hence the name, with a vague ageless male human shape enclosed in it. While nobody reliable has set her eyes on the casket in recent decades and talked about it, there are nonetheless many works of art depicting it in the city, even one monument in @UUID[.LGCNFtJ4cWlq0HjE#mariners-quarter]{Mariner’s Quarter}. Those works vary in many details from each other though, and there are ongoing and somewhat heated discussions which one looks more like the famous original.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>Trade-yard</h2>\n<p>On the opposite bank of the river, reachable by a footbridge, is Beatricov’s Court and the ancient Trade-yard, displaying many still-standing monuments of the early days of Klavek, all reminiscent of the busy trade life of Mohkba in the days before the Vikmordere Wars. Originally made of wood, it was almost completely destroyed by fire. Later new walls with defensive towers were erected. Not surprisingly, the symbol of the Trade-yard is a stone fortress, surrounded by an even more ancient earthen wall.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<img style=\"float:right;margin:0px 15px 15px 0px;border:0px\" src=\"modules/aaw-games-aventyr/Setting-images/237-The-Butcher-Newport-Market-Alley.jpg\" width=\"258\" height=\"233\" />\n<p>Nearly every house in the Trade-yard has a unique history and the central part of the quarter is one big architectural complex. The Beatricovan trading gallery is one of the biggest complexes in Klavekia. The layout is based on the plan of a typical merchant’s shop with trading on the ground floor and storage rooms in the attic and cellar. Rumors place the home of Klavek’s Thieves Guild here, but surely the Tsar’s Inquisitors would have ferreted this out long ago if there was any truth to the rumor.</p>\n<p>The most famous monument of the Trade-yard certainly is the Cube of Names for the most famous warrior-heroes of the first days of Mohkba, the greatest clerics, summoners, magi and oracles. The lower side on which the cube rests is supposed to show the names of rogues, the tsar’s under-hand, hidden even in the present. In the Trade-yard the ancient contracts are still stored, including such world-famous items as a great number of birch-bark scrolls and lead seals dating back to the founding years. These are indicative of a unique and striking level of literacy among ancient klavekians who were certainly and contrary to elven prejudices no barbarians at all and had a highly organized system of state control from the beginning.</p>\n<h3>The Hundred Candle Steps</h3>\n<p>When Yevgeni VI. married the elven lady Arianna Greenleaf in 692 his bride did make a grand entrance into @UUID[.dwAJ5Jtc6ii8zQoh]{Mohkba}. The last hundred steps of hers before she kissed the Tsar for the first time left footprints on the street, and immediatly after her delicate feet left the street a single cobblestone in each footprint went into tiny flames. Those flames still burn, a small but bright yellow light, unless @UUID[.ulLkhApELbg08M4o]{Klavek} is at war with the elves, when the flames change colour to blue.</p>\n<p>The flames may be extinguished easily, but they reflame on their own after a few minutes. They are unaffected by normal wind. The street were they are located is the street of the candlemakers and other trades who can use the handy open flames for their trade. It is one of the few tolerated displays of magic in the town since a rampaging troll could be stopped with help of these flames many years ago.</p>\n<h3>The Grand Scales</h3>\n<p>The @UUID[.LGCNFtJ4cWlq0HjE#trade-yard]{Trade-yard} has seen its share of good trades and bad trades, but also of frauds and con artists. Tsar Ironhand has had enough of that one day after his custom officers were cheated on a stormy night with a wooden block coated in gold and he commissioned the building of the Grand Scale, which is the height of a small building and able to weigh up to two tons of raw material. Its difficult and time consuming to handle, but very accurate and gives a +2 to appraise checks for raw materials. Rumours say that both the con artist and the custom officers are all part of the scale now, having been turned into the construction by magic or melted together with the iron from which is was built. In stormy nights they are rumoured to still wail for the tsars mercy.</p>\n<h2>Carpenter’s Quarter</h2>\n<p>Like every other separated part of Mohkba Carpenter’s Quarter has its own wall. The main gate connecting Carpenter’s quarter to the King’s Fortress has a famous décor on the outside, comprising three monumental tile compositions: To the right of the southern portal is a round bas-relief depicting Prince Yaroslav the Witch and under the arches of the side facades are two scenes of workers laboring. These unique ancient Klavekian tiles date back to first century after the foundation.</p>\n<p>The other way into this quarter is Nikolsky Gate. Behind it is the small “bridge of happiness,” hung with padlocks. At the edges of the bridge are two horseshoes of a centaur, one of which reads: “Eternal Love” in the language of the horsefolk. Holding hands, lovers go through the large horseshoe and walk on the eight small ones on the bridge. According to legend, a female centaur ambassador broke its horseshoe here on a stone, being dazzled by the sight of a Klavekian cavalry officer. To this day the “stone of desires” sits close to the bridge.</p>\n<p>Despite its name, Carpenter’s quarter has long been famous for its furriers and shoemakers. On the streets are a lot of wooden houses, stone mansion from the end of the century before last, as well as trading arcades new and preserved.</p>\n<p>Carpenter’s quarter is also known for its Abandoned Monastry, a building which stands empty for about 300 years now. Here False Yuri II (Grishka Raulyev) met the nun Tatyana, the widow of Alexei IV, Maria Poterowa, who had entered the monastery. She recognized the pretender as her son, Yuri. This was the trigger for the Troubles, an euphemistic name for one of the meanest of the Klavekian civil wars. Due to that sad part of Klavekian history the monastery is empty now, but still a fantastic sight. In the old days, in the minds of the people, the greatness of a monastery was always connected to the height of its belltower. The architectural center of the Carpenter’s Quarter is one of the highest belltowers in Klavekia, more than 89 meters high. Monumental and steadfast, it does not look overly heavy because of its many columns, wide arched openings and decoration, which contains Alexei’s monograms. The dome of the seven-storied belltower is decorated with the imperial crown – the monastry had always been under the special patronage of the tsars. On the orders of Metropolitan Vladimir, 8 bells were cast for it, including “The Bear”, the largest bell in Mohkba. Each has its own tone, but all together they allow the ringer to create a perfect harmonic composition, a gem of world cultural heritage, the Mohkba chimes. When the angels first heard it legend claimed they cried, creating the lake of Mohkba. Since the Troubles the bells are silent and refuse to ring, a sign that toppled the claim of false Yuri II more than anything else. Countless priests and magicians have tried to revive the chime since those days to no avail. Standing near “The Bear” they could only enjoy the stunning views of the river and the Bridge of Happiness across it.</p>\n<p>The boundless forests outside Mohkba behind the bridge are equally beautiful in summer as in winter, in morning as in evening. Mohkba and Mohkba region have long been intensely cultivated by man, perhaps more than any other region of Klavekia. Yet nature still occupies a huge part of it with clean lakes and rivers, and wild forests. It is hard to believe, but today forests still cover a huge part of Mohkba region, and with some luck one can still see wild animals looking from the belltower. One should take care though, the monastry is neglected and the stairs are somewhat unsafe.</p>\n<h3>The Bridge That Is There And Not There</h3>\n<p>Grigorij Rivalnov was the greatest Illusionist Mohkba has known in its long history, living in the days of the Sinner Tsars. It is told that once, at the 25th birthday of Tsar Anatol V., he changed the whole capital so that it looked like covered in molted gold, sparkling in the sunrise. Another story is not that beautiful, telling a tale where the Illusionist came to the Tsarina in the night disguised by foul magic to resemble the Tsar. Whether that tale is true or not, it was used against the Tsarevitch during the civil war after the death of Anatol V., claiming the young prince to be a wizard’s bastard. It was one of the many reasons why magic is so distrusted in Klavek up to the present time.</p>\n<p>Be the stories true or false, most of Rivalnov’s illusion have been banned or timed out over the long years since his death, save for the famous Bridge That Is There And Not There, or Rivalnov’s Bridge. It looks like a sturdy stone bridge, including small statues of famous citizens of Mohkba from the time where it was cast, most prominent among them the tsar and tsarina (but not the tsarevitch) in the middle of it. The bridge is famous enough that most people of Klavek know its an illusion, but nonetheless whoever attemps to cross it for the first time has to make a will save. If she fails, she is able to cross it for the rest of her life, even inside a carriage if every other passenger and the horses failed also. If she succeeds, she falls straight through the illusion and most likely takes a cold bath in the river. Most citizens of Mohkba are able to cross the bridge freely, having failed their save as children when they still believed in wonders.</p>\n<p>Of course its a common prank among teenagers to guide foreigners over the bridge, telling them about the illusion while doing so and laughing the moment the strangers take a bath.</p>\n<h3>The Unprotected Ruby</h3>\n<p>On a plaza in the midst of @UUID[.LGCNFtJ4cWlq0HjE#carpenters-quarter]{Carpenter’s Quarter} is an ebony pedestal with a flawless fist-sized red ruby on it. It is not protected by any means, and in fact has been stolen four times already, but always was returned in a week at most. It is obviously worth a fortune, should someone find a buyer for it, but doing that is the difficult part. Tied to the ruby is bad luck of the gravest sort, so most who did ever handle it for more than a few hours died horribly, and no one has managed to break that curse, if it is a curse at all. If the gem is returned to the pedestal all is well again, save for some scars, wounds or broken bones from the time of possessing the gem, but no unusual bad luck happens again. Sages have wondered about the properties of the Unprotected Ruby for long, and examined it – usually from afar – but no one knows its secret. Legend claims one tsar or another, the details vary, paid tribute to the @UUID[JournalEntry.QlctNkzE9injOde9.JournalEntryPage.I4CpK8rTs0HgD7hW]{Vikmordere} with this specially prepared gem, to weaken the enemy by cursing their leaders, but the gem had been returned after some time or never delivered at all after killing its maker in a weird accident which centered around a goose, a flower and a nail.</p>\n<h3>Watching Torches</h3>\n<p>In the Street of the Eye, where once the royal treasury was located, is one of the few magical features of Mohkba of the divine nature. Dating back to the years of Pjotr the Pius in ancient times the Grand Robbery of the treasury shook @UUID[.dwAJ5Jtc6ii8zQoh]{Mohkba} to the core. Pjotr did pray to the Guardian God for help against further occurences of this kind, and some claim that he could do not much else but pray after being poor like a goblin thanks to the thieves. Be this as it may, the street once leading to the treasury has magical torches to this day. They catch fire the moment an intelligent creature comes in 40 feet of them, and they sputter out with no one in the vicinity any longer. It was a very efficient warning system until the Second Great Robbery of the treasury which was committed with the help of golems. After the @UUID[JournalEntry.QlctNkzE9injOde9.JournalEntryPage.I4CpK8rTs0HgD7hW]{Vikmordere} plundered the treasury twice, each time illuminated by torchlight, it was relocated to a more secure location, and today wonderworkers, con artists and charlatans have their shops in the torchlit street, to the chargrin of many clerics. They sell everything, from splinters of the true bowl that graced the Empty Pedestal once, enough of them to build a glass dome over @UUID[.dwAJ5Jtc6ii8zQoh]{Mohkba} as the critics claim, to bones of the Sinner Tsars or the head of the Vikmordere chieftain Angus the Old from the days when he was still a child. Sometimes true magic can be found here, so its a place visited by many for its sense of wonder and promises.</p>\n<h3>The Floating Tower</h3>\n<p>When Klavek was young and mostly build of wood two rival families had a feud with each other that slowly escalated. One night the tower of one of the families was put to the torch by its rival, and the ground burned to ashes – but the ground only. The tower is still there to this day, the only wooden tower of this height in the town, but it has no first floor. Indeed it floats from the second floor up, but it stays in place no matter the wind. It was even inhabitat a while afterwards, but with the distrust in magic growing the family that owned it later moved away and now is rumoured to have left no inheritors. There have been some attempts in the past to remove or destroy the floating tower, but none did succeed so far. Today the floating tower is protected by the military, mostly to prevent hotheads from another attempt to burn it – along with the rest of the town while trying.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>Mariner’s quarter</h2>\n<p>Mariner’s quarter is the underbelly of @UUID[.dwAJ5Jtc6ii8zQoh]{Mohkba}, known for its cheap brothels and ramshackle pubs. But even in this bad place is a national icon to be found, the Navy Museum, a colorful painted wooden house. It exhibits the wooden boat, great-grandfather of Klavekia’s navy, that was sent out on the water of the Lake of Angelic Tears by the young Tsar Alexei III. Sadly that’s the only thing exhibited in the whole museum.</p>\n<p>According to legend, there was a stone idol standing in what is now the Mariner’s quarter that the ancient centaurs worshiped. The hermit Natalya prayed and received a magical staff from a divine elk with which she destroyed the idol, and then built a church on the site of the pagan shrine. Before going to fight the Vikmordere, Tsar Alexei the Twin made a pilgrimage to the monastery to take the staff of Natalya. After the battle of the Serpent, the tsar in gratitude built a cathedral where the church stood, one of the first multi-altar churches, which have additional altars dedicated to different gods. The interior of this cubic six-domed church is unusual: The arches are supported by five pillars, which gives the effect of volume. It could justifiably be called the pearl of that period of Klavekian architecture and its domes, walls, door frames and all other available surfaces are full of mural paintings. In modern days the cathedral is seldom visited, and but the altar of the gods dedicated to the sea and to long voyages is cleaned regularly. The staff of Natalya is rumored to have inspired Tarissov the Leprous in building the first @UUID[.1hMoSKS1OqlchIwq#the-blank-staffs]{Blank Staff}. This made his treason the more unbearable and added to the neglect of the Church of Natalya’s Staff.</p>\n<h3>The Empty Pedestal</h3>\n<p>In the Harbour area stands the famous Empty Pedestal, by itself a rather blank structure with no artistic value whatsoever, but in ancient time Leo II, The Tsar in the Bowl, had his crystal home on this pedestal overlooking the harbour and looking for outside help to break his curse. Its not clear who cursed him or why, and tales blame everyone from the Vikmordere, the clerics, the magicians to his own relatives for the vile deed. His grandson did break the bowl in 173, not wanting to be a mere regent as his father has been, thereby killing the tsar or what was left of him and provoking a short civil war known as the days of the Cleared Succession or the days of the Murdering Tsar by his enemies. The infamous victory speech by Tsar Leo IV was held standing on the very pedestal that held his grandfather for so many decades, and it was one of the longest and most winding speeches in the history of Mohkba, rumoured to have crashed the last resistance to his rule by boring all dissidents to death. Leo IV was known as the chattering tsar or the shattering tsar for many decades until Tsar Anatol VIII decided the matter almost 150 years later by naming Leo IV the Tsar who Broke the Bowl. Until today the people of Mohkba express their feelings toward the government by placing various fishes on the empty pedestal, each of them with a different meaning. Knowing which fish means what is a science in itself and a riddle to even many people of Mohkba, let alone foreign guests. Most governments see any fish in any position and any state of decay as an insult to them nowadays, which lets the pedestal been guarded most of the time and certainly when government is cutting public spending or raising taxes.</p>\n<h3>Dancing Skeleton</h3>\n<p>Once during the many wars with the Vikmordere a regiment of Klavekian archers managed to surprise a ritual by the Vikmordere. Suspecting a vile purpose of this ritual the archers peppered everyone attending in the grove, slaying everyone – almost. When the storm of arrows ceased, only the leading shaman was still on his feet and dancing, amidst a sea of dead. The next volley of arrows hit him exclusively, but, even being obviously dead, the dance continued. The Klavekian were scared, but took the shaman captive, without getting any response from him. Even bound he twitched in his dance moved with vacant, dead eyes. Back in Mohkba the shaman was showered with positive energy to no avail and ultimately thrown in a pool of acid, where his flesh receded, but his skeleton still danced. It was bound again and put away in a deep cell.</p>\n<p>An unknown number of decades later Tsar Alexei V., later called the ‘Mad Tsar’, decided to bolster morale of the citizens by putting the shaman on display. So the skeleton dances on a pedestal, at first closely watched by clerics and guards, but these days only by an honour guard of veterans of Klavekian skirmishes or battles with the Vikmordere. Oddly enough the few Vikmordere ambassadors that have visited Mohkba and seen the shaman have been reported to not be offended by the sight, but smiling knowingly, which unsettled more than one of the veterans guarding the Dancing Skeleton. But since the skeleton is dancing for more than 250 years by now and nothing visibly bad has come out of it yet, the citizens of Mohkba see the Dancing Skeleton as nothing more than a celebrated oddity, a trophy of war and a symbol of the weirdness of their Vikmordere neighbors.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h3>Spitting Statue</h3>\n<p>At the harbour of @UUID[.dwAJ5Jtc6ii8zQoh]{Mockba} is the statue of Dimitrij Denisonovitch, most honoured advisor to Tsar Pjotr the Diplomat and, for a very short time, of his successor Alexei the Twin. Denisonovitch is portrait as an especially ugly man, with an evil looking face, a long hook-like nose and a hunchback. It is well known that he featured none of this in his life, having been a rather handsome and charismatic man, but he counseled his Tsars toward accepting surrender and tribute to the Vikmordere, like Mohkba paid to the Saatman Empire before. His statue was erected to remember the people of the price of betrayal, for Denisonovitch was beheaded on the very first day of the reign of Alexei the Twin in 1096 for this craven council, and until this day passerby spit on the statue as their sign of national pride. There are rumours though that before 1096 there had been another statue of Denisonovitch, built by Pjotr the Diplomat for former successes of his councellor, showing the real self with a concerned face, and some people did cut themselves in front of this statue of Denisonovitch to let a drop of blood or two spill at his feet, for in the first battles of the Twin’s war theVikmordere claimed much blood of Mohkba and won most of them. Denisonovitchs council seemed wiser those days, but with the shifting tides of war and victory increasingly favouring Mohkba the old statue was toppled and later replaced by the new and ugly one, and today a different body fluid is offered to the advisor that failed from grace.</p>\n<h3>Statue of the Shamans</h3>\n<p>In the Vikmordere wars, Mohkba was frequently plundered, at least in parts, but at one time the Vikmordere tried to stay to conquer the town of their enemies once and for all. Chieftain Angus the Old died shortly after this decision, many claiming being struck down by the gods for his decision, and the Vikmordere went away to being splintered tribes as before. But a relic from those days is the statue of ice, vaguely build like a sea snake, was left behind by the Vikmordere. It still is in the @UUID[.LGCNFtJ4cWlq0HjE#mariners-quarter]{Mariner’s Quarter} as a warning from the Vikmordere threat, an oddity from times long past, and a part of the city defences. The serpent statue has a faint glimmer of conjuration magic. If touched and used as a focus component during the casting of summon swarm, summon monster or summon nature’s ally, and the spell is used to summon a serpent swarm or giant serpent, the spell lasts for an additional round, and, in the case of a summoned swarm, the swarm does not attack the caster, so long as he retains hold of the statue, allowing him to stand freely in the area of the swarm. The statue provides no such protection against serpent swarms conjured by others or encountered normally.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>Gardener’s quarter</h2>\n<p>On the Gardener’s quarter’s central square, Natalyaskaya Ploshchad, stands a monument in honor of the hermit Natalya. Natalyaskaya Ploshchad practically runs into another square, named after Yuri Sansurov who sacrificed his life for the sake of young tsar Alexei the Twin. Outside Gardener’s Quarter is Chistoye Boloto, the clean bog, into which Sansurov led the Vikmordere who had come to capture the Klavekian tsar, there by sacrifying himself for his tsar.</p>\n<p>The Gardener’s quarter has an elk farm in honor of Natalya the hermit. This is one of the few places in the world where druids have been successfully breeding elks for 90 years now. Pilgrims can not only take a good look at the elks but interact with them too. Trying elk milk is an absolute must since it has an unusual flavor and is known to grant divine favors every few years.</p>\n<p>There are about 15 gardens and parks in the Gardener’s quarter alone. A favorite recreation spot is the pine wood within its center. Here is the Klavekian Calling celebrated, the traditional custom for greeting the spring, calling the elks and the warming sun. Its on a small but long hill with a spring near its top, and in winter few children can resist the temptation to slide down the frozen slippery slope on their backsides or on sledges. The spring is also famous throughout Mohkba for its water purity.</p>\n<p>There are more than 13 bridges in the quarter. Many artisans come here for inspiration, which visitors are reminded of by monuments to writers, painters and druids that decorate gardens, parks and promenades. In the warm season there are six fountains in the squares and parks leading to ponds, little waterfalls and a boulder three-span bridge decorated with a unique carved iconostasis of rose, walnut and birch.</p>\n<p>Gardeners quarter was once the private property of the son of a simple Gardener. In childhood he fled from his father to a neighboring village, where he lived with the priest and sang in church. His beautiful voice drew the attention of a major who was driving by, who took the boy and brought him to Mohkba, to the delight of the tsarina, Tatjana Valakova, who loved his beautiful singing. The 22-year-old ‘voice of an angel’ became involved with the princess Anna Alexeievna. After she became tsarina, she awarded her lover some property and the rank of general, marrying him in secret. The influence wielded by this favorite of the tsarina became colossal, as did his wealth and land ownership. However, Gregory the Gardener remained throughout a modest and pious man, who financed the construction of many churches and always viewed his exalted status with humor. Later, when offering an explanation for Anna’s choice, one of her nieces recalled Gregory as one of the most beautiful men she had met in her whole life. After his death he dedicated his beloved garden to the people of Mohkba, to be tended by druids, and thus Gardener’s Quarter was founded and named after him.</p>\n<h2>Zveni Island</h2>\n<p>The Mohkba Lake’s individual shape can be explained by its glacial origins. It is in fact several lakes, joined to each other by short narrow canals, stretching in a chain from west to east for 50 kilometers. At its eastern end, at the mouth of Serpent Tail River, is Zveni Island. Its thus far away from the capital, but Alexei the Twin deemed it so important that he named it part of the capital itself, and that was never changed. The decision made Mohkba the biggest town of the world, at least if one measures size by east-west miles.</p>\n<p>On the remote Zveni island a monastery had been built, which today is connected with the mainland by bridge. In the early days of the empire a hermit called Gregory settled on the island. He was given the nickname Stolbensky, from the word “stolb” meaning pillar. After his death, fame spread far and wide of his the healing power, and the monastery became a center of pilgrimage, one of the largest in Klavekia. Not many years later an unique ensemble came together, and today the monastery comprises seven churches and 30 buildings in the tradition of Mohkba architecture. The shores of the island were reinforced with granite embankments. The monastery became a veritable “city of clerics,” a little part of Mohkba by some miracle abandoned in the wilderness of the region.</p>\n<p>As told in a legend, Zveni got its name, ‘bell-tolling’, thanks to its bells, which rang out for hundreds of miles around. When neighboring villages heard them, they also began to sound the alarm by tolling bells, and so on until the signal reached Mohkba, warning the capital of the kingdom of the approach of the Vikmordere enemy. Thus, Zverni was destroyed many times, and rebuilt after every attack. The Tsars did this in part out of piety, in part out of military thoughts and in part because the island became sort of a repository for unwanted wives and daughters and politically dangerous persons of both genders. To die on the island is said to grant a dying limited wish, but it has to be worded carefully and can’t have a political or military approach, for the first tsar who had died on the island, Gregory the Other Twin, also known as the Shortlived, had wished it so.</p>\n<p>Entry to the monastery is through two arches, one of which stands at the bridge, and the other at the pier. Rebuilt only a few years ago, it nonetheless is famous for its rich decoration of klavekian baroque and frescoes in the style of oreadean masters. The main hall is bright and spacious with four pillars that bear arches. On the walls are two thematic series: seven paintings depicting the various battles with the Vikmordere and four illustrating the Miracles of Gregory Stolbensky.</p>\n<p>Water clarity in this part of the lake can be up to 5 meters. The lake is inhabited by about 20 species of fish, including smelt, bream, perch, burbot, whitefish, ide and pike, but also the occasional sea serpent. The forests are rich with game and poultry. There is a park on the shore, overlooking the lake, and a cape in the south of the island is covered with meadows. On the very point of the headland is a snow-white church which has miraculously survived the last two Vikmordere attacks unharmed.</p>\n</div>","markdown":""},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"sort":700000,"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}},{"name":"Klavekian Grasslands","type":"text","_id":"J642N3NDDUewmTFn","title":{"show":false,"level":1},"image":{},"text":{"format":1,"content":"<div class=\"aventyr\"><p class=\"s5\">Klavekian Grasslands</p><h2>Weather</h2><p>The winters on the Klavekian Grasslands last seven to nine months. Temperatures vary from −40 °C to 36 °C throughout the year. The summers are short but sometimes even hot, with plant life exploding as to make up for a whole year in but a few weeks.</p><p>The grassy plains in the Klavekian lowlands are a very windy area, with winds often blowing upwards of 40–90 km/h. It lies on top of permanently frozen soil called permafrost.</p><p>During the spring, the permafrost thaws just enough to let plants grow and reproduce. The ground below it stays frozen though, so the water can’t sink low, and so forms the streams, lakes and marshes found during the snowless months.</p><p>Rivers of the Klavekian Grassland flow over the same permafrost, so they erode their banks rather than the bottoms. They usually consist of countless channels, and can be difficult to cross. Most of them dry out after the end of the thawing period, leaving not many traces behind them until the next spring.</p><p>Most of the permanent rivers freeze to the bottom in some places. Water breaks the ice and then freezes on top of it. These ice plugs, called naled in the region, often don’t melt until the next autumn. If this happens on the important Serpent Tail River, which connects the @UUID[.ulLkhApELbg08M4o]{Klavekian mainlands} to the @UUID[JournalEntry.ismpCNWpGHvB1iPw.JournalEntryPage.Erya8w29cRTTJELu]{Serpent Lake}, it’s a major obstacle for trade, so the government sends spellcasters to remove these dangers by magical fire. Travel is not easy in these times of the year, and sometimes there are casualties in spite of the government efforts. Locals want the magicians to be permanently located near their villages, or at least for the duration of winter, but that has not been ordered so far despite of the protests.</p><p></p><h2>Flora</h2><p>As soon as the snow melts, the “Klavekian Pervenets” (The Firstborn) grows up thickly around the rivers and lakes. This huge grassy plant announces the start of the growing season after the winter is gone. Its juice has a sweet taste, but leaves blisters and sores on the skin that ache for months and has a 50% chance of lowering the dexterity score by one point until healed. The people of the three villages extract a form of sweet sugar out of it, and also distill wine that produces wonderful dreams after just one or two glasses. The dreams can carry portents sometimes; there is a 5% chance per glass drunk, up to a maximum of 10%, that the drinker can cast augury like a caster of third level right after waking up, regardless of his real class level or even if she is no spellcaster at all. The augury may happen or not, but another side effect does always take place; in the morning the drinker feels miserable and is nauseated for the next three hours per glass imbibed. Strangely the wine distilled out of Klavekian Pervenets as well as the juice itself loses its potency after only three days, so transporting it to larger markets is a huge challenge.</p><p>Maybe even better known in Klavek is one kind of plant that appears shortly after the Firstborn, but keeps growing in huge patches until late autumn. Talgana is a truly giant herb that reaches up to 3,5ms in height, a remarkable example of the famously tall forms of Klavek flora. In autumn, the stems can hide a wooly rhino easily. Inside the thickets, the sun and skies are hidden by the broad leaves, and bears’ paths cleave the wall of stems like tunnels. Talgana’s leaves are soft and its stems are easy to move apart with hands or a stick. Its young sprouts are edible, so much so that for bears they are a remedy against hunger in the early summer when there are neither berries nor fish yet. In winter-time, with snow on their umbels, these giants look like exotic trees, and numerous stories for children link them to fairies, but such a link is not proven by sages. They finally cave-in under their white burden when winter takes its course.</p><p>Aside from these endemic plants, this region supports numerous other species of rare flora, particularly grasses, herbs and shrubs. These shrublands are difficult to cross and full of bugs and other insects in summer, but they are a much better place than the neighboring regions for surviving the winter. A lot of wildlife uses them as shelter.</p><h2>Fauna</h2><p>One of the world’s largest herds of moose breeds in the Klavekian Grasslands, and there are three kinds of elk living here, from the smaller normal elks up to the river elk and then onto the megaloceras, but all in all the region is known for its megafauna. Vast herds travel the flatland, most of them following the seasons by going north in spring and south in autumn. They are followed by their predators like the smilodons or ice trolls in most cases, but there are exceptions to the hunting techniques used by creatures such as this, as described in the next paragraph.</p><p>One of the greatest predators in the Grasslands is the addanc, which lives like a beaver and builds dams. When prey tries to cross the water in its territory, it attacks like a crocodile. The various oozes of the region, most notably the grey ooze, the glacial ooze and the white pudding, also tend to be lurking hunters. However, the king of the Grasslands is the one-eyed frostwurm, which even attacks herds of mammoth. It radiates cold, is 35 feet long and weighs 8,000 pounds.</p><p>Other strange hunters include the flightless Ahlinni-birds or the hunting parties of Mimi, the sole fairy of the Grasslands, which have their villages mostly in the nearby forest, but roam the plains for prey. Also on the plains are the fogwarden (spelt the same for singular and plurals), aberrations that look like fog taking a humanoid form. The sight of their ice blue eyes has doomed more than one adventurer who had seen herself as a predator, not prey.</p><p>Maybe the most unusual species for this environment is the Kolasuchus, an amphibian, because it is known for surviving deep freezes, as low as -35 to -40°C. In some cases Kolasuchi have been known to remain frozen in permafrost for years, and after thawing, just walking off.</p><h2>Lake Voltaran</h2><p>One of the few permanent lakes in the Klavekian Grassland is Lake Voltaran, an enormous flooded volcanic caldera where more than a million salmon gather and spawn every year. The water is warm and doesn’t freeze in winter due to volcanic activity or a quasi-dormant gate to the Elemental Plane of Fire, depending on what sage you are listening to. The lake is a lifesaver for many species in the dead of winter, prey or predator, but a hunting ground for very dangerous monsters also. Travelers are wise to avoid it if their lifes don’t depend on its warmth.</p></div>","markdown":""},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"sort":800000,"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}},{"name":"Klavekian Staffweaving","type":"text","_id":"1hMoSKS1OqlchIwq","title":{"show":false,"level":1},"image":{},"text":{"format":1,"content":"<div class=\"aventyr\"><p class=\"s5\">Klavekian Staffweaving</p><h2>The Blank Staffs</h2><p>When confronted with the strange @UUID[JournalEntry.QlctNkzE9injOde9.JournalEntryPage.I4CpK8rTs0HgD7hW]{Vikmordere} magic the traditional wizards of the @UUID[.ulLkhApELbg08M4o]{Klavekian Empire} were at first at a total loss. No one had ever seen such magic as the savage Northmenn could wield. The Vikmordere wouldn’t explain how they did it for obvious reasons and Vikmorere prisoners sooner died then shared tribal secrets. Explorers sent to neighboring lands came back empty handed also.</p><p>Finally, Tarissov the Leprous, Magister of the Klavekian Academie of Magical Arts, came forth with a solution for at least part of the problem. He invented the famous Blank Staffs, magical tools to not only explore foreign magic, but to steal its secrets to a degree. When a spellcaster is hit with a Blank Staff she loses a prepared spell to it. The owner of the Blank Staff can then use the stolen spell. Strangely, when the user of a Blank Staff would be able to cast the stolen spell on its own, the magic vanished, but leaving the Blank Staff rechargeable once more. In the times when the Blank Staff was invented, those magic has not vanished at all, but been transferred to Tarissov the Leprous himself, who in this way became mightier and mightier. Finally, he felt strong enough to challenge the tsar himself, but he overestimated his abilities and was finally slain after what is known as the War Without Faces. Where the magic of a Blank Staffs vanishes now is uncertain, some speculate that Tarissov the Leprous isn’t dead at all, still accumulating power, other say the magic simply dripples away.</p><p>The magic needed to create Blank Staffs went to the grave with Tarissov the Leprous and is lost. But since the traitor-magician wanted the Blank Staffs to be spread wide he produced great amounts of them and sold them cheaply in what was viewed as a patriotic act those days. The Blank Staffs aren’t cheap anymore, but still readily available on the Magical Fair, charged or uncharged. Buyers have to beware though, there are Blank Staffs staffs with magic in them that no one can use, since the user has to be able to understand the magic in the staff on principle. An arcane specialist can’t used a stolen divine spell. The Vikmordere do have something entirely different sometimes, the so called mosaic magic. Only rarely are staffs with mosaic magic useable by any non-Vikmordere in Klavek.</p><h2>Empty Staffs</h2><p>While the magic to create @UUID[.1hMoSKS1OqlchIwq#the-blank-staffs]{Blank Staffs} is lost, the general art of staffbinding has made strides in @UUID[.ulLkhApELbg08M4o]{Klavek}. In these days it is possible to create staffs that are empty in their own ways. The procedure of creating them is expensive and time consuming, but also very flexible. The exact method is a guarded secret of the Klavekian Academie of Magical Arts, but the effect is, when a buyer wants a specific staff, he has to pay an extra amount of money equal 20%, but gets his staff in but 24 hours, for the raw Empty Staff had been prepared in advance. Since other nations still use methods that take a hundred days to produce an individual staff, Klavek’s magicians have a sharp competitive edge in emergencies or with clients not known for their patience. On the other hand, the Magical Fair is known to have most common staffs readily available to buy at normal costs if one spends some time searching, so Empty Staffs would usually be only required for exotic or rare inventions if it was just a matter of speed. With a successful DC 15 Spellcraft check the Empty Staff can be filled with additional magic for the usual fees (and 20%) by a skilled staffweaver, though a failed check makes the Empty Staff unusable for a full moon circle (a month). Empty Staffs are used for Bonded Objects or by wizards who don’t want to use an Efficient Quiver to sort through their magical staffs.</p><h2>Two Staff Weaving</h2><p>Klavekian spellcasters have perfected the art of fighting with staffs since Tarissov the Leprous days. Lukov the Fencer was the first magician to invent the art of Two Wand Weaving, and this feat is still popular in modern Klavek.</p></div>","markdown":""},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"sort":900000,"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}},{"name":"Lineage of Klavekian Tsars","type":"text","_id":"T3yjCTV19TztrWUu","title":{"show":false,"level":1},"image":{},"text":{"format":1,"content":"<div class=\"aventyr\"><p class=\"s5\">Lineage of Klavekian Tsars</p><ul><li><p><strong>About -520-490:</strong> Years of the Angry Sea, the Kraken terrorizes the eastern shores of what is today’s modern @UUID[.ulLkhApELbg08M4o]{Klavek}</p></li><li><p><strong>About -500:</strong> @UUID[.dwAJ5Jtc6ii8zQoh]{Mohkba} founded by Prince Yuri Dvagaslov, the Holy Knight of the Crossroad. @UUID[.LGCNFtJ4cWlq0HjE#divine-quarter]{The Sophianeum }is built in Mohkba, or, by a different account, the city is built where the Sophianeum already stood.

Holds up at the docks are not helped by Dockmaster Casta, who tries to get his greedy fingers into as many pies as possible. From charging unheard of (and obscenely high) “docking fees,” “cargo fees,” or “passenger fees,” that money goes straight into Casta’s pocket. Although there have been numerous complaints to Marshall Mulcahey, Casta has a complex system of how the docks are run that no one else understands and Tatiana came to the conclusion that hiring a new dockmaster and untangling everything at the docks would end up costing more than the town can afford, so she allows Casta to charge these fees, but talks with him occasionally about making sure some of those funds make their way to the city coffers.</p>\n<h2>Torrent</h2>\n<p><strong>Alignment and Type:</strong> True Neutral small town</p>\n<p><strong>Modifiers Crime:</strong> +1, Law -3, Lore +1, Society +4</p>\n<p><strong>Qualities:</strong> Academic, Notorious</p>\n<p><strong>Danger:</strong> 10</p>\n<p><strong>Disadvantages:</strong> –</p>\n<p><strong>Government:</strong> Magical</p>\n<p><strong>Population:</strong> 275</p>\n<p><strong>Notable NPCs:</strong> Matron Elizabeth Dunleavy, Daughter of Nature (CN, female, Klavek (human), Druid 11), Yugorg Daemonbreaker, Jailor (LN, male, ogre, Fighter 6)</p>\n<p><strong>Base Value and Purchase Limit:</strong> 1,300/7,500</p>\n<p><strong>Spellcasting:</strong> 6th</p>\n<p><strong>Minor Items</strong> 3d4; <strong>Medium Items</strong> 1d6; <strong>Major Items</strong> –</p>\n<p>Torrent, named for the increase in the speed of the where the two rivers join, is the “middle child” of the Three Sisters.

Separated from the other nations by the blasted deserts of the North, and the cliffsides overlooking the ocean to their East, the outside interferences within their growing culture were few and far in between. Developing a spiritual belief system that relies heavily upon the animal spirits around them, as well as the spirits of the moon and sun, and heavily practicing human sacrifice, the N’rcul experienced a true miracle, when, following the passing of a beloved ruler, their leader returned from the grave, restored to life, stronger and filled with the power of the spirits themselves. Kham-a-Tael rose from the grave ignorant of the world outside of his lands, knowing no more of the mysteries of the world then his people, and truly believed that he and only he had been chosen to return from the other side by the spirits, as a sign to his people, a sign that the spirits are listening, and they are watching.</p>\n<p>Kham-a-Tael’s rising sparked a religious fervor within his people, a renewed strength within the nations under his name, and renewed hope for the future of these lands. It was into these lands that a pair of undead were drawn, sensing the power of a newly awakened, and extremely powerful, undead, an unlikely pair of traveling companions (The Vampire Davional, and the @UUID[.mALZCj1Avtm347FY]{Lich Malakittal}). Presenting himself to The Risen Lord within his sleeping chambers, Davional set about establishing nightly visits with the curious undead lord, building a rapport, staying only long enough each night to make sure the interest was there, until the two had gotten familiar enough with each other that the talks got lengthier and lengthier, building to the point that Davional and Malakittal were given rooms within the temples to better accommodate them. It was through these late night conversations that Davional began to educate Kham-a-Tael as to what he believed him to be (a mummy), and several of the abilities demonstrated by Kham-a-Tael supported the theories of the cunning vampire.</p>\n<p>It was within these conversations that Davional laid the seeds for Kham-a-Tael’s mistrust of the outside world, and allowing outsiders to know of the miracle of his rebirth, and in friendship offered to both Davional and his companion Malakittal a permanent place of safety within his lands as well. Davional, realizing the possibility, took the offer a step further, and countered the offer with a safe means of utilizing the resources of the lands to make both his own and Kham-aTael’s people profitable, while guaranteeing that outside influences would be kept at bay. Davional offered to take the edges of NaeraCull for his own people, the Wandering Nation, forming a living buffer between the N’rcul and the outside world, and begin setting up trade with other nations and consortium’s for the natural resources of the rainforest, with the people’s of the wandering nation and the N’rcul supplying the work force, splitting labor between the materials being harvested. Convincing the Risen Lord that it was only a matter of time before a force to large to repel would arrive and begin harvesting resources against their will, it was only logical that they preemptively set up trade relations of their own. All connections were made from Davional’s people, and work began immediately on gathering the Wandering Nation and building them a home to call their own, as well as setting up mining sites, harvesting camps, and farms to utilize local fauna such as the cacao and several other rare herbs.</p>\n<p>Of all the materials available however, the desert offered up the strangest, in the form of raw glass. The deserts of NaeraCull lie within the path of the Scorched Lands, and as such are subjected to temperatures that fuse dunes of sand into glass on a regular basis. Organizing a workforce comprised of constructs, golems and undead all under the watchful eye of a handful of trusted subservient necromancers, Davional has turned the harvesting and export of glass into an extremely lucrative enterprise.</p>\n</div>","markdown":""},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{"core":{"sheetClass":""}}},{"sort":200000,"name":"Malakittal","type":"text","_id":"mALZCj1Avtm347FY","title":{"show":false,"level":1},"image":{},"text":{"format":1,"content":"<div class=\"aventyr\">\n<p class=\"s5\">Malakittal</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center\"><strong>Malakittal, the shadow behind the thrones</strong></p>\n<p> </p>\n<img style=\"float:right;margin:0px 15px 15px 0px;border:0px\" src=\"modules/aaw-games-aventyr/Setting-images/Malekittal-272x300.webp\" width=\"272\" height=\"300\" />\n<p>The Lich who had no desire to be, Malakittal was a cruel and selfish child, gifted with an abnormal intellect amongst his peers, but a complete lack of social grace. Sold into apprenticeship to an older wizard, Malakittal’s father was more than happy to watch his son disappear over the horizon. It was that devalued concept that hardened the heart and soul of the boy who would, within the next year, poison and slay his mentor, and flee into the night with a collection of his tomes. Hiding in the underbelly of a city is an even easier thing to do when you have magical tricks at your disposal to trade with the local guild, and Malakittal soon found himself a means to get by while he studied. At least until the first time he lost control of a spell he was attempting to to cast, and it cost the life of a valued guild member. strung up and disemboweled, left to die, all should have ended in lonely violence for Malakittal, but such was not to be the case.</p>\n<p>Upon piercing the veil, and casting his gaze upon the first realms of death, as his life left his body, terror tore through the young man’s frame, for there was his arcane master, like a rabid dog, at the end of a chain held by a terrifying Demonic being. With the last breaths of life did Malakittal learn that he had interfered with a demonic pact, and had left his former teacher unable to uphold his end of the deal. Seeing no value yet within Malakittal, the Demon trapped his soul, binding it within a crystal prison, and used his foul magics to force lichdom upon what was left of the young man’s body. Sent back amongst the living, a thing of undeath and fear, Malakittal fled the city, and went even further into hiding. Several hundred years passed between that night in that back city alley, and the night everything would change for ever in the “life” of Malakittal. The night he met Davional.</p>\n<p>Davional was merely looking for a place to wait out the passing of a caravan. Transporting several relics from one temple to another, this caravan had enlisted the aid of a full contingent of Templars and a handful of Paladins, seeking to guarantee the safe arrival of their cargo. It was enough of a threat that Davional, a vampire with several generations of age to his name, felt it better to seek a deeper shelter until they had left his lands, rather than risk discovery and be forced to defend himself. It was this need for a deeper tomb that led the two unlikely friends to first meet, the charismatic vampire, and the antisocial lich. Davional, being ever the opportunist, recognized the power within his grasp, and manipulated the lich expertly, taking full advantage of his lack of social grace or experience, to earn the friendship and loyalty of this powerful being hiding from the world.</p>\n<p>Malakittal has been the shadow behind Davional ever since. When Davional relocated his people (the Wandering Nation) to NaeraCull, it was on the promise to Malakittal that the temperate environment would be good for him, and provide more opportunities to learn new arcane secrets. Establishing themselves within a land ripe with the cultural acceptance of human sacrifice has turned out to be of great amusement to Malakittal, as there is never a shortage of souls wishing to “aid” him in his research.</p>\n</div>","markdown":""},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{"core":{"sheetClass":""}}},{"sort":300000,"name":"The Dralman Documents","type":"text","_id":"Cxr0Se9MxlOrH7Ne","title":{"show":false,"level":1},"image":{},"text":{"format":1,"content":"<div class=\"aventyr\"><p class=\"s5\">The Dralman Documents</p><p></p><p>A skald of some renown, Theo Dralman was quested by the Grand University of @UUID[JournalEntry.QVrlu0lTv2vFtT5P.JournalEntryPage.dwAJ5Jtc6ii8zQoh]{Mohkba} to enter the dark jungle and learn all he could of the spirits to which the native people prayed, and how the @UUID[JournalEntry.QVrlu0lTv2vFtT5P]{Klavek Kingdom} could use this information to its own end.

It covers all known Crafts, from the most basic wooden utensils to the most complex of locks and traps, and Professions. Within towns and cities, guilds may exist if 10 or more inhabitants are involved in the same activity, but if asked which group they belong to by someone else, a craftsperson or giant of a particular profession will state, “Maakarioborkauppias.”</p>\n<h3>Maatilaoborllinen</h3>\n<p><strong>Maatilaoborllinen</strong> – meaning “owner of the giant lands” and the title used by those who farm or cultivate the agricultural areas of Obor.

It is an arcane position, one taken by a member of the wizard amalgamation or sorcerer collective. They frequently live slightly isolated lives as their magic can be unpredictable.</p>\n<h3>Obrovsky</h3>\n<p><strong>Obrovsky</strong> – meaning “of the giants”. It is a military position, usually populated by fighters, paladins and barbarians of all types and alignments, which can cause conflict of a deadly nature.

The dialect consistently suggests “we sell” as a group rather than individualizing any particular activity, reflecting the belief that all crafts and professions rely on each other to be successful.</p><h3>Votunruoka</h3><p><strong>Votunruoka</strong> – the group dialect of the <strong>@UUID[.bUzRK3wWLJPr3eIJ#maatilaoborllinen]{Maatilaoborllinen}</strong>, indicating that the group feeds giantkind, both in terms of providing raw food and cooked meals. It is another basic dialect that leaves little room for misunderstanding or use elsewhere. Giant druids use a form of this dialect.</p><h3>Votunsota</h3><p><strong>Votunsota </strong>–<strong> </strong>language used by the <strong>@UUID[.bUzRK3wWLJPr3eIJ#obrovsky]{Obrovsky}</strong>, full of martial phrases and strident exclamations as well as sections dealing specifically with might, power, arms and armor and battle tactics. It is a relatively straightforward language that can be used without confusion on a battlefield and doesn’t suffer from a possible misunderstanding in meaning when passed along a chain of command. It is at all times a practical and effective dialect.</p><h3>Votuntaika</h3><p><strong>Votuntaika</strong> – language used by the <strong>@UUID[.bUzRK3wWLJPr3eIJ#mezioborovy]{Mezioborovy}</strong>. Full or mysterious and arcane phrasing, it has elements of Draconic entwined within it. There are a number of mythical and legendary words of power within <strong>@UUID[.YvplRrSOlzeMa3MI#votuntaika]{Votuntaika}</strong> which act like metamagic feats when sufficiently understood and practiced, although these seem to only work for giants able to wield arcane power of some significance.</p><h3>Votunuskonto</h3><p><strong>@UUID[.YvplRrSOlzeMa3MI#votunuskonto]{Votunuskonto}</strong> – language used by the <strong>@UUID[.bUzRK3wWLJPr3eIJ#definicni-obor]{Definicni Obor}</strong>. As the language of religion, philosophy and guidance, it has to be clear and exact at all times. All texts and statements which deal with matters of the gods and the ways of giant life are now all recorded in <strong>@UUID[.YvplRrSOlzeMa3MI#votunuskonto]{Votunuskonto}</strong>, as well as the language they were originally received in. This has made the language a powerful tool in dictating the path the giants will take, as it links together the dictates of the gods over time.</p><h2><span id=\"Sub-types\">Sub-types</span></h2><h3><strong>Votunjatti</strong></h3><p><strong>Votunjatti</strong> – spoken by the @UUID[.0ru8kn3zml6fAvTq#athach]{Athach}. Whilst it is recognized by all Obri that athachs are actually aberrations, they are considered the Children of the Gods (see @UUID[.0ru8kn3zml6fAvTq#athach]{athach entry}). <strong>Votunjatti</strong> is even more simplistic than <strong>@UUID[.YvplRrSOlzeMa3MI#votunobri]{Votunobri}</strong>, a straightforward version that athachs have slipped into over the millennia. Some sages moot that it is in fact the gods’ original attempt at a language for a mortal creature (and that athachs are the first attempt at giants), an idea that is closely studied and debated.</p><h3><strong>Votunpilvi</strong></h3><p><strong>Votunpilvi</strong> – spoken by the @UUID[.0ru8kn3zml6fAvTq#cloud]{Cloud giants}. Although these giants have universally deep voices, the tone and flow of their dialect ranges between dark and brooding all the way to high and wispy, just as clouds themselves. Occasionally used by bards for songs and tales of attempts to take hold of the unobtainable.</p><h3><strong>Votuntupla</strong></h3><p><strong>Votuntupla</strong> – spoken by the @UUID[.0ru8kn3zml6fAvTq#ettin]{Ettins}. It is an odd dialect, one that is made up of repetition, double explanation or statement and sometimes cross purpose, particularly when arguments are taking place. It is (correctly) thought that the two heads of an ettin can each only speak part of their overall language capability and that if an ettin was to lose one head yet survive, they would find it very hard to communicate verbally.</p><h3><strong>Votunpalo</strong></h3><p><strong>Votunpalo</strong> – spoken by the @UUID[.0ru8kn3zml6fAvTq#fire]{Fire giants}, the dialect is, naturally, a fiery one, fully of inflammatory delivery and passionate appeals. It is a dialect that lends itself most easily to arguments and energetic activity. Many giants who wish to motivate those around them who make things include a smattering of this dialect.</p><h3><strong>Votunkuura/Votunhuurre</strong></h3><p><strong>Votunkuura/Votunhuurre </strong>– spoken by the @UUID[.0ru8kn3zml6fAvTq#frost]{Frost giants}, <strong>Votunkuura</strong> is a dialect with a significant number of clicking and cracking sounds in addition to actual words. <strong>Vutunhuurre</strong> is a little more delicate and is most frequently used to describe the lands within 100 miles of a frost giant’s home, particularly when discussing details of the natural environment.</p><h3><strong>Votunkunnas</strong></h3><p><strong>Votunkunnas </strong>– spoken by the @UUID[.0ru8kn3zml6fAvTq#hill]{Hill giants}. Like the hills themselves, the dialect is one that rolls, with noticeable peaks and troughs in delivery. It has a range of words to describe fertile land and is sometimes used by those in the druid circle to get complex points across to those knowledgeable about giants.</p><h3><strong>Votunmakeanveden</strong></h3><p><strong>Votunmakeanveden </strong>–<strong> </strong>spoken by the @UUID[.0ru8kn3zml6fAvTq#merrow]{Merrow}. It is a guttural dialect, full of liquid sounds and use of air bubbles in the throat. Not an easy dialect to get to grips with for those who do not speak Aquan.</p><h3><strong>Votunkaaos</strong></h3><p><strong>Votunkaaos </strong>– spoken by the @UUID[.0ru8kn3zml6fAvTq#ogres]{Ogres}. A highly-changeable, ever-adapting dialect that readily picks up words and phrases from other languages and, if spoken for relatively short periods in lands where other humanoids dwell, will morph into a good approximation of that land’s natives’ language.</p><h3><strong>Votunkivi</strong></h3><p><strong>Votunkivi </strong>– spoken by the @UUID[.0ru8kn3zml6fAvTq#stone]{Stone giants}, full of rumbles and grinding notes. Elders use a variation called <strong>Votunjalokivi</strong> when communing with the earth. Although it has close links to Terran, there are no recorded cases of non-stone giant elders being able to speak the dialect.</p><h3><strong>Votunmyrsky</strong></h3><p><strong>Votunmyrsky </strong>– spoken by the @UUID[.0ru8kn3zml6fAvTq#storm]{Storm giants}, it is an all-or-nothing dialect, sounding either at complete calm or alarmingly strident, even when being used, for example, to tell jokes.</p><h3><strong>Votunparantaa</strong></h3><p><strong>Votunparantaa </strong>– spoken by the @UUID[.0ru8kn3zml6fAvTq#trolls]{Trolls}, it is a dialect which can talk endlessly about any topic, given the chance. It folds back in on itself and develops and grows in a seemingly unstoppable way.</p><h3><strong>Votunalamaailma</strong></h3><p><strong>Votunalamaailma </strong>– spoken by the @UUID[.0ru8kn3zml6fAvTq#underworld]{underworld giants}, this dialect is frequently more easily used and understood by Underworld dwellers than other giants when first encountered. If listened to for a week, it becomes clear that it contains much that any other giant does actually understand but is a dark and shadowy version of Votun.</p><p>It is not known if there are any other languages or dialects used elsewhere by yet-to-be-encountered giant types. However, giant language and dialect is so heavily influenced by the land within which users live, particularly in delivery, that if giants do live in swamps, deserts or jungles, then it is more than likely that their dialect will have many components strongly influenced by those natural surroundings, such as the soft, shifting sounds of moving desert sands or dripping, lush noises of a tropical jungle.</p><p> </p></div>","markdown":""},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{"core":{"sheetClass":"core.JournalTextPageSheet"}}},{"sort":300000,"name":"Religion","type":"text","_id":"eSZclzdgw0E9gdK6","title":{"show":false,"level":1},"image":{},"text":{"format":1,"content":"<div class=\"aventyr\"><p class=\"s5\">Religion</p><p>The basis of all giant religion is called Vodoun. It is a traditional animistic religion; Vodoun origin, history and evolution centres around the vodoun spirits and other elements of divine and arcane essences that govern the Obor, a hierarchy that range in power from major deities governing the forces of nature and giant society to the spirits of individual streams, trees, and rocks, as well as dozens of ethnic vodoun spirits, defenders of a certain clan, tribe, or region as well as the nation as a whole.</p><p>The vodoun spirits are the centre of religious life, which is structured around doctrines such as the interaction of spirits (which usually manifest as angels, demons and devils) with living giants. A single adult giant is often a physical equal, if not superior, to an angel, demon or devil, so such interactions aren’t to be feared, more to be learned from.</p><p>Adherents also emphasise ancestor worship and hold that the spirits of the dead live side by side with the world of the living, each family of spirits having its own clearly-stated priesthood, sometimes hereditary, when the clerical or druidic responsibility is passed from parent to appropriate blood child.</p><p>Patterns of worship follow various dialects, gods, practices, songs and rituals. Vodoun recognises two overseeing creator deities with many lesser spirits called @UUID[.eSZclzdgw0E9gdK6#the-apulainen]{Apulainen (Helpers)}. The two creators, one divine and one arcane, called Pappi and Salainen respectively, are androgynous beings who combined to bear thirteen children. These children became the principal Apulainen spirits and Pappi and Salainen gave each rule over a realm of Obor.</p><p>The creators embody a dual principle of light and dark, in which Pappi represents light and the sun whilst Salainen represents darkness and the moon. Each aspect has good and bad points and is considered in positive and negative ways at different times for different reasons.</p><p>Of the thirteen children, twelve are still worshipped today. Each child, all also androgynous beings, now represents one of the twelve remaining giant types that live in Obor. Each giant type is loyal to their patron Apulainen, but gives praise and collection to Pappi and Salainen on appropriate days as well as to the lesser Apulainen of the society, clan and tribe they belong to, and to their own family spirits.</p><p>The thirteenth Apulainen represented the titans, who left Obor to travel the planes many millennia ago. They are no longer considered to be part of giantkind and are rarely referred to. It is considered to be extremely rude to talk of titans with any giant.</p><p>All creation is considered both divine and arcane, and therefore everything contains the power of both of these forces. This is how medicines such as herbal remedies are understood, and explains the casual use of mundane objects in religious ritual. Vodoun talismans, called “fetishes”, are objects such as statues, dried animal parts or manufactured items that are used for their healing and spiritually rejuvenating properties.</p><p>The @UUID[.bUzRK3wWLJPr3eIJ#definicni-obor]{Definicni Obor} and @UUID[.bUzRK3wWLJPr3eIJ#mezioborovy]{Mezioborovy }are entrusted to cast spells on or at enemies on behalf of supplicants, either calling upon vodoun spirits to bring misfortune or harm to a person or group or/and benefit to the supplicant. Sacrifice is a common way to show respect and thankfulness to the gods, usually consisting of something that has taken time, effort and energy to personally produce. Value is of secondary importance to these three factors.</p><p>Pappi and Salainen’s youngest child, @UUID[.eSZclzdgw0E9gdK6#ogres-–-kuopus]{Kuopus}, remains to this day in Obor and acts as a go-between with their other children; it is the principal Apulainen of the @UUID[.0ru8kn3zml6fAvTq#ogres]{ogres} and appears as either a young and virile female when something needs to be done urgently or takes the form of an old man when something needs to be learned and time is available.</p><p>The other chief Apulainen are listed below. After these principal Apulainen, there comes an entire range of lesser and least spirits. The most visible and easily recognised of these is Airut, a messenger spirit who relays messages between the giant world and the world of the Apulainen. It almost always takes the form of a dark, squat giant with a large bag over its shoulder and a pipe in its mouth. As the mediator between the gods and the living Airut maintains balance, order, peace and communication. Airut’s Pipe is able to cast spells and act as a weapon as it can transform into a two-handed hammer as a free action.</p><p>The principal Apulainen of the twelve giant types in Obor are listed below. Each can appear as a male or female as it chooses, or in its natural androgynous form. Each change is usually a free action that doesn’t provoke an attack of opportunity if undertaken in a situation where it is threatened.</p><p>The forms come complete with any clothing, armour and equipment the Apulainen choose to be wearing and carrying at that point. No item worn by an Apulainen remains if it chooses to leave Obor or if it is dismissed or banished. However, it is able to bring specific items to give to giants for a purpose.</p><p></p><h2>The Apulainen</h2><h3>Athach – Ennen</h3><p>Ennen appears as a five-limbed creature that chooses whichever configuration of limbs is most beneficial at that moment in time. It can change up to three limbs as a free action, but changing four or five is a move equivalent action. Although it mostly appears as either a male or female @UUID[.0ru8kn3zml6fAvTq#athach]{athach}, it can also appear as any four-legged beast that resides in Obor but have an arm sprouting from the middle of its back. Alternatively Ennen will walk amongst the athach as a rogue that is particularly dexterous, and attempt to get them to think about solutions to problems that don’t always involve brute strength.</p><h3>Cloud – Ylla</h3><p>Ylla will appear amongst the @UUID[.0ru8kn3zml6fAvTq#cloud]{cloud giants} as a male hunter with huskies or a female bard telling tales of lost souls. In both cases the form is neither particularly striking nor overly plain; it is in its actions that Ylla makes its point. It will also appear as a spectacular display of lenticular clouds over important events, either causing fear in the enemy or providing cover for attackers if required. Ylla will sometimes be found in the company of @UUID[.eSZclzdgw0E9gdK6#storm-–-salama]{Salama}, particularly when the latter is in dragon form, in a cloud form that confounds Salama’s abilities, allow each of them to hone their skills.</p><h3>Ettin – Kaksois</h3><p>Kaksois can appear as a martial-looking male or female @UUID[.0ru8kn3zml6fAvTq#ettin]{ettin} when it wishes to walk amongst its children. It can also appear as twins that are barely distinguishable from their faces but are clearly one male and one female if viewed in their entirety. The ettin forms are experienced and at their prime, whilst the twins are youngsters looking to gain help from the ettins and are a test of their tolerance and wisdom. Kaksois will occasionally appear as a sage, able to see both sides of an issue, and will mediate on a disagreement that hinders progress, whether of an individual ettin or the whole race.</p><h3>Fire – Hotkia</h3><p>Hotkia will appear as a burning fire giant to its followers, either a female cleric or male “paladin”, both of which will look to lead the @UUID[.0ru8kn3zml6fAvTq#fire]{fire giants} it has visited to greater glory. Hotkia will also appear as ceremonial fire at events where such is in place, which is just about every event you can think of that involves fire giants. The flames will be the purest red that any fire giant has seen, with the heat being a cleansing rather than damaging experience.</p><h3>Frost – Valkoinen</h3><p>Valkoinen chooses to appear either as a female ranger out to accompany those who face peril alone or as a monk accompanying travellers and asking them to test themselves as a group, perhaps to complete tasks they never imagined they would face. Valkoinen will also appear as snow fall where every flake is the same or as a layer of frost where every crystal is identical. In either case, it takes a cleric of Valkoinen 2d6 rounds to spot this, a follower [[/roll 2d4]] minutes and anyone with knowledge of giants [[/roll 5d6]] minutes. Once the snow or frost has finished falling ([[/roll 3d2]] hours), it will rise up into Valkoinen’s androgynous form and consider answering requests.</p><h3>Hill – Lehti</h3><p>Lehti appears either as a druid or as a barbarian, male or female. In any of these forms, Lehti is quite young, and always younger than the @UUID[.0ru8kn3zml6fAvTq#hill]{hill giant} it is appearing before. It will often offer to act as a helper for an individual hill giant going about an important or necessary task, slowly showing a more effective or efficient way of completing that task. Only when the task is complete and the hill giant concerned has thanked its new young friend will Lehti reveal itself in its true form, a cross between a hill giant and a treant, although much more like the former.</p><h3>Merrow – Jokijarvi</h3><p>Jokijarvi tends to present an appearance that is overwhelming: as a colossal elder water elemental, engulfing island-size patch of sentient seaweed, or a colossal kraken. It is even said that the great lake serpents are a taken form. At other times, Jokijarvi will walk amongst the @UUID[.0ru8kn3zml6fAvTq#merrow]{merrow} as a cleric, or very occasionally sorcerer. The merrow aren’t known for their spell casting ability, and every now and then Jokijarvi will conduct an “enlightenment drive” to ensure knowledge is spread by more merrow than shamen and tribal elders. These drives involve finding up to a dozen young merrow and providing the “Mark of All Merrow,” a birthmark that actually taps into innate spell casting ability and brings it forth.</p><h3>Ogres – Kuopus</h3><p>Kuopus is generally happy to let the image of @UUID[.0ru8kn3zml6fAvTq#ogres]{ogres} as crude boors ride, because it means they have to learn to stand on their own two feet and be rewarded by a distinct place in the world. Taking the typical barbarian form of the ogres, Kuopus encourages robust tournaments designed to let the cream of the ogres rise to the top, even as the god appears as an old man. But at other times, Kuopus walks amongst the ogres as the most charming and eloquent of their type, encouraging a self-expression that is usually held in almost brutal check. Often female, but not exclusively, Kuopus appears as a bard or story-telling illusionist, and revels that the ogres throw themselves whole-heartedly into can last for weeks. These revels encourage the often down-trodden ogres to face a world that despises them with renewed vigour. Kuopus is also the go-between for the other gods.</p><h3>Stone – Paasi</h3><p>The @UUID[.0ru8kn3zml6fAvTq#stone]{stone giant} people rarely see Passi, but they know their god is amongst them at all times. Passi IS stone, and has adopted the stone giants because of their affinity with the material, and is present as the mountains and lands the giants live on, work with, and use as tools, homes and weapons. If Passi does appear in a clearly recognisable form, it is as a travelling elder at a moot, or as an expert in some problem, stepping in to advise and guide, but never tell, a stone giant council or individual how to move on from an issue OR not make a mistake through a particular curse of action. Occasionally Passi will take the form of an ideal earth elemental from the dreams of stone giant children, although this is really just a slight variation in Passi’s usual form of stone itself.</p><h3>Storm – Salama</h3><p>Salama is a slightly contrary god, usually appearing as the opposite of the @UUID[.0ru8kn3zml6fAvTq#storm]{storm giant} who receives a visit. A heavily-armed fighter will see Salama as a robed monk, a wandering ranger sees a desk-bound mage or sage, an aristocrat sees a commoner, males see a female, and so on. Salama enjoys changing perception as much as the weather, and will present a form that encourages introspection and then release of hidden talents and unexpected innate abilities. If angry, Salama appears as a force dragon of a size sufficient to frighten whoever is the annoyance into an apology; all storm giant tales relate that Salama has never killed anyone or anything in this form, preferring to humiliate them and leave them bereft of all belongings and dignity. However, those tales also say that if Salama does kill someone when in dragon form, it will herald the end of the world. Salama is sometimes found with Ylla, who provides a worthy sparring partner for Salama’s force dragon form.</p><h3>Trolls – Oliivi</h3><p>Oliivi was once a simple @UUID[.0ru8kn3zml6fAvTq#trolls]{troll}, just like those walk Obor to this day. The difference between Oliivi and the trolls that came before is that the now-god found a way to channel the chaos and evil that trolls live by into unifying forces. Oliivi is actually responsible for introducing the isolationist views that all giants now hold, encouraging trolls to use their chaotic ways to promote troll clans over all others, and their evil approach to ensure troll elite were able to come out on top in any situation. Today, Oliivi will appear amongst the trolls as a ranger or druid of either sex, often when a tribe has fallen to ways that are too chaotic or too evil; after appearing out of seemingly nowhere, Oliivi will once again show that the way for trolls to succeed is to channel their natural instincts outwards onto others, not onto each other. This is a never-ending task</p><h3>Underworld – Maan–Uumenissa</h3><p>Little is known about Maan-Uumenissa, even by the @UUID[.0ru8kn3zml6fAvTq#underworld]{underworld giants} themselves. Stories say that the god bears the weight of the entire world at all times, and that providing places for the underworld giants to live and thrive is enough to give thanks for. Maan-Uumenissa is actually currently in torpor; when the world was struck by the “Shard of the Sun”, the carnage it caused (such as the Scarred Lands) struck the god deeply, and now Maan-Uumenissa rests to heal wounds that have damaged an entire planet. The god does visit the underworld giants on very rare occasions, usually as the ghost a mage who concentrates on spells associated with stone and force, or as the spirit of an expert stone mason able to carve a place to live from the solid mass of the Underworld. It is rumoured some @UUID[JournalEntry.QlctNkzE9injOde9.JournalEntryPage.t4LZuyNruvzneOHD]{deep dwarves} also worship Maan–Uumenissa, tapping into the god’s ability to work with stone to create particularly spiritual places far below the surface of Obor. If an alliance of these dwarves and giants ever occurs, other races will almost certainly find themselves out of a home.</p><p></p></div>","markdown":""},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}},{"sort":400000,"name":"Race History","type":"text","_id":"0ru8kn3zml6fAvTq","title":{"show":false,"level":1},"image":{},"text":{"format":1,"content":"<div class=\"aventyr\"><p class=\"s5\">Race History</p><h2>Athach</h2><p>Athach – The athach people came about as a result of <em>Pappi</em> and <em>Salainen</em> gathering together all the children of the other giant races that didn’t quite match the ideal they had in mind for them. They saw the advantage of a race that confounded belief, both within Obor and without, and ensured the newly-named athach race survived and, in its own way, flourished, with <em>@UUID[.eSZclzdgw0E9gdK6#athach-–-ennen]{Ennen}</em> charged to watch over it. To this day, the athach view themselves as special and chosen, but this knowledge is often enough to drive them to the brink of madness.</p><p><strong>Leader: </strong>Kolme Kadet - 5th level bard, 5th level fighter (Cha 13)</p><h2>Cloud</h2><p>Cloud – The cloud giants came into being from the very air, as <em>@UUID[.eSZclzdgw0E9gdK6#cloud-–-ylla]{Ylla}</em>, drew air, earth, fire and water together and moulded them into the clouds. To this day, cloud giants are able to show how each of the four elements are part of their “whole”, and explain why this sum is greater than the individual elemental parts. At their death, the most venerated cloud giants are afforded a ceremony which ensures their bodies are returned to the four elements in equal parts, so they can influence the very being of future members of the race.</p><p><strong>Leader: </strong>Tupruta Kevyt 12th level cleric</p><h2>Ettin</h2><p>Ettin – Ettin tales relate that when they were created, their maker <em>@UUID[.eSZclzdgw0E9gdK6#ettin-–-kaksois]{Kaksois }</em>had so much for them to say and do that two heads were necessary in order to achieve all that was required of them. Unfortunately, <em>Kaksois</em> failed to give any indication which head was in charge and so discord is as frequent a visitor as harmony. It is also said that if the two heads of a single ettin ever achieve complete agreement on every matter for the duration of a full moon, ettins everywhere will rise to lead the Obri nation in a wise and benevolent way.</p><p><strong>Leader: </strong>Kaksikko Paa 13th level fighter</p><h2>Fire</h2><p>Fire – Fire giants originally consisted of outcasts from all other societies, hotheads and rabble-rousers who drove others to despair before finding themselves permanently banished in order to save everyone else’s sanity. Many retreated from the land that was known, taking to the depths and lost places away from the hills and mountains that giants were used to living in. <em>@UUID[.eSZclzdgw0E9gdK6#fire-–-hotkia]{Hotkia}</em> is talked of as if the god actually walked amongst the earliest outcasts, leading them to the fiery rifts and heights that others ignored. These travels took the nomads to <em>Aitotulivuori</em>, the largest, most internally-active volcano in Obor. From here the fire giant tribes and clans grew, descending deep into the earth at the same time. Eventually a rift to the Elemental Plane of Fire was discovered, and the identity of the fire giants properly established.</p><p><strong>Leader: </strong>Palo Halko 6th level expert, 6th level warrior</p><h2>Frost</h2><p>Frost – The frost giants hold that they were the first giants, when <em>Pappi</em> and <em>Salainen</em> took it upon themselves to count the flakes of snow that fell on the ring of mountains far to the north of what is now Obor. As they landed, each became a giant; the first of these were the frost giants, who took their place at the top of the mountains. Others that followed became the other races and moved elsewhere to live their live, making the frost giants the pre-eminent members of their species. At least that is what the frost giants say, and who’s to doubt them. Their artefacts are clearly older than those of any other race, whilst <em>@UUID[.YvplRrSOlzeMa3MI#votunkuura/votunhuurre]{vutunhuurre }</em>has no direct link with any other Obri language, other than <em>@UUID[.YvplRrSOlzeMa3MI#votunkuura/votunhuurre]{votunkuura}</em>. Elderly frost giants are also known to occasionally hibernate, something no other giant-type does.</p><p><strong>Leader: </strong>Routainen Tanner 10th level sorcerer (Cha 18)</p><p></p><h2>Hill</h2><p>Hill – Hill giants took their place amongst the other races when no other giant wanted to live on the “lowlands”. Instead, those who found themselves at the bottom of their own hierarchy move away and banded together on the low peaks and wooded slopes of the Obor hills, becoming their own people. Although this life was difficult, without any of the massive majesty other giant environs offer, <em>@UUID[.eSZclzdgw0E9gdK6#hill-–-lehti]{Lehti }</em>show this new clan how to make the most of their new life and home, things which the hills giants still guard with jealousy, even as many secretly wish they could trace their heritage and return to an original home.</p><p><strong>Leader: </strong>Alava Kumpu 12th level paladin (Wis 14, Cha 12)</p><h2>Merrow</h2><p>Merrow – Although only the most senior clerics or deep-in-trance sorcerers of their will admit it, the original merrow were giants driven from the Obor lands for acting in the worst interests of all Obri. The exact nature of their actions is unclear, but the guidelines of the <em>@UUID[.bUzRK3wWLJPr3eIJ#definicni-obor]{Definicni Obor }</em>make a number of statements that refer to the “outcasts beyond our shores”. To the uninitiated, this seems to simply mean non-giants; internally, it refers to the merrow. <em>@UUID[.eSZclzdgw0E9gdK6#merrow-–-jokijarvi]{Jokijarvi }</em>took up their cause at the request of <em>Pappi</em> and <em>Salainen</em>, who ultimately want all giants to live together, yet know that those who don’t think of the Obri first and foremost need to pay a price. This price is being cursed to ultimately have to live in water, with only short periods on dry land.</p><p>Saltwater merrow are thought to exist, but are very rare if they do.</p><p><strong>Leader: </strong>Vesi Pesa 14th level druid</p><p></p><h2>Ogres</h2><p>Ogres – <em>@UUID[.eSZclzdgw0E9gdK6#ogres-–-kuopus]{Kuopus’s}</em> ogres have always been viewed by other giants as the children of <em>Pappi</em> and <em>Salainen</em>; they are usually loud, vulgar, and act in an out-of-control manner should they pick up barbarian tendencies. But they have also always been the link between the Obri and the outside world. The elves first realised this and gave the giants a number of islands of their eastern coast, where a part-elf-part ogre race developed and flourished, in order for the Obri to present skilled diplomats to the rest of the inhabitants of the planet. To this day, the agreed representative of all the giants is a member of this race, and has been for as long as giants can remember. As the go-between between his parents and the other <em>apulainen,</em> <em>Kuopus </em>knows what it is like to be an emissary,<em> </em>and ensures the chosen <em>elgres</em> do the very best job they can at all times.</p><p><strong>Leader: </strong>Rumilus Hirmu 13th level barbarian</p><h2>Stone</h2><p>Stone – As <em>Pappi</em> and <em>Salainen</em> created the frost giants, <em>@UUID[.eSZclzdgw0E9gdK6#stone-–-paasi]{Passi }</em>sat on a rock and watched. Eventually the ground froze, and then cracked, as the cold seeped into it. From the shards of rock that were created when these cracks occurred, the first stone giants were formed. They were charged with protecting the ground that made up Obor from the frost giants, offering other giant types a chance to find a place to call home. As caretakers of the land, stone giants take their duties very seriously, and will engage with another creature only until it promises to stop harming the land. Then will turn from foe to friend in a moment, help heal the individuals concerned, and send them on their way.</p><p>The stone giants also built the wall that surrounds Obor; along with gnome engineers, the wall was created within a month, with time to spare to have giants everywhere test it by hurling rocks at it. To this day, it has survived any and all assaults.</p><p><strong>Leader: </strong>Jalo Marmori 11th level rogue (Dex 17)</p><h2>Storm</h2><p>Storm – The contrary nature of <em>@UUID[.eSZclzdgw0E9gdK6#storm-–-salama]{Salama}</em> is what drove storm giants to leave the land and take to the air. However, <em>Salama</em> couldn’t quite leave the land behind, and granted storm giants to ability to raise up huge flying citadels that float as might the lightest feather. To this day, tales of aggrieved storm giants uprooting villages and small towns to either save them or punish them occur in equal measure. Storm giants are also called on when drought has occurred as they can, for the right price, ensure enough rain falls to satisfy even the most water-starved area.</p><p>Storm giants have also traditionally overseen the flying fortress that holds a sliver of the “Shard of the Sun” in a highly-protected sphere that is used to power a particularly effective weather machine. This particular task has fallen to one family for many years now, as is a task that is undertaken with complete seriousness.</p><p><strong>Leader: </strong>Alykas Kipina 14th level wizard (Int 17)</p><h2>Trolls</h2><p>Trolls – Any troll will tell you that they spontaneously stepped from the ground the moment <em>@UUID[.eSZclzdgw0E9gdK6#trolls-–-oliivi]{Oliivi} </em>decided that it should be so, and that they will never leave the land until <em>Pappi</em> and <em>Salainen</em> ask them to go. This means not only the troll species as a whole, but also the individuals that make up its number, particularly those that are able to spur the troll nation to bigger and better rewards. Within the giant lands, trolls tend to keep to themselves, fitting in with all the other giant types almost unnoticed. However, when decisions are to be made, senior trolls appear seemingly out of thin air to voice their strongly isolationist views. The other side of this is that they make better-suited individuals for certain professions, and can be trusted to the very end once a deal has been struck (unless another troll is involved).</p><p><strong>Leader: </strong>Kasvaa Paluu 7th Level ranger, 6th level druid</p><h2>Underworld</h2><p>Underworld – As with <em>@UUID[.eSZclzdgw0E9gdK6#underworld-–-maan–uumenissa]{Maan–Uumenissa}</em>, little is known about the history of the underworld giants, more because it is shrouded in mystery rather than individuals not knowing. Nothing is clear about why the original members retreated to the depths, or how they managed to establish themselves once they were there. In fact, the first few giants to retreat into the Underworld were a band who could not decide which of the other <em>apulainen</em> to follow, so left the surface of Obor to follow another path. <em>Maan-Uumenissa</em> found them wandering in despair, and vowed to support them forever onwards, even though the weight of the world was on the god’s shoulders. Since then, Underworld giants have slowly adapted to their home, and are now experts at getting the most from the cold, hard rock around them.</p><p><strong>Leader: </strong>Alempi Kamara 9th level monk (Dex 14, Wis 14)</p></div>","markdown":""},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{"core":{"sheetClass":"core.JournalTextPageSheet"}}},{"sort":500000,"name":"Regions","type":"text","_id":"DGCq9pB33FlnM4rY","title":{"show":false,"level":1},"image":{},"text":{"format":1,"content":"<div class=\"aventyr\"><p class=\"s5\">Regions</p><h2>Ydin-koto</h2><p>The north coast that runs along the side of the @UUID[JournalEntry.QVrlu0lTv2vFtT5P]{Klavek Kingdom} is known as Ydin-koto (Original Home). It is a narrow range of massively tall mountains, some of which are built into the wall surrounding Obor. It is the home of the @UUID[.0ru8kn3zml6fAvTq#frost]{frost giants}, along with many @UUID[.0ru8kn3zml6fAvTq#cloud]{cloud giants} and some storm giants. Links to the Elemental Planes of Air and Earth can be found here, although none are permanent. A continuous storm, roughly 10 miles across, follows a circular path that is about 1,500 miles in circumference, travelling at between 15 and 20 miles a day. Much of this storm is out at sea, but it works its way along the coast for about six or seven days of every 86 day cycle</p><h2>Aitotulivuori</h2><p>The home of the @UUID[.0ru8kn3zml6fAvTq#fire]{fire giants} is Aitotulivuori, which is about three miles high and surrounded by the taller, frozen mountains. It is also situated to the north of Obor, and is considered part of @UUID[.DGCq9pB33FlnM4rY#ydin-koto]{Ydin-koto} by non-giants. There are a number of deep rifts around the base of the volcano, at least two of which descend around nine miles underground. At this depth, a permanent link to the Elemental Plane of Fire can be found, although very few creatures, including the fire giants themselves, ever make it there. Any that are encountered are usually extraplanar visitors, with many coming to or going from a summoning, having completed their part of a bargain or spell; almost all are seen leaving with payments of some kind, sometimes in kind.</p><h2>Ylä–mäki</h2><p>Ylä–mäki which sits in the bay at the top of mainland Obor, is the greatest peak in the country, standing at roughly 13 miles high. Deep within it are the entranceways to the Underworld and giants that make their home there. At its summit, a @UUID[.0ru8kn3zml6fAvTq#frost]{frost giant} observatory sits, watching the skies for the celestial conjunction that will signal ”The Beginning of the End”. This is either a time when all people will come together to live harmoniously, or is the first in a series of cataclysmic events that will trigger the implosion of Obor and its neighbouring lands. Unfortunately, the frost giants aren’t certain which it is that is going to happen. Outside of Obor, it is known as ”High Tor”.</p><h2>Keha and Kaari</h2><p>Off the northern shore are Keha and Kaari (the Ring and the Arc). These islands were formed when debris from the falling ”Shard of the Sun” landed and caused the seabed to rise up above the level of the surface in some places. The islands are often used by @UUID[.0ru8kn3zml6fAvTq#merrow]{merrow} as resting places if, for example, storms become too rough, or they are meeting non-giants for, for example, trading purposes. The islands are riddled with caves and narrow inlets, making currents around them treacherous. Giant pirates operate from here. The islands are also rather gem-rich, as the heat from their creation caused much of the raised seabed to turn to gems, but getting them is difficult.</p><h2>Taivas Tasanko</h2><p>There is a huge mesa plateau, Taivas Tasanko, on a disputed bulge of land that is almost surrounded by Klavek, roughly in the middle of that country’s southern border. The mesa is over three miles high and just about 400 miles in circumference, taking up the whole of the ”bulge”. The wall enclosing Obor is even built around the base of the mesa, to ensure continuity. This is where Pappi and Salainen first stepped on the planet, and is still the first stepping stone for all the apulainen when they visit. On the top of the plateau is a martial monastery and place of worship, Luostari. Every giant race is represented here, although it is not an “equal” place; for example, currently the @UUID[.0ru8kn3zml6fAvTq#athach]{athachs} are camped on the roof, whilst the @UUID[.0ru8kn3zml6fAvTq#merrow]{merrow} have to change their representatives every few days due to the lack of water.</p><h2>Raja Linnoitus</h2><p>The entire southern sea border of Obor is one huge military and governmental administrative building called Raja Linnoitus. This building, built entire for giant-sized occupants, is where anyone visiting Obor is officially allowed to enter. Anyone found in the country without the required paperwork issued from this place has just one chance to be taken into custodial care or will be executed on the spot. The giants are very particular about this. Only two groups – all @UUID[JournalEntry.QlctNkzE9injOde9.JournalEntryPage.lMtTJxWecu1ISdP0]{gnomes} from @UUID[JournalEntry.2cK9lISUylZwk24i]{Pradjna}, and @UUID[JournalEntry.QlctNkzE9injOde9.JournalEntryPage.ei36LjIhEoh87vgE]{elves} who are residents of the Elgres islands – are exempt.</p><h2>The southern border</h2><p>The southern border with the Scorched Lands, and western borders with the unclaimed territories and Pradjna, all have a series of airboat platforms every 50 miles along the protective wall. These towers are roughly half a mile high, with the only landing platform at the top and just one exit at the base. When the Pradjna gnomes helped the giants build the defensive wall around the whole country, the giants gave the gnomes the details of how to make the flying citadels that storm giants use. The gnomes developed airboats for both themselves and the giants, and requested that safe stations be placed on the joint border. These airboats are prized items, in particular those built for giants, and are defended at all costs. Any non-giant or non-gnome in possession of one will find that they receive constant requests to sell it, often for overly-large sums. Neither the giants nor the gnomes like them falling into the hands of other races.</p><h2>Kadotettu</h2><p>Off the coast of the Vast Swamp, towards its northern border with the Scorched Lands, Obor has ownership of an island, Kadotettu, which is the place where the titans left for other realms. It is unclear whether the loss of the titans from the giant population is considered a good or bad state of affairs; the titans were insisting on being allowed a stronger influence over the entire giant population just before their departure, a situation that was causing internal rifts throughout the rest of the @UUID[.bUzRK3wWLJPr3eIJ#obri]{Obri}. Eventually the titans’ request was refused and they left, which brought about a return to internal stability and a golden age when the rest of giantkind took significant strides forward. Kadotettu is now inhabited by a force of @UUID[.0ru8kn3zml6fAvTq#trolls]{trolls}, land-based and aquatic, that protects the ancient titan departure site from treasure hunters and glory-seekers. These trolls are all extremely experienced druids, rangers and sorcerers, for whom the service of guarding the island is one of great honour.</p><h2>Jattaltia</h2><p>At the southern end of the @UUID[JournalEntry.wVQiwLZtRuaqbpFA]{Silent Forest}, in a bay close to @UUID[JournalEntry.oVgfVPmxlNXfN3CW]{Timaeus} and a little further out to sea, Obor has sovereignty of a group of six islands called the Jattaltia. It is here that the ogre-elf clans, the Elgres in Common tongue, live; careful selective matchmaking continues to produce exemplary children who are trained to become the outward-facing elite of Obor. Korkein Esimerkki, 20th-Level Expert, is currently the main contact any of the other races have with Obor (except the gnomes of Pradjna) and he is a member of a prominent Jattaltia family that can trace its mixed lineage back for over 350 generations. These islands are almost identical in nature to the Silent Forest, yet most structures are giant-sized. They also each have an airboat docking tower.</p></div>","markdown":""},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{"core":{"sheetClass":"core.JournalTextPageSheet"}}}],"flags":{"cf":{"id":null},"core":{"sourceId":"Compendium.Aventyr-Campaign-Setting.aventyr-campaign.CZklpkirPVkYlgVp"},"scene-packer":{"hash":"fdd58e3603cfda298b3fd31731d921c0b1350b56"}},"_stats":{"systemId":"dnd5e","systemVersion":"2.1.4","coreVersion":"10.291","createdTime":1664018841723,"modifiedTime":1674975191536,"lastModifiedBy":"EsIYTtNnjwxUbKOG"},"_id":"CZklpkirPVkYlgVp","ownership":{"default":0,"R5IsvMTH5P79pBoG":3},"folder":"j9cXBagzZ1ARsO2I","sort":200000},{"name":"Picollo","pages":[{"sort":200000,"name":"Picollo","type":"text","_id":"Fo8ZyJ0HbBDVVALU","title":{"show":false,"level":1},"image":{},"text":{"format":1,"content":"<div class=\"aventyr\">\n<p class=\"s5\">Picollo</p>\n<img style=\"display:block;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto\" src=\"modules/aaw-games-aventyr/Setting-images/Picollo-map-750x277.webp\" width=\"496\" height=\"246\" /></div>\n<div class=\"aventyr\"> </div>\n<div class=\"aventyr\"><img style=\"float:right;margin:0px 15px 15px 0px;border:0px\" src=\"modules/aaw-games-aventyr/Setting-images/halfling-bosun-copy.webp\" width=\"204\" height=\"287\" />\n<p>Two hundred miles off the southern tip of @UUID[JournalEntry.oVgfVPmxlNXfN3CW]{Timaeus} lay the island nation of Picollo. Once an archipelago stretching deep into the southern ocean, much of its ancient lands were destroyed in the Great Schism, crushed by the falling body of the Dracoprime. Only the big island and a few scattered isles survived the cataclysm some 500 years ago, and since the disaster, the peoples and culture of @UUID[JournalEntry.QlctNkzE9injOde9.JournalEntryPage.myrc4omqUaiD3RKZ]{Halfling} society have struggled for their very survival, some might say for their very souls.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Ancient Picollo was first and foremost a peaceful realm of farmers, drinkers, and enjoyers of all the good stuff that life has to offer. Halflings were simple and open people, finding beauty in all the blessings that the gods placed upon their island homes. @UUID[.Gv1vyttllOYQaK2t#mainland-picollo-–-the-big-island]{Mainland Picollo – The Big Island} was covered in green rolling farmlands, save for the @UUID[.Gv1vyttllOYQaK2t#the-great-mountain]{The Great Mountain} in the north, and @UUID[.Gv1vyttllOYQaK2t#the-great-forest]{The Great Forest}to the west. The isles of the archipelago provided a diversity of agricultural products and stimulated halfling naval architecture and maritime trade; in its heyday, the merchant fleets of Picollo traded with most of Aventyr, and trading enclaves from other nations were common on the big island. Many of these grew into larger towns and cities, in contrast to halfling settlements, which remained centered on village life.</p>\n<p>The destruction of the Great Schism changed the face of Picollo forever. The two hundred years following the cataclysm were consumed by efforts to survive and rebuild, but just as the land and people started to recover, @UUID[JournalEntry.QlctNkzE9injOde9.JournalEntryPage.SGw7zGFtvjLNPDMY]{Hoyrall} burst onto the scene. For two centuries the aliens tunnelled inside the great mountain, and then to other parts of Aventyr through the caverns and tunnels of the Underworld that intersected with the new construction. Hives that remained behind launched a full scale invasion of the halfling lands—the invading force wiped out halfling villages everywhere they went, colonizing the land and setting up new hives like mindless drones. The only diplomacy they engaged in was to strip away the alliances of the human settlements in Picollo; the twicelings thought themselves safe but when the ties were cut, the hoyrall broke their agreements and turned, destroying them utterly.</p>\n<p>The remaining halflings took to the forest and isolated slopes of the great mountain. Stealth, trickery, and valiant assaults kept the sorely pressed halflings from being completely overrun, but it was the Confluence and breaking of the hoyrall hive-mind that allowed them to make headway against the invaders. The halflings joined forces with the fey of the great forest and the @UUID[JournalEntry.QlctNkzE9injOde9.JournalEntryPage.t4LZuyNruvzneOHD]{Dwarf} of @UUID[.Gv1vyttllOYQaK2t#stoneroot]{Stoneroot}, wiping their land clean of the insectoid invaders.</p>\n<p>Recovery has been slow; @UUID[JournalEntry.QlctNkzE9injOde9.JournalEntryPage.myrc4omqUaiD3RKZ]{Halfling} tribes returned to their homes to find everything their ancestors had built completely destroyed. They had to start from scratch and build anew. Though once drawn together by a common enemy, despair and exhaustion has taken its toll. In ancient times, nearby villages often joined together to accomplish greater projects than they could alone: now, the rebuilding of Picollo is insular and clannish. Desperate for labor but wary of other humanoids, indentured servitude has been introduced across the island for would-be immigrants. Travelers to these lands find scant welcome and are carefully watched, spied upon by night. Most visitors rarely travel further than the coastal ports due to the @UUID[.PmrSWZmvMcJz6g4H#xenophobia]{Xenophobia} in Picollan villages. Any non-halfling in the interior is assumed to be an @UUID[.PmrSWZmvMcJz6g4H#indentured-servitude]{Indentured Servitude}, or perhaps a freedman who has completed his term of service.</p>\n<p>Modern halflings pay lip service to the merry and celebratory traditions of ancient times, and the end of the wars means that the traditional festivals are once again being celebrated, but there is a darker shadow now to their people, an untrustworthy part. This is the part that forges secret pacts, creates thieves guilds, and negotiates dark deals in an effort to protect the halfling way of life and prevent outsiders from again invading or betraying their kin.</p>\n</div>","markdown":""},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{"core":{"sheetClass":""}}},{"sort":300000,"name":"History","type":"text","_id":"fP5CHtZClE3BVaIe","title":{"show":false,"level":2},"image":{},"text":{"format":1,"content":"<div class=\"aventyr\">\n<p class=\"s5\">History</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Circa -6,000:</strong> Primitive halflings once watched over by the fey of the @UUID[.Gv1vyttllOYQaK2t#the-great-forest]{The Great Forest} begin to develop agriculture, primarily to raise domestic crops of barley for beer, honey for mead, and pipeweed.

Its decrees and proclamations have only the force of recommendations to the villages throughout Picollo with the single exception of matters relating to indentured servitude and freedman colonies—both of which are strictly regulated throughout Picollo.</span></span></p><p style=\"box-sizing:border-box;user-select:text;margin:0.5em 0px;min-height:1rem\"><span style=\"font-family:Signika, sans-serif\"><span style=\"font-family:Signika, sans-serif\">The First Speaker, along with an advisory board of four Second Speakers, runs the meetings throughout the year and manages a professional team of scribes and servants that record the events in assembly. The First Speaker is elected every spring from amongst the elders present during the Festival of Renewal and receives a stipend to cover all costs of the administration (as well as his own personal living expenses) from funds collected at the close of each debate—some unpopular Speakers are reduced to penury when the donations dry up. Bribery within the Eldermoot is almost unheard of as most of the edicts of the Eldermoot have little force in law.</span></span></p><h3><span style=\"font-family:Signika, sans-serif\"><span style=\"font-family:Signika, sans-serif\">Board of Indentures and the Council of Freedmen</span></span></h3><p><span style=\"font-family:Signika, sans-serif\"><span style=\"font-family:Signika, sans-serif\">Since the introduction of @UUID[.PmrSWZmvMcJz6g4H#indentured-servitude]{indentured} servitude in Picollo some six cycles of servants have served their terms and achieved freedman status—many thousands more are serving out their indentureship. Responsible for the legislation and regulation of both indentured servitude and freedman rights, ten halfling elders sit on the Board of Indentures. The original ten elders were elected by the @UUID[.X0uyBqIKLevC15mx#the-eldermoot]{Eldermoot;} currently election to the board is the prerogative of the Council of Freedmen. The appointment is for life and the council has had the opportunity to elect only four replacements in the last fifty years. With these younger fellows, the six original members enjoy their venerable years dominating the most politically influential group in Picollo.</span></span></p><p><span style=\"font-family:Signika, sans-serif\"><span style=\"font-family:Signika, sans-serif\">The Council of Freedmen consists of seven freedmen serving the interests of both freedmen and indentures throughout Picollo. Its representatives are chosen not by the freedmen themselves, but by the Eldermoot at the same time as the speakers. A councillor serves a single term of seven years, and the terms are staggered so that a new councillor replaces a retiring one every year. The most powerful influence the council retains is the election of a member to the Board of Indentures, but as this opportunity comes rarely, one could argue how much influence actually resides within the prerogative.</span></span></p><p><span style=\"font-family:Signika, sans-serif\"><span style=\"font-family:Signika, sans-serif\">The council sits in the Eldermoot seven days out of every ten, but is granted the right to speak only on the first and last day of each cycle (the Right of Voice). The council usually meets in private during the three-day banishment, when the Eldermoot (advised by the Board of Indentures) is free to discuss freedman issues without prying ears.</span></span></p><p><span style=\"font-family:Signika, sans-serif\"><span style=\"font-family:Signika, sans-serif\">Legislation regarding freedman and indentured rights may only be proposed by members of the Board of Indentures, although freedman councillors can speak to the issue when they have the Right of Voice. Freedmen councillors also vote on proposed legislation. Passing, amending, or abolishing a law requires a majority vote on both the Board and the Council.</span></span></p><p><span style=\"font-family:Signika, sans-serif\"><span style=\"font-family:Signika, sans-serif\">Unlike election to the Eldermoot, bribery is commonplace in the Council of Freedmen and within the Board of Indentures. Members of both bodies are courted by conservative and progressive villages in regards to indentured rights, and having a tame freedman councillor or a friendly ear on the Board can be useful.</span></span></p><h3><span style=\"font-family:Signika, sans-serif\"><span style=\"font-family:Signika, sans-serif\">Guilds and Secret Societies</span></span></h3><p><span style=\"font-family:Signika, sans-serif\"><span style=\"font-family:Signika, sans-serif\">Though not part of formal government, Picollo is rife with guilds, collectives, and secret societies.

Gone are the days of bucolic, carefree attitudes and the joy of discovery. The traditional (and often religious) ties of family and community are threatened by an increasing reliance on deal making and practicality. Some families and villages long to return to the ancient traditions, but modern halflings have scant experience with them, save tales of days long past. Most halflings attempt to live a life of tradition as evidenced in these tales, but the agrarian, village-centric life only masks a deeper and more cynical pragmatism.</p>\n<h2>Xenophobia</h2>\n<p>Due to their enslavement during the Hoyrall Wars and betrayal by humanoid settlements in their lands, halflings have become very protective of each other. This protection manifests in different ways; at a very young age all halflings are taught to help one another regardless of their moral standing or ulterior motives. As they grow to maturity, however, halflings begin to realize that they have survived in part due to a darker heritage, one of suspicion and mistrust. This heritage is the one that forges secret pacts, thieves guilds, and dark deals to protect the halfling way of life and prevent outsiders from again betraying or invading their lands. Even with this dark shadow, it is taboo for one halfling to kill another even under dire circumstances—those that do face banishment.</p>\n<p>Halflings of mainland Picollo (and the Isles) do regard the @UUID[JournalEntry.QlctNkzE9injOde9.JournalEntryPage.RTYoyteEKY7EOhy2]{Dweorg}of Stonehelm as worthy allies, as well as the fey of the @UUID[.Gv1vyttllOYQaK2t#the-great-forest]{Great Forest}. Only a scattering of halfling mages and the highlanders of the @UUID[.Gv1vyttllOYQaK2t#the-great-mountain]{great mountain} regard the @UUID[JournalEntry.QlctNkzE9injOde9.JournalEntryPage.MsDyrandNiqdPIrd]{Zwerc} of Cloudwalk as trustworthy.</p>\n<p>Halfling exiles (descended from those who fled Picollo and settled in greater Aventyr rather than those banished for murder) are more accepting of other races, and have held to the ancient traditions; as such, they are often misunderstood or mistrusted by those from Picollo itself.</p>\n<h2>Indentured Servitude</h2>\n<p>Ironically (in the face of their previous enslavement by the @UUID[JournalEntry.QlctNkzE9injOde9.JournalEntryPage.SGw7zGFtvjLNPDMY]{Hoyrall}), the halfling peoples have adopted a policy of indentured servitude for would-be immigrants of other races to their lands. In desperate need of labor to rebuild, halfling merchants often collect the downtrodden and out-of-luck across Aventyr to ship home and bind to a seven-year term of service. Not only does this provide additional labor and hard coin for the merchant captains who ply the seas, some halflings believe a term of service will teach those of other races the value of loyalty.</p>\n<h2>Religion</h2>\n<img style=\"float:right;margin:0px 15px 15px 0px;border:0px\" src=\"modules/aaw-games-aventyr/Setting-images/Great-Mother.webp\" width=\"195\" height=\"280\" />\n<p>Worship of @UUID[JournalEntry.dOJJ8mRNTPtoihmF.JournalEntryPage.7JZLaCukpLMqn2R2]{The Mother Spirit} still pervades halfling culture and has spread to other lands by way of the many exiles residing across Aventyr. Villages are centered around the Holy Tree of of the central green where communal worship is held. The pressures and loss of the Hoyrall Wars have undermined the tenets of community espoused by the Great Mother however, and a village religious leader is as often as not to be a “@UUID[JournalEntry.dOJJ8mRNTPtoihmF.JournalEntryPage.7JZLaCukpLMqn2R2#fallen-leaf-cleric]{Fallen Leaf cleric}”, not through any evil or heretical design, but simply through an erosion of the ancient understandings.

The great temples to the elemental aspects of the Mother Spirit were destroyed or abandoned after the Great Schism, and most of the knowledge was lost over the past five centuries.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n</div>","markdown":""},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{"core":{"sheetClass":""}}},{"sort":700000,"name":"Geography","type":"text","_id":"Gv1vyttllOYQaK2t","title":{"show":false,"level":1},"image":{},"text":{"format":1,"content":"<div class=\"aventyr\"><p class=\"s5\">Geography</p><h2>Settlements</h2><p>Most halfling villages contain less than 200 inhabitants, with fewer than fifteen percent being indentured servants, although a few small towns on the coast that specialize in maritime commerce can grow 5 to 6 times as large and contain a more non-halflings.

Fey communities in the @UUID[.Gv1vyttllOYQaK2t#the-great-forest]{Great Forest} tend to reach populations of between 100 and 200, similar to their halfling friends. A few collectives of freedmen have begun to take shape across the landscape of Picollo, but strict land ownership laws have stunted the growth of such communities. Most freedmen remain part of the village in which they served their @UUID[.PmrSWZmvMcJz6g4H#indentured-servitude]{indentureship}.</p><h2>Mainland Picollo – The Big Island</h2><p>Mainland Picollo lies 200 miles south of @UUID[JournalEntry.oVgfVPmxlNXfN3CW]{Timaeus} and encompasses an area close to 900 miles in length. The big island is 400 miles wide at its widest point. At the northern end of the island, the weather is temperate and the Great Mountain rises seven miles to its peak. The western side of the island sports the Great Forest, while the eastern side is made up of rolling farmlands in the interior and deepwater ports on the coast. The fractured southern tip of the island still bears the scars of the Great Schism, and overland travel is difficult in the sub-tropical climate of the south due to the number of fresh and brackish waterways permeating the broken landscape.</p><h3>The Nines</h3><p>LN large town</p><p><strong>Corruption:</strong> +0; <strong>Crime:</strong> +0; <strong>Economy:</strong> +2; <strong>Law:</strong> +1; <strong>Lore:</strong> +0; <strong>Society:</strong> +3</p><p><strong>Qualities:</strong> rumormongering citizens, strategic location, tourist attraction</p><p><strong>Danger:</strong> +5</p><p>DEMOGRAPHICS</p><p><strong>Government:</strong> council</p><p><strong>Population:</strong> 4,750 (3,500 @UUID[JournalEntry.QlctNkzE9injOde9.JournalEntryPage.myrc4omqUaiD3RKZ]{Halfling}; 30 @UUID[JournalEntry.QlctNkzE9injOde9.JournalEntryPage.RTYoyteEKY7EOhy2]{Dweorg}, 200 freedmen humans, 20 freedman other, 900@UUID[.PmrSWZmvMcJz6g4H#indentured-servitude]{ indentured} humans; 100 indentured others)</p><p><strong>Notable NPCs</strong></p><p><strong>Eseld Penberry, First Speaker</strong> (LN Female halfling aristocrat 9)</p><p><strong>Wren Machek, Freedman Councillor</strong> (NE Male human expert 8/warrior 3)</p><p><strong>@UUID[.D1IrajgFIr9gyZFw#jory-tremorgan]{Jory Tremorgan}, Historian</strong> (NG Male halfling wizard 5/expert 7)</p><p>MARKETPLACE</p><p><strong>Base Value:</strong> 2,600 gp; <strong>Purchase Limit:</strong> 10,000 gp; <strong>Spellcasting:</strong> 5th</p><p><strong>Minor Items:</strong> [[/roll 3d4]]; <strong>Medium Items:</strong> [[/roll 2d4]]; Major Items [[/roll 1d4]]</p><p>Located at the mouth of the Marigold river, the nine villages that host the @UUID[.X0uyBqIKLevC15mx#the-eldermoot]{Eldermoot}, @UUID[.X0uyBqIKLevC15mx#board-of-indentures-and-the-council-of-freedmen]{Board of Indentures}, and the@UUID[.X0uyBqIKLevC15mx#board-of-indentures-and-the-council-of-freedmen]{ Council of Freedmen} consist of a deepwater port, milling villages along the river, fishing villages up and down the coast, and farming villages, all within half a day’s travel of each other. Individually, the deepwater port of Culloden and the government seat of Scrivenston would be considered small towns, but the symbiotic relationship of all nine settlements together creates a stronger municipal collective.</p><p>Not included in the name (but certainly in the population count) is a tenth settlement, the freedman colony of Rivercross. Situated across the river from Scrivenston, this village of some 120 souls contains some of the wealthiest freedmen in Picollo. Many owe their riches to a term of service on the Council of Freedmen (with its attendant bribes) and some retain considerable political influence. A few of the freedmen in Rivercross keep indentures of their own, and in general indentures and freedmen from other colonies across Picollo hate those who dwell within and all that Rivercross stands for: the perpetuation of the injustices of the halflings’ “peculiar institution”.</p><p></p><h2>The Isles</h2><p>The ancient archipelago once consisted of thousands of smaller islands stretching three thousand miles to the southwest. Only a handful survived the tectonic disturbances and tidal waves that accompanied the fall of the Dracoprime; the highest concentration of these islands are within 300 miles of the southern tip of the big island. The islands vary in habitability from the uninhabited desert island to tropical paradises; the warming ocean currents of the south flow east to west off the southern tip of mainland Picollo. Clans and villages of seaborn halflings are sometimes found on these islands. The most dangerous stretch of the sea is known as the Spine of the Dragon, where the vertebrae of the Dracoprime pierces the surface of the ocean, creating vicious currents and putting ships at hazard.</p><h2>The Great Mountain</h2><p>The base of the mountain is over 100 miles in diameter, surrounded by rolling hills. No other peaks compete with the seven-mile high summit; the mass that is the Great Mountain is unique. Many valleys and rises, both forested and grassy, lie sheltered on the great slopes of the mountain and alluvial rivers cascade off cliffsides, running swiftly through these vales. The civilized races on the mountain include the @UUID[JournalEntry.QlctNkzE9injOde9.JournalEntryPage.RTYoyteEKY7EOhy2]{Dweorg} at the base in their city of @UUID[.Gv1vyttllOYQaK2t#stoneroot]{Stoneroot}, highland halfling clans on the slopes, and @UUID[JournalEntry.QlctNkzE9injOde9.JournalEntryPage.MsDyrandNiqdPIrd]{Zwerc} cloud fortresses near the peak. Monsters and tribes of monstrous humanoids (as well as some giants) live in the many hidden valleys of the mountain; some have even taken over the old @UUID[JournalEntry.QlctNkzE9injOde9.JournalEntryPage.SGw7zGFtvjLNPDMY]{Hoyrall} tunnels that riddle portions of the Great Mountain’s interior (though hoyrall have not been seen on the slopes or in the tunnels of the Great Mountain since the end of the wars.) An amber road runs from deep within the bones of the mountain to its peak, guarded by the dweorgs of Stonehelm and the zwerc in the clouds above.</p><h3>Stoneroot</h3><p>LN small city</p><p><strong>Corruption:</strong> +-1; <strong>Crime:</strong> +1; <strong>Economy:</strong> +4; <strong>Law:</strong> +2; <strong>Lore:</strong> -1; <strong>Society:</strong> +6</p><p><strong>Qualities:</strong> holy site, prosperous, strategic location, tourist attraction</p><p><strong>Danger:</strong> +5</p><p>DEMOGRAPHICS</p><p><strong>Government:</strong> council</p><p><strong>Population:</strong> 8,850 (7,000 @UUID[JournalEntry.QlctNkzE9injOde9.JournalEntryPage.RTYoyteEKY7EOhy2]{Dweorg}; 500 @UUID[JournalEntry.QlctNkzE9injOde9.JournalEntryPage.myrc4omqUaiD3RKZ]{Halfling}; 1,000 humans (freedmen); 100 @UUID[.PmrSWZmvMcJz6g4H#indentured-servitude]{indentured} humans; 250 other)</p><p><strong>Notable NPCs</strong></p><p><strong>Rogan Hardamber, Dwarven Council</strong> (LN Male dweorg fighter 9)</p><p><strong>Rory Bessamer, Freedman Demagogue</strong> (CN Male human bard 7)</p><p><strong>@UUID[.D1IrajgFIr9gyZFw#elerin-crosseyes]{Elerin Crosseyes}, Merchant</strong> (LN Female halfling expert 10)</p><p>MARKETPLACE</p><p><strong>Base Value:</strong> 6,400 gp; <strong>Purchase Limit:</strong> 37,250 gp; <strong>Spellcasting:</strong> 8th</p><p><strong>Minor Items:</strong> [[/roll 4d4]]; <strong>Medium Items:</strong> [[/roll 3d4]]; <strong>Major Items:</strong> [[/roll 1d6]]</p><p>The city of Stoneroot is carved into walls of a great sea cavern at the base of the Great Mountain on the eastern shore of mainland Picollo. The size of the entrance to the cave as well as a great underground river allows a significant amount of maritime trade to pass through the city, and the dweorg keep a harbor fleet of galleys for defense. Tunnels and avenues lead to the surface, as well as deeper into the mountain itself.</p><p>The dweorg are excellent smiths; magical arms and armor under the base price are more likely to be available in Stoneroot (85%), but staves, rings, wands, rods, and wondrous items are less likely to be available (65%). Most such items are brokered by halfling middlemen who represent zwerc mages from the cloud fortresses above, or on the black market, due to the friction between dweorg and zwerc. Scrolls and potions can be found normally.</p><p>The non-dweorg population of Stoneroot consists of halfling diplomats, merchants, and craftsmen, and their indentured servants (the dweorg do not keep indentures), as well as freedmen. Many abolitionist societies use this city as a base of operations, due to the more egalitarian government of the dwarves.</p><h2>The Great Forest</h2><p>One of the last bastions of resistance during the wars, the Great Forest suffered the least damage from the @UUID[JournalEntry.QlctNkzE9injOde9.JournalEntryPage.SGw7zGFtvjLNPDMY]{Hoyrall} invaders. Though some portions of the perimeter suffered depredation, the interior maintains its primaeval characteristics, guarded and husbanded by the fey living within. Magical and mystical creatures also share the virgin woodland; not all are friendly. In addition to the fey living in the woods, villages of tree-borer halflings can also be found, as well as the scattered humanoid settlements of runaway indentures and independently inclined freedmen.</p><p>The Great Oak of the Mother is located somewhere in the Great Forest. In ancient times, holy druids transplanted acorns from the tree to the central greens of many halfling communities. Only a few of these “Second Growth” trees survive; they are among the most powerful foci of divine magic on the island.

A hero may be the exception to the rule, but will never let other races know the secrets of their homeland. Elves live for thousands of years and have an inner-wisdom of the natural world that humans will never attain. They are aloof and secretive and generally keep to themselves. The majority of elves live within the protective confines of the @UUID[JournalEntry.wVQiwLZtRuaqbpFA]{Silent Forest} to the south of the @UUID[JournalEntry.QVrlu0lTv2vFtT5P]{Klavek Kingdom}. The Silent Forest is a magical place where humans are forbidden, and those who have ventured into the forest never return. An elf cannot willingly give up the secrets of her homeland even if tortured, magically manipulated, or even psionically attacked. Most elves choose either the path of magic or nature and given the seemingly endless life they are gifted, excel marvellously in either.</p>\n<h2>The Vast Swamp</h2>\n<p>Magic is used by the Black Gold Consortium to speed up extraction and enhance the efficiency of its workers, tasks excelled at by elven mages and alchemists—it spends a hefty sum to these scholars if they can provide results. Elves reluctantly take the money for their services but their true reasons for inhabiting the area remain hidden from the Black Gold Consortium. The elves’ love of nature is always paramount and the reason why they are truly working with them is to see that the business does not damage the ecosystem of the swamp. Magic means of extraction are cleaner and less damaging to the area, and there are whispers of a secret order of elven saboteurs who work towards stopping any forms of extraction that the elves do not approve of.

Large portions of their island home of @UUID[JournalEntry.PCe82J4UbHQWFYYL]{Picollo} far to the southeast remain uninhabited. Enclaves of exiles across the breadth and width of Aventyr have exposed many nations and races to the existence of halflings, but many isolated folks often perceive them as children or humans of stunted growth.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Halflings bear scant trust for the other races of Aventyr, especially humans, whom they view as feckless and faithless. Halflings from exiled backgrounds are more likely to be trusting of non-halflings and tend to hold more true to the ancient ways and happy-go-lucky traditions of halfling society. Those whose families suffered during the @UUID[.SGw7zGFtvjLNPDMY]{Hoyrall} Wars and enslavement are more prone to pragmatism. This practical outlook has begun to erode the traditional paths of fellowship and community. Though fragile, a bond does still remain between all halflings; it is taboo for one halfling to kill another even under dire circumstances; those that do face banishment. When banding together in groups halflings are a force to be reckoned with.</p>\n<h2>Vast Swamp</h2>\n<p>Halflings are often called upon when the Black Gold Consortium needs something done in a tight spot. Small folk can often find employment cleaning or fixing in-between the cogs of extraction centers, or removing blockages in tall chimneys or long pipes; the work is always dangerous, so they expect to be paid well. The Neliton family is one of the core families in the consortium and in charge of halfling relations in @UUID[JournalEntry.g4odaMsHbRkeNFhn.JournalEntryPage.Tdkqx23iD22AVlLv]{Cherrian’s Rest}. The family’s easy going nature has protected them from the internal conflicts of the consortium—they love to show off their strong sense of fashion. The Nelitons are the trendsetting family of the Consortium, often wearing the finest garments and jewels just to show off their lavishness and to invoke the jealousy of the other families.</p>\n<h2>Subtypes</h2>\n<h3>Seaborn</h3>\n<p>Most of the of the archipelago that made up greater @UUID[JournalEntry.PCe82J4UbHQWFYYL]{Picollo}was buried under the sea when the Dracoprime fell in the Great Schism, but scattered isles remain. Some halflings spend their whole lives on ships traveling between these isles, mainland Picollo, and the rest of Aventyr. While they feel bonds of kinship to all halflings, their ties to their shipmates are the closest. Years of fighting wind and wave have taught them caution, and that discretion is often the better part of valor.</p>\n<h3>Highlanders</h3>\n<p>On the @UUID[JournalEntry.PCe82J4UbHQWFYYL.JournalEntryPage.Gv1vyttllOYQaK2t#the-great-mountain]{The Great Mountain}, the highland halflings were in the thickest fighting during the @UUID[.SGw7zGFtvjLNPDMY]{Hoyrall} Wars as the insect-like race spewed forth from the tunnels and chambers riddling the great peak. Alliances with the @UUID[.RTYoyteEKY7EOhy2]{dweorg} at the base of the mountain and the @UUID[.MsDyrandNiqdPIrd]{zwerc} its top provided arms and armor and magic during the struggle, and often a place of retreat.</p>\n<h3>Tree-Borers</h3>\n<p>These halfling clans live alongside the fey in @UUID[JournalEntry.PCe82J4UbHQWFYYL.JournalEntryPage.Gv1vyttllOYQaK2t#the-great-forest]{the great forest of Picollo}. They make their homes in living trees, hollowed out with a combination of plant husbandry and fey magic. Endless pranks and tricks played on the halflings by their fey neighbors often have them cursing their luck. The tree-borers took in many refugees during the @UUID[.SGw7zGFtvjLNPDMY]{Hoyrall} Wars, and the final resistance was mounted from within the forest itself.

The Vikmordere had been using @UUID[JournalEntry.ismpCNWpGHvB1iPw]{Rybalka}, a village of tribal fishermen and woodworkers as a base of operations for their attacks on the three Riverside Klavekian villages. The village of Rybalka also works a local iron mine which supplied ore for the Vikmordere weapons and shipbuilding tools.</p>\n<p>  The Klavek Kingdom Monarchy moved troops into the Vikmordere Valley and launched an arduous assault against the Vikmordere in hopes of securing this strategic location and obtaining the lucrative iron mine. After many failed attempts and the death of hundreds of Klavekian ground troops, the Klavek Kingdom was finally able to oust the Vikmordere raiders and take over the small village and local mine. In order to hold the location, additional troops were brought in to clear the mountainside forests of the rest of the Vikmordere warriors which resulted in horrible casualties for the Klavekians. Eventually, almost every Vikmordere in a 15-mile radius was slaughtered. A few Vikmordere survived by hiding in abandoned ruins and mountain caves, which were passed up by the Klavek Kingdom soldiers seeing as it was impossible to follow every possible lead in such a large territory.</p>\n<p>The majority of the Vikmordere people still thrive in the mountains and in the deep recesses of the winding Serpent Lake, waiting for the day when a great Vikmordere champion rises up to lead them to victory and reclamation of their ancestor’s land and the village now called “Rybalka” by the filthy Klavs.</p>\n</div>","markdown":""},"_id":"sPIEyCZy4k35amgs","image":{},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"sort":900000,"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"JournalEntry.aQr9obWamQcmAPUN.JournalEntryPage.wRMpAyePvqRtSHn0"}}},{"name":"Human (Klavekian)","type":"text","title":{"show":false,"level":2},"text":{"format":1,"content":"<div class=\"aventyr\">\n<p class=\"s5\">Human (Klavekian)</p>\n<img style=\"float:left;margin:0px 15px 15px 0px;border:0px\" src=\"modules/aaw-games-aventyr/Races-Images/Klavekian-Human-Male.webp\" width=\"282\" height=\"365\" />\n<p><em> </em></p>\n<p>Klavekians are a hearty steadfast people who have been dealt with impossible odds and found ways to cope.

The limited time available to the undead wizard prevented wide dispersal of the anti-colloid virus, leaving the extraterrestrial sentience puzzled by how any creature can resist its psyche (there is a 1% chance that a PC has been exposed to this otherwise benign virus and is immune to the detrimental effects of the colloid). Colliatur are often found leading the subjects of the colloid—their independence proving to be an attracting force to the alien’s thralls—and may be encountered anywhere in the Underworld or Upperworld.</p>\n<p>   Exploring is a natural impulse for the colliatur, and spreading the message of the alien overmind is their first priority.

They stayed deep beneath the world toiling in their greatest cities, only an echo of their former selves.</p>\n<p><strong>The third </strong>were named the @UUID[.MsDyrandNiqdPIrd]{Zwerc}, created from the spirits of the Dvergr. This granted them innate power over magic, their mystical nature making them loners and travelers with an endless thirst for knowledge.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The potent avarice of the Dvergr, however, would not be undone by the gods—traveling far from the deific crafting, the very essence of their greed delved deep into Aventyr, much deeper than the gods had permitted the Dvergr to go. Soon they had discovered HEL—where devils and demons dwell—and while the first three races were created, a pact was forged with the denizens there. The devils granted the Dvergr’s avarice physical form and realms in the deepest, most foul and flaming depths of the Underworld—but they did not stop there. The devils gave the @UUID[.Atn2VIF5a1D1uJUZ]{Gitwerc} the ability to siphon souls from the other races to feed themselves, and in turn they granted the Gitwerc more power.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>When the gods returned to forge the fourth, they found the Dvergr’s entrails snatched up by devils who had turned them into a terrible creature, the Gitwerc.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The gods, realizing their mistake in creating a race with no evil intent, vowed never to do so again and went to work creating the fifth race in secret, using all the remaining parts of the Dvergr. The fifth and final race would be eloquent, honorable, knowledgeable, and nearly immortal, yet the race would be forever divided, torn between light and darkness. Their souls were permanently bound to the world, sentenced with a nearly endless life staring out upon the sea of eternity, never able to attain that balance which comes so easy to the other races. The gods placed this race above and below the world, both in light and in darkness; they became the @UUID[.ei36LjIhEoh87vgE]{Elves} and the @UUID[.8HyVcZ70eyhwNJsu]{Drow}.</p>\n<p>     Then the gods did something which surprised all of the races.

In the past, Vikmordere raiders used the strategic location of the fishing village as a launching point for attacks against the @UUID[JournalEntry.QVrlu0lTv2vFtT5P]{Klavek Kingdom}. An abundant iron mine nearby provided all the ore the Vikmordere raiders needed for their tools, weapons, and armor.</p>\n<p>The Klavekian Monarchy moved troops into the @UUID[JournalEntry.Cg0Nt8mDPQ7JrmyB]{Vikmordere Valley} and launched an arduous assault against the Vikmordere in hopes of securing this strategic location and obtaining the lucrative iron mine. After many failed attempts and the deaths of hundreds of Klavekian ground troops, the Klavek Kingdom was finally able to oust the Vikmordere raiders from Rybalka. In order to hold the location, additional troops were brought in to clear the mountainside forests of the rest of the Vikmordere warriors. This resulted in horrible casualties for the Klavekians, losing 10 soldiers for every 1 Vikmordere raider found and killed. Many of the Vikmordere avoided persecution by hiding in abandoned ruins and mountain caves where it is thought they still exist to this day.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<img style=\"display:block;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto\" src=\"modules/aaw-games-aventyr/Setting-images/Serpent-Lake-Map-Todd-Gamble.png\" width=\"650\" height=\"571\" />\n<p> </p>\n<img style=\"float:right;margin:0px 15px 15px 0px;border:0px\" title src=\"modules/aaw-games-aventyr/Setting-images/Klavekian-Warrior-Nestor-the-Dragon-480x579.webp\" width=\"272\" height=\"328\" />\n<p>The Klavek Kingdom placed a permanent contingent of guardsmen at Rybalka to protect the populace and the vital iron mine.</p>\n<p>Without access to the ore in the mine, the Vikmordere’s military strength and foothold on the region has been greatly reduced.</p>\n<p>Many Rybalkan Vikmordere villagers who were not affiliated with the raiders were allowed to stay and live freely in the village if they continued to provide services to the Klavek Kingdom settlers. These services include blacksmithing, fishing, mining, and ship construction as well as various menial tasks requested from time to time. Racism in Rybalka is still quite prevalent, especially amongst the Klavekian settlers, and a few interracial families that were harassed and persecuted by the Klavekians moved into the dangerous and unforgiving wilderness just to escape the ignorance and hatred of the average Klavekian settler.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<img style=\"display:block;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto\" src=\"modules/aaw-games-aventyr/Setting-images/Rybalka-close-up-750x465.webp\" width=\"607\" height=\"423\" />\n<h2>Fishing</h2>\n<p>Rybalka has established a very lucrative trade with the other towns and cities in the @UUID[JournalEntry.QVrlu0lTv2vFtT5P]{Klavek homeland}. The rare mountain fish caught in the @UUID[.Erya8w29cRTTJELu]{Serpent Lake} are highly coveted in the metropolitan areas of the Klavek Kingdom.</p>\n<h2>Logging</h2>\n<p>Two logging camps exist on the Rybalkan Peninsula. The most prominent of these is a @UUID[.mGX47vjQ83yO2l2T#logging]{small logging camp} which exists in the forested hills west of Rybalka. The camp contains two outbuildings, a smithy, and logging equipment. A water flume redirects water from a stream in the hills into the camp to turn a mill-blade and operate saws. Trees are harvested and transported out of the hills and into the great glacial lake. The logs are then loaded on a barge to float down Serpent Lake to the Serpent Tail River and into the waiting hands of the Klavek riverside settlements below.</p>\n<h2>Mining</h2>\n<p>The heavily fortified Rybalkan Mine is northeast of Rybalka. The iron mine imports/exports directly with the Klavekian Monarchy and does not fall under Rybalkan jurisdiction despite its close proximity. The mined ore is shipped via replica Vikmordere vessels through the @UUID[.Erya8w29cRTTJELu]{Serpent Lake} and Serpent’s Tail River into the Klavek Homeland. The large amounts of ore being pulled from the mine has prompted the Klavek Kingdom to invest additional funding and expansion plans to Rybalka as well as an increase in ground troops to patrol the nearby countryside.</p>\n<h2>Climate</h2>\n<p>The temperature varies considerably depending on the season; summer can be as warm as 65F (18C) and winter can be as cold as 8F (-13C). There is generally snow on the ground from early fall until mid spring, although depending on weather patterns this can change.</p>\n<p>Cold winds tend to rush down out of the mountains in winter and push through the valley and down Serpent Lake into the lowland plains below. In winter much of the lake freezes over completely making travel by boat difficult if not impossible.</p>\n<p>In spring when the snow begins to melt many animals with new offspring venture down to the shores of the Serpent Lake. The surrounding forested hillsides go into full bloom. Spring and summer both display the beauty of the land and the true reason why the locals stay and live in such a harsh environment most of the year.</p>\n<p>The end of summer is a time of feasting and celebration.</p>\n<h2>Everyday Life</h2>\n<p>A Rybalkan day begins as the sun finally reaches high enough in the sky to cast its light over the jagged peaks of the Eastern Mountains. The suns rays hit the crystallized snow cover creating myriad colors; lights begin to dance upon the partially frozen @UUID[.Erya8w29cRTTJELu]{Serpent Lake}. The folk living in the small village begin to stir and go about their daily duties; fishermen push their skiffs over the jagged chunks of ice and into the water, Rybalkan Soldiers gear up for wilderness patrols, and the blacksmith stokes the fire at the smithy.</p>\n<h2>Trades</h2>\n<p>The majority of townsfolk in Rybalka are lumberjacks, miners, or fishermen. The only other trades in Rybalka obtain their roots in the three major professions thus woodworking, blacksmithing, and cooking are the secondary trades.</p>\n<h2>Construction</h2>\n<p>Most of the structures in Rybalka are cabins and constructed of wood harvested from the nearby mountain forest. A few permanent structures like the Rybalka Temple are built from stone.</p>\n<h2>Tradition</h2>\n<p>The entrance to a man’s cabin usually has a large set of antlers hanging directly over the door as a sign of virility. Upon marrying, the wife will traditionally hang small bundles of aromatic herbs from the antlers, along with semi-precious stones placed in specific places upon them using tree sap; these herbs are refreshed by the wife weekly.</p>\n<p>When a married couple gives birth to their first child, they take down the antlers and hang a circular wooden disc carved by a native Vikmordere villager over their front door. The Vikmordere villager blesses the disc and the home to ward away evil spirits and calls upon nature to protect the family. Although new arrivals scoff at this practice (calling it superstitious nonsense) they soon find out the hard way that no protection from the wild land brings evil to your doorstep. Before long even the most hardened in their stance invite a native to show them how to protect their home and family from the evils spawned from the nearby Dark Wood</p>\n<img style=\"display:block;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto\" src=\"modules/aaw-games-aventyr/Setting-images/Village-of-Rybalka-Illustration-by-Todd-Gamble.webp\" width=\"594\" height=\"355\" /></div>","markdown":""},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"sort":0,"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{"monks-enhanced-journal":{"appendix":false},"core":{"sheetClass":""}}},{"name":"Rybalkan Establishments","type":"text","_id":"zpUSPaV4mxOVvVDx","title":{"show":false,"level":1},"image":{},"text":{"format":1,"content":"<div class=\"aventyr\">\n<p class=\"s5\">Rybalkan Establishments</p>\n<h2>Rybalka City Hall</h2>\n<p>The governmental hub of the small village, this intimidating structure contains the guard barracks, mayor’s quarters, the council court, among others important facilities.</p>\n<img style=\"display:block;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto\" src=\"modules/aaw-games-aventyr/Setting-images/Rybalka-City-Hall-1-of-2.webp\" width=\"486\" height=\"800\" />\n<p>The governmental hub of the small village, this intimidating structure contains the guard barracks, records/licensing, village jail, mayor’s office, council court, and @UUID[.AMC4KKCcHuBgS853#mayor-igor-leonid]{the mayor’s} personal living quarters.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<section id=\"secret-J2CFEg1Z3ESt8owz\" class=\"secret\">\n<p>Two secret rooms are hidden within the onion domes.

Sulwotik Spirits serves up heavily intoxicating spirits made from local berries which while tasting quite sour quickly warm up a chilled weary traveler. Traditional Vikmordere foods are served here which are a mix of the Vikmordere tribal nomad diet and the Vikmordere settler staples.

A meeting place for visitors and dignitaries and place where one could always find a warm meal and a clean bed. That all ended around a year ago when the lodge mysteriously caught fire and burnt to the ground. After the suspected arson of the original lodge, one of the lodge’s former patrons- Albreck Samson decided to rebuild. Albreck, spent his life savings on the reconstruction of the old building. He wanted every detail of the new lodge to match the former establishment.</p>\n<p>The construction process was plagued by strange occurrences which always seemed to happen at night. The carpenters would return each morning to find tools missing and ladders knocked over. Although these incidents happened quite frequently the pranksters never caused any harm to the workers.

Several of the younger members of the family travel far and wide promoting their product, but most of the family is employed in and around the yard, tending the copper vats and stores of maturing alcohol in cask.</p>\n<p>The secret, as Markus Balcan just might tell you, is the spring rising in back of the yard. Its fresh, clear water imparts a distinctive pure taste to the grain alcohol the family is rightly renowned for producing.

From a distance it looks like a drop of blood on snow, hence its name. The petals of the Bloodflower can be crushed and are able to lessen the effects of intoxination with the single side effect of causing a bad breath. Winning a drinking contest versus an opponent who uses Bloodflowers in his drink is barely possible, for he won’t feel much of the effects and after a few mugs he just has to exhale in his opponent’s general direction. It not only stinks to turn all but a half-orc’s stomach, it also carries the alcoholic amounts it bound in the opponents direction.</p><p>Bloodflowers grow nearly everywhere, and certain people in Rybalka grow them in their gardens to give newcomers a special welcome in a friendly drinking contest.</p><h2>Coldflower</h2><p>The coldflower grows near the timberline. Its iceblue petals are cold to the touch. Coldflowers are liked by the remorhaz of the North, who eat them whenever possible. Even in a fight there’s a 1 in 4 chance that they eat instead of attacking. Additionally, when the remorhaz has eaten a coldflower the dreaded heat ability of the polar worms is dulled by the effect and only half as potent for an hour. Plucking a flower keeps that ability for but a day, and alchemists of the North have tried in vain to emulate the ability of the coldflower or at least keep it fresh for an extended time.</p><h2>Liverleaf</h2><p>This flower is all green, petals, leaves and stem. It blooms only a few days each year, when the sun doesn’t set. The long leaves, which are curled when the eight orange petals are open, is highly prized in @UUID[JournalEntry.QlctNkzE9injOde9.JournalEntryPage.DXD1ygEckY0JIUFB]{Klavekian} noble restaurants, for it tastes like the very expensive fresh liver of a remorhaz. Obviously it’s much less dangerous plucking that taste then getting it fresh from a most likely enraged polar worm. The leaves have to be dusted as long as they are curled, then applied to meat like a spice. A single leave can turn the taste of a chicken into the taste of liver.</p><h2>Oreadian Flower</h2><p>This plant is named after the notoriously closemouthed oreadians, for its petals are almost always closed, too. Only when its freezing cold the blue petals open and their nectar can be harvested. The oreadian flower is warm, almost hot, and attracts creatures by the warmth in order to procreate.</p><p>The nectar of one oreadian flower is enough to heal small wounds for 2-5 points of damage, but it heals the double amount of wounds from cold and, maybe due to its warmth, cures exhaustion from cold sources. Northerners are known for using magical cold to get the petals to open and to harvest them.</p><h2>Singing tree</h2><p>This tree grow sparsely on the northern edge of the @UUID[.zUmf61j380tilNZt]{Dark Wood}. Its wood is very hard, able to dull a logger’s ax, but it’s easily affected by magic like Warp Wood, which has a stronger effect on the material and can easily transfer two times the normal amount. The oddest thing about the trees are its fruits, though. They ripe in the short summer of the North, then the nutlike shells open, releasing the seed. The shells keep hanging on the tree and freeze over as early as autumn. In the winter the winds let the shells chime and sometimes even sing. Certain feys collect the shells right before they thaw in spring, before they fall down and shatter, and use them to built musical instruments.</p><h2>Winterflower</h2><p>The Winterflower is the rarest flower in the world and even a festival is named after it. It thrives in cold mountainous regions and has a reputation for growing on difficult-to-access mountain peaks and cliffs. It is the only known flower to grow through layers of snow to reach the sunlight. The one to retrieve a Winterflower and transplant it near Rybalka receives great praise from the entire village. The Wildflower is considered a blessing which protects the village from harm. Only once in the past eight years has this feat been accomplished.</p><p></p></div>","markdown":""},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"sort":0,"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}},{"name":"Fauna of the North","type":"text","_id":"BSbDtCDmgwQBw1co","title":{"show":false,"level":1},"image":{},"text":{"format":1,"content":"<div class=\"aventyr\"><p class=\"s5\">Fauna of the North</p><p>The animal life of the northern lands includes common animals big and small like yaks, vultures, rats or cave bears, but also a few less well known like those described below.</p><h2>Coppercat</h2><p>Coppercats live near the mines or with settlers who have adopted them but are rarely seen in other parts of the Rybalkan peninsula.

In settlements coppercats like iron ovens, but that may be connected to the warmth those oven produce more than to the metal.

Though it looks like a sheep from afar, the name is misleading, for the daggersheep is biologically related to the goat, not the sheep. The daggerlike horns for which it is named and its aggressiveness when cornered makes it difficult to tame, so it usually is but hunted. It has a soft wool which is easy to weave and fat flesh to offer, but tends to flee into the mountain ranges like the goat it really is. The white wool it grows when the temperatures start to fall makes it difficult to spot in the snow. Winter clothes made out of daggersheep wool are warm, but stink heavily and tend to curl when wet, which hasn’t made it very popular in the @UUID[JournalEntry.QVrlu0lTv2vFtT5P]{Klavek Kingdom}.

The valley and the lakes were carved out over two thousand years ago when a massive glacier passed through the area. In the great Serpent Lake the preferred method of travel is by boat. One must be cautious and hire an expensive and well trained navigator to steer through the maze that is Serpent Lake lest they lose their way.</p>\n<img style=\"display:block;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto\" src=\"modules/aaw-games-aventyr/Setting-images/Serpent-Lake-Map-Todd-Gamble-750x497.webp\" width=\"750\" height=\"497\" />\n<p>The Lake is named after large slimy black predatory serpents which are spotted surfacing from time to time. Legends speak of a behemoth Serpent which dwells in the deepest darkest part of the lake. The Serpent is rumored to surface and feast upon entire ships which lose their way in the confusing corridor of linked lakes of the Vikmordere Valley.</p>\n<p>The Serpent Lake is largely navigable over the whole year in most parts, only the shores freeze in winter in its southern and middle parts. Further north the lake almost totally freezes, maybe due to a lack of depth. Sages speculate about the reason for the southern and middle parts being so free of ice, hot springs in the depth being the most common explanation, though the water does indeed feel very cold. The oreads do think that there is salt in the sea, even if it is defined as freshwater, but the salt was somehow changed by the Ancestors, who were experts at earth magic and known to work with subterranean salts, as the Wall of Salt that seals Aisnley’s Lake from the Serpent Sea confirms. Rumors speak of a whole palace made of salt with something sleeping in it, waiting with inhuman patience to be awakened once more.</p>\n<p>Although the Serpent Lake has its share of dangerous sea serpents, there are of course countless other harmless animals in it also. The most common are listed in the following section.</p>\n<h2>Snowsquid</h2>\n<p>The squids in the Serpent Lake are thick-skinned and even more rubbery then their more known cousins from the south. They are as white as snow, which let to their name. The meat of snowsquids takes about two hours to cook, but is very tasty. Its not storeable without magic, though, losing its consistency after a day and developing a stench that’s not only tough to bear – Fortitude DC 15 or nauseated as long as in 50 feet distance to the squid or 100 feet downwind from it – it also tends to attract remorhazes, who seems to think of it as a rare delicacy. After three days the stench (and remorhaz-attracting) stops and the meat is no longer eatable for creatures who are not carrion crawlers.</p>\n<p>On at least two occasions there have been round wounds on a washed on @UUID[.Erya8w29cRTTJELu#wintereel]{wintereel} , causing rumors of a giant squid living somewhere in the Lake with tentacles big and strong enough to crack a ship’s hull.</p>\n<h2>Snow Water Lily</h2>\n<p>In remote corners of the Serpent Lake the snow water lily grows. Although it looks a bit withered and brittle to most observants, the kitsune of the @UUID[.zUmf61j380tilNZt]{Dark Wood} trade a fortune in for each living exemplary. It’s unknown what they need them for, but it has raised the interest of other inhabitants in recent years.</p>\n<h2>Wintereel</h2>\n<p>Some say that the name of the Serpent Lake originated from a bad perception. There are some big eels in the lake easily mistaken for a sea serpent, which may give this story credit. Biggest among those harmless freshwater eels is the wintereel, which is 3 feet long and light blue in color. It can even go on land, and many an unsuspecting witness was shocked to see such a giant fish crawling through the mud. Wintereels are not tasty and generally harmless, they avoid fishing vessels and oretransports and are ignored by the twolegged landwalkers in turn.

The crab burrows into the sands when threatened, but if unearthed can provide a healthy meal for a grown human that lasts for a day. The burrowed crabs are almost perfectly hidden though, one needs a survival check DC 20 to spot a part of their fur or shell poking up. The shells are recently coming into favor in @UUID[JournalEntry.QVrlu0lTv2vFtT5P]{Klavek }as a new form to decorate noble estates, but it’s tough to say how long this particular fashion trend will stay.</p>\n</div>","markdown":""},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"sort":0,"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{"core":{"sheetClass":""}}},{"name":"Dark Wood","type":"text","_id":"zUmf61j380tilNZt","title":{"show":false,"level":1},"image":{},"text":{"format":1,"content":"<div class=\"aventyr\"><p class=\"s5\">Dark Wood</p><p>Feared and respected by even the most powerful Vikmordere warriors, the Dark Wood is a shadowy and foreboding place. Legend speaks of a horrible deed done by evil druidic sorcerers long ago which created a rift to another world through which devils spawned. @UUID[.gu6JRkzbpzHfoNf6#ruins/crypt-of-sun-lord-kateek]{The Sun Lord Ka’Teek} of the Ancestors along with his followers battled many of the beasts and were able to seal the rift. Unfortunately the damage was already done; The devils and maybe even demons had spread into the forest now known as Dark Wood. Over hundreds of years the devils from the rift bred with the creatures of the forest creating all manner of foul monsters.</p><p>Travel through Dark Wood is extremely dangerous during the day and considered suicide if undertaken at night. Regional hunters must learn the art of the warrior or die in this unforgiving land. The strong survive while the weak become fodder for the beasts of Dark Wood.</p><h2>The three parts</h2><p>In reality the feared Dark Wood consists of three separate woods with very specific features to each of them. One part of the forest is dominated and formed by the fey, the second by the devils that were let lose here, and the third is the contested area between those two, which is partly a battleground and partly ignored, which makes that tiny part a fairly normal wood.</p><h2>The forest of the fey</h2><p>This part of the wood has many great trees with leaves as thick as barrels, the canopy woven together like a roof. In most parts the sky can’t be seen from the grounds, which was a reason for the name of the Dark Wood. Oddly enough, and surely a sign of fey intervention, there is much undergrowth, narrow gullets and bramble-infested thickets. Strange berries grow in this land, but trespassers are advised to let them be, since the fey are known to hunt down all who pluck them. Thus very little is known about them and the other fruits of the faeries. There are rumors of healing berries, berries that cure sickness or even exhaustion, and berries that are like alcohol growing on bushes. A strange land it is, reigned by a mighty dryad if rumors are to be believed.</p><p></p><h2>The forest of the devils</h2><p>Where the fiends run rampart, the forest is bleeding. That’s not literary so, most of those rumors are regarded as at least inflated, but the devils have left their marks for sure. Since it’s almost impossible to reach the devil-part of the Dark Wood without crossing through the fey-part, which is dangerous enough, information about the home of the infernals are scarce. Sometimes a devil crosses the fey-part to reach human lands, though, and the resulting battles take a heavy toll each time. The current colonization reinforcement is partly caused due to such a transgression, and the @UUID[JournalEntry.QVrlu0lTv2vFtT5P]{Klavekian} government has reacted to the demand for a whole legion of soldiers by sending a few adventurer groups. The joy of the populace of @UUID[JournalEntry.ismpCNWpGHvB1iPw]{Rybalka} is a bit less then boundless about this Klavekian decision to save money.</p><h2>The contested forest</h2><p>There are known ways through parts of the forest where the chances to avoid devils and fey are better than elsewhere. Those paths are shifting, though, depending on the latest conflicts, and adventurers are still strongly urged to keep away from the Dark Woods. There are some tough souls who live in the friendlier parts, most notably there is the Hunter’s Cabin of Cual Beartooth, but rumors tell the man who lived there has long been abducted by one of the fighting parties.</p><p></p></div>","markdown":""},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"sort":0,"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}},{"name":"The Jagged Crags","type":"text","_id":"vLMBL7x85Ve3NC06","title":{"show":false,"level":1},"image":{},"text":{"format":1,"content":"<div class=\"aventyr\">\n<p class=\"s5\">The Jagged Crags</p>\n<img style=\"display:block;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto\" src=\"modules/aaw-games-aventyr/Setting-images/Jagged-Crags.webp\" width=\"707\" height=\"435\" />\n<p>The Jagged Crags are a low lying broken mountain range on the Rybalkan Peninsula. Most of the wilderness located within the Jagged Crags has not been explored by the Rybalkans.</p>\n<p>The entrance to the Dwarf Realm, Icecrag Monastery, and the location of the rare @UUID[.w79VOo3UeUGraouv#winterflower]{Winterflower} are all rumored to be hidden in these frigid mountain peaks. The crags get their name from the jagged points that jut hundreds of feet into the air throughout the region. Climbing these small mountains is utterly suicidal and unnecessary. There is a reason why this particular region has not been explored.</p>\n<p>The Jagged Crags are dangerous enough for their terrain, but a strange weather phenomenon makes them even more hazardous. During autumn and spring the winds are gusting, which means that periods of calm breezes, lasting for 3d10 minutes, are followed by short busts of strong wind, lasting for 1d10 minutes and reaching up to 50 mph. During the onset of later phases those with strength 13 or less must make successful Strength checks DC 7 to not fall prone, and movement during strong winds is halved. The animal life of the Jagged Crags has adapted to these weather conditions and is thus not affected. Skilled mountaineers do get signs from this though. With a successful Survival check DC 12 they notice seemingly odd animal behavior like birds landing or soaring high, animals burrowing into the earth or snow and even @UUID[.w79VOo3UeUGraouv#oreadian-flower]{oreadean flowers} flattening themselves. Many a would-be-mountaineer was blown from a ledge by a gusting wind, never to be seen again.</p>\n<p>In winter the Jagged Crags are stormy, with blizzards raging for 2d6 hours before a calm but still frosty breeze replaces them. Those calm phases are also longer and can last from a few hours to whole days. With a storm comes a great amount of snow, restricting vision to 10 feet, be it normal, lowlight- or darkvision. The @UUID[.BSbDtCDmgwQBw1co#daggersheep]{daggersheep} still have good movement rates under those condition, letting sages speculate that they have a strange additional sense of orientation.</p>\n<p>In summer the Jagged Crags do explode with life. The snow never leaves the mountain tops entirely, but whole summits are red as blood with blooming @UUID[.w79VOo3UeUGraouv#bloodflower]{bloodflowers}. In lower regions the snow does melt, creating the summer flows through ragged ravines. Oreads are sometimes seen to travel far and wide, collecting the water for the spirits they are supposed to carry. @UUID[JournalEntry.QlctNkzE9injOde9.JournalEntryPage.t4LZuyNruvzneOHD]{Dwarves} also prefer to collect the cold waters, but they do it for their distillery operations. Since those summerflows that flow through the @UUID[.zUmf61j380tilNZt]{Dark Wood} are a preferred home for water nymphs and other feys, sages do agree that there is something special about the flows of summer, but as of now no one seems to have a clue about the details.</p>\n<p>While mountaineering in the Jagged Crags is best done in summer, many agree that it is best not done at all. Even in summer the mornings can be below freezing, but temperatures can rise to almost hot conditions within hours. Wind is between calm and light, but can reach 40 mph occasionally and carry heavy rains, which lower perception to 10 feet except for the aforementioned daggersheeps. During a summer storm, which can last from 15 minutes to an hour (roll 1d4 for 15-minutes increments), there is a chance of 70% per increment that 1d4 lightning bolt strikes near an adventuring party. Determine the victims randomly, but double the chances for members in heavy iron armor or with a pole weapon. Each bolt deals 3d10 points of electricity damage, a reflex save halves that damage. Daggersheep are not immune against this, its not unusal to find a cooked daggersheep somewhere on the Crags in summer. If you saw off a daggerlike horn of such a sheep, you can use it three times as a dagger with the shock special ability (extra 1d6 points of electricity damage), but this also affects the wielder. The lightning is stored for up to three weeks or until spend, whichever comes faster. Harvesting a daggersheep horn deals 1d8 of electricity damage unless protected. This doesn’t count against the shock special ability. A daggersheep horndagger can be reloaded with lightning bolt as by the rules.</p>\n</div>","markdown":""},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"sort":0,"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{"core":{"sheetClass":""}}},{"name":"Rybalka-NPCs","type":"text","_id":"AMC4KKCcHuBgS853","title":{"show":false,"level":1},"image":{},"text":{"format":1,"content":"<div class=\"aventyr\">\n<p class=\"s5\">Rybalka-NPCs</p>\n<h2>Government</h2>\n<p><strong>@UUID[.AMC4KKCcHuBgS853#mayor-igor-leonid]{Mayor Igor Leonid}</strong> – Igor Leonid is the Mayor of @UUID[JournalEntry.ismpCNWpGHvB1iPw]{Rybalka} and originally hails from @UUID[JournalEntry.QVrlu0lTv2vFtT5P.JournalEntryPage.dwAJ5Jtc6ii8zQoh]{Mohkba}, capital city of the @UUID[JournalEntry.QVrlu0lTv2vFtT5P]{Klavek Kingdom}.</p>\n<p><strong>@UUID[.AMC4KKCcHuBgS853#village-guard]{Village Guard}</strong> – The 10 guards who protect the fishing village of Rybalka from the dangers of the wilderness.</p>\n<p><strong>@UUID[.AMC4KKCcHuBgS853#wvolf]{Wvolf of the Village Guard}</strong> – Rybalkan resident long before the Klavek Kingdom ousted the @UUID[JournalEntry.QlctNkzE9injOde9.JournalEntryPage.I4CpK8rTs0HgD7hW]{Vikmordere}.

In his free time, Igor frequents the @UUID[.zpUSPaV4mxOVvVDx#thirsty-serpent-tavern]{Thirsty Serpent Tavern} where the patrons revel in his boisterous, booming singing voice as he leads them in traditional Klavekian songs. He has been known to raise the morale to such great heights that patrons of the tavern often volunteer for guard duty. Rumors persist of a song which the mayor sang upon coming to Rybalka which convinced twenty young men to sign up and serve in the Klavekian military.</p>\n<p>Despite his rough and tumble nature, Igor Leonid upholds the strict laws of the Klavek Kingdom in this cold and forsaken outpost on the edge of Vikmordere territory.</p>\n<p>After defeating the Vikmordere in a bloody war, the village of Rybalka was established and Igor was sent to hold the peace. Igor has a fine record of making peace out of hostility in the Klavek Kingdom and will perform the same way here. He has no fear of battle but prefers negotiation if at all possible. When it comes to negotiation, Igor’s soft-spot is homemade bread pudding, those in the know can exploit this and win his heart by tempting his gluttonous belly.</p>\n<p>The Klavekian Monarchy has assigned Mayor Igor Leonid thirty Klavekian Soldiers which patrol a 15-mile radius around Rybalka.</p>\n<p>Ten Rybalkan soldiers (dubbed the @UUID[.AMC4KKCcHuBgS853#village-guard]{Village Guard} by the locals) have also been appointed to Rybalka under the direct leadership of Mayor Igor Leonid.

He keeps his past life a secret and speaks only when spoken to.</p>\n<h3>Barrett Colvek</h3>\n<p>Barrett is a foolhardy adventurer type who drinks too much and is always late for his shifts. He loves his job, but is quite distracted.</p>\n<h3>Derann the Orphan</h3>\n<p>Derann is someone who you would want at your back. He is the first to warn others of danger and is always looking out for the best interests of the Klavek Kingdom.</p>\n<h3>Jells</h3>\n<p>Jells is a roguish type who was once a pickpocket but decided to change his ways and become a Klavekian Guard. The catalyst for this change was his brother’s death at the hands of the Vikmordere during one of their many raids on the Klavek Kingdom.</p>\n<h3>Lexandor Hyrule III</h3>\n<p>Following in his father’s footsteps, Lexandor is noble, arrogant, and rude. Lexandor spends much of his time studying, flaunting his family’s wealth and notoriety, and flirting with women at the local tavern.</p>\n<h3>Nolan Brenweld</h3>\n<p>Nolan comes from a noble family, but unlike Lexandor does not flaunt it. Nolan prefers to keep to himself and works on improving his skills as a warrior. @UUID[.AMC4KKCcHuBgS853#mayor-igor-leonid]{The mayor} has trusted both Nolan and @UUID[.AMC4KKCcHuBgS853#wvolf]{Wolf} with secret missions from time to time and both men are in line for a promotion.</p>\n<h3>Olav Gyutok</h3>\n<p>Olav is a huge man who wades into battle with joy. He loves to crush skulls and make mince-meat of his enemies. Olav has been a guard for over 10 years and plans on defending the Klavek Kingdom until he can no longer heft a sword.</p>\n<h3>Perry Yefim</h3>\n<p>A naturally curious young lad, Perry prefers to stay indoors where it is warm. Perry most times chooses to perform clerical duties while working on his own novel about life on the edge of the untamed wilderness. He performs his rounds quickly and then returns to his writings, hoping to publish a book in the next few years.</p>\n<h3>Valerius Untoo</h3>\n<p>Valerius comes from a family of mages, thus he is the black sheep but does not mind. He has a bit of an inferiority complex, but does a satisfactory job of defending the village. Valerius is having an affair with a local young woman. If the woman’s husband was to find out he would most likely attempt to kill Valerius. Thus, Valerius keeps his “nightly appointments” to himself.</p>\n<h3>Wvolf</h3>\n<p> </p>\n<img style=\"float:right;margin:0px 15px 15px 0px;border:0px\" title src=\"modules/aaw-games-aventyr/Setting-images/Wvolf.webp\" width=\"250\" height=\"323\" />\n<p>Wvolf lived in this region long before the Klavek Kingdom ousted the Vikmordere from Rybalka.

The location and importance of these areas have not been disclosed to the general public. Official legal documents have been signed and the Klavek Kingdom must uphold this agreement as long as the Klavekian Monarchy holds power in the Vikmordere Valley.</p>\n<p>The mayor has trusted both @UUID[.AMC4KKCcHuBgS853#nolan-brenweld]{Nolan} and Wvolf of the Village Guard with secret missions from time to time. Both men are in line for a promotion.</p>\n<p>It seems that no matter how many years pass Wvolf does not seem to age. This causes many of the villagers to question Wvolf’s lineage. He ignores such gossip, preferring to focus instead on his role in this village. Wvolf keeps to himself and is rarely caught off guard, especially in the wilderness. When he must fight he does so from a distance using his longbow. In close quarters he dual wields two magical shortswords with maniacal fury. Wvolf is a formidable opponent and is rarely bested.</p>\n<h2>The Black Bears</h2>\n<p>The Black Bears are comprised of young yet seasoned veterans of the Klavekian Military who assisted in taking Rybalka from the hands of the Vikmordere. They are foul-mouthed, fearless brutes who until recently were the only force available for hire on the Rybalkan Peninsula.

Uncle Siescor saw a strength and wisdom in the young Juriendor that his father had not. He urged him to take the oath to the God of War and become a member of the church.</p>\n<p>Juriendor swore to make a difference in the world and fight for truth and justice wherever the winds of change blew strongest. Juriendor made a difference wherever he went, solving problems using wise and insightful diplomacy. When diplomacy failed, the God of War summoned courage and strength within Juriendor’s very being which he in turn bestowed upon the other priests. Juriendor proved himself in the church, at the negotiation table, and on the field of battle. After many grueling combats and tactical victories, Juriendor was promoted to High Priest of the God of War.</p>\n<p>A progressive force in a cold and dangerous world, Juriendor has been placed on the frontier of civilization in his first position as High Priest of the God of War at the Rybalka Temple.</p>\n<p>High Priest Juriendor preaches a daily sermon at the Rybalka Temple each morning immediately after sunrise. His six acolytes and two priests assist townsfolk with minor matters, while High Priest Juriendor handles larger religious and moral matters.

Even the sage’s closest associates do not know his true name.</p>\n<p><strong>History:</strong> Yuri Statel began his career at a young age as a Cavalier serving the Lion Brigade of King Tokolvor XII. While serving his country in the Great War Yuri was captured by the enemy. They tortured him for over a year before he was rescued by his countrymen. No one knows exactly what happened in that enemy dungeon, but Yuri was changed forever.</p>\n<p>After this event, he returned to the Klavek Capitol of Mohkba. Seeking an audience with King Tokolvor Klavek XII’s son the Prince, he petitioned to become a personal historian of the Klavek Kingdom. During his time serving Prince Klavek, his father King Klavek was mysteriously poisoned. The murderer was never found and Prince Tokolvor Klavek became the current king, King Tokolvor Klavek XIII. (This knowledge is known only to historians serving the monarchy or those Klavekian soldiers old enough to remember such events.

Secondly, Quorron is an outcast and was banished from his homeland after killing his uncle in a dispute over rights to the family forge.</p>\n</section>\n<p>Quorron has never cared for politics or gossip and believes that “might makes right.” This is why he holds no qualms over the new claim-holders on Rybalka. The Klavekians defeated the Vikmordere (Quorron’s former employers) with brute force. Therefore, with Quorron’s “might makes right” philosophy, the Klavekians have every right to own this land.</p>\n<p>When dealing with customers Quorron is short and to the point, ignoring small talk entirely and working tirelessly to appease his clients.</p>\n<h3>Quorron’s Quests</h3>\n<p>Quorron sometimes hires trustworthy adventurers and mercenaries to perform various quests which typically have something to do with ore, metal, crafting techniques, or his customers’ orders. He is short and to the point when offering up a quest and doesn’t like a lot of questions.</p>\n<h2>Fin Starling</h2>\n<p> </p>\n<img style=\"float:right;margin:0px 15px 15px 0px;border:0px\" title src=\"modules/aaw-games-aventyr/Setting-images/Fin-Starling.webp\" width=\"256\" height=\"423\" />\n<p>Fin Starling owns the @UUID[.zpUSPaV4mxOVvVDx#thirsty-serpent-tavern]{Thirsty Serpent Tavern} and has done so ever since his father passed away last winter.</p>\n<p>A semi-retired adventurer in his late twenties, Fin spent much of his youth traveling the world and getting in (and out of) tight spots. A swashbuckler and “Jack of all trades, master of none”, Fin sometimes made his living in illegitimate ways. He has visited almost every single city, town, and village along the coast of the Klavek Homeland and has even traveled to a few remote islands. He loves to tell tales of his journeys but never speaks of his travels outside the Klavek Kingdom; Fin fears reprisal from the monarchy for “unauthorized &amp; undocumented entry into enemy territory” as well as the crime of “fraternizing with the enemy” as a possible alternative charge.</p>\n<p>Fin is a real ladies man and enjoys flirting and teasing women all the way to the bedroom. Despite this fact, he prefers to stay single. In the past when a woman would get too close, he would pick up and leave town in the blink of an eye. Only time will tell how Fin will handle such an affair when his commitment to the family tavern keeps him grounded in Rybalka.</p>\n<p>Thus far Fin has turned down all advances by @UUID[.AMC4KKCcHuBgS853#claudette-vanderbilt]{Claudette Vanderbilt}. This thoroughly confuses her given her special nature for attracting men. Luckily for Fin he wears a magical ring which protects him from Claudette’s powers. He found the ring in a treasure horde a few years ago but is oblivious to both the nature of the ring and Claudette’s evil powers.</p>\n<p>Since taking over the Thirsty Serpent Tavern from his deceased father, Fin has grown bored and does his best to please patrons while putting on a show to keep himself entertained. He longs to go adventuring again and has thought about selling the tavern; he is prevented from doing so by a promise made to his dying father. Before his father passed away, Fin pledged that he would keep the family business alive. Fin craves his freedom more than anything else and meanwhile gathers any tales of treasure or adventure he can get his hands on.</p>\n<h2>Landore Bugg</h2>\n<p>Landore Bugg is a strange fellow who bundles up in tattered and stained clothing. He meanders around town performing menial maintenance work on the village. Landore is paid by Klavek Kingdom.</p>\n<p>Landore owns a small home in Rybalka which he calls “@UUID[.zpUSPaV4mxOVvVDx#bugg-inn]{Bugg Inn}“. This so-called-inn is packed full of random useless junk that Landore picks up around town while performing work. There are two rooms at the inn which have been cleared out for visitors to rent which helps Landore pay to acquire more junk. Sometimes he makes his way out to Klavekian work sites to collect scrap metal and haul it back to his place to dump in the front yard.</p>\n<p>Landore is constantly chewing and spitting tobacco and stinks horribly of foul body odor.</p>\n<p>Most of the townsfolk steer clear of Landore not wishing to find themselves in a never-ending, one-sided conversation about Landore’s latest acquisition.</p>\n<h2>Sulwotik</h2>\n<p> </p>\n<img style=\"float:right;margin:0px 15px 15px 0px;border:0px\" title src=\"modules/aaw-games-aventyr/Setting-images/Sulwotik.webp\" width=\"201\" height=\"391\" />\n<p>Sulwotik owns the makeshift bar dubbed @UUID[.zpUSPaV4mxOVvVDx#sulwotiks-spirits]{Sulwotik’s Spirits} by the locals.</p>\n<p>Sulwotik was originally a tribal shaman of a large Vikmordere tribe but was told by the @UUID[JournalEntry.dOJJ8mRNTPtoihmF.JournalEntryPage.l22xqVPei8b2u04P]{Ancestor Spirit} to settle here at the lakeside village. When Sulwotik first came to the village it was full of lake craftsmen, tribal fishermen, and woodworkers all of the Ancestor People lineage. Sulwotik was quickly welcomed into their society and given the home of a man who had recently perished due to a serpent attack while fishing the Serpent Lake.</p>\n<p>Keeping his shamanistic rituals paramount, Sulwotik needed to find a way to make a living so that he could purchase food and wood in this new strange life. Thus, he learned the art of distillation and shared his intoxicating beverages with the locals who came to visit his home often. Eventually, his home began to change into a gathering place for the locals to drink and talk. It has existed this way ever since.</p>\n<p>The appeal of a down to earth home style atmosphere with fine stiff drinks greatly appeals to the Rybalkan soldiers. Sulwotik uses the opportunity to slowly introduce them to the culture of the Vikmordere and show them that his people are not the evil demons the Klavekian Monarchy makes them out to be. He does this very cautiously over dozens of visits and tests the waters with each Rybalkan soldier. Sulwotik is a wise man and knows that if his true nature is ever discovered he will most likely be tortured, interrogated, and possibly killed.</p>\n<p>Sulwotik sees the invasion of the Klavek Kingdom as a sign of change which the Ancestor Spirit told him could not be avoided. Now that the Klavekians have arrived it is up to Sulwotik to show them the ways of the forest, the mountain, the lake and the eagle, the beaver, and the bear. Nature is one with life and the Ancestor Spirit drives Sulwotik in all that he does. Sulwotik has erected all of the totem poles throughout Rybalka to fend off evil and give thanks to the Ancestor Spirit and Mother Nature. Many Klaveks have chopped them down and burned them for firewood just to spite Sulwotik.</p>\n<p>For every totem pole burnt, Sulwotik begins carving two more to replace it.</p>\n<section id=\"secret-E9cbnfdL0yaQ2fSF\" class=\"secret\">\n<p>Should the village ever come under attack Sulwotik may summon the Ancestor Spirit to imbue one of his totem poles with spiritual energy transforming it into a Totem Golem to protect the villagers.</p>\n</section>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>Claudette Vanderbilt</h2>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Claudette Vanderbilt is a widow in her mid 40’s with a dark secret.</p>\n<p>Claudette drapes her shapely body in fine black evening gowns, wearing enough jewelry to enhance her aesthetic appearance, but not so much as to appear gaudy. She can usually be found at the @UUID[.zpUSPaV4mxOVvVDx#thirsty-serpent-tavern]{Thirsty Serpent Tavern}, flirting with men half her age. She is quite confident and very charismatic which sometimes scores her a handsome man for the evening. She will only take home visitors to the village and never a resident. The townsfolk often jest about how scary she must look naked since none of her male suitors ever return to town again. Fact is, her suitors are never seen or heard from by anyone, ever.</p>\n<p>Claudette is a widow who has continued along in life just fine without her husband whom she found quite irritating. He was always barking orders at her and putting her down. Eventually Claudette grew tired of the orders and dropped some Laungoroot poison in his favorite rabbit stew. The meal was his last and she has lived happily in solitude ever since.</p>\n<section id=\"secret-Y2yroTkaz4ydE2ht\" class=\"secret\">\n<p>Although quite deranged, Claudette is not insane. She has found great pleasure in forging her own path in the world.</p>\n<p>Many years ago while cleaning the cellar, Claudette found a hidden compartment in the wall. Within the compartment rested the mysterious Tome of Nabid (cursed) and an ancient dagger with runes upon the blade known as the Dagger of Nabid (cursed). The large tome appeared quite ancient with a strange symbol burned into the stitched leather cover. Claudette kept the book hidden from her husband and studied the writings while he was out fishing each day. The tome taught her how to make the poison which she later used to kill him and regain the control he had taken from her the day they were wed. Little does Claudette know, but the tome and dagger are cursed and over time are slowly changing her into a Sea Hag. The change has occurred so gradually that Claudette has no recollection of how or why this happened. By drinking fresh blood drawn by the cursed dagger Claudette is able to keep her attractive appearance and alluring charisma.</p>\n<p>When Claudette brings male suitors to her home, she first tricks them by stripping them naked and tying them to her bed posts. She then proceeds to torture them whilst drinking their blood. If they yield and completely give up hope, she is able to transform them into rats using a witchcraft spell and a very sinister potion, both of which were learned from the evil cursed tome. In this state the creatures cannot remember their former life and must obey Claudette’s orders, understanding but unable to communicate or resist in any way. If one of her suitors fails to yield to her evil ways, she drinks their blood until they pass out and die, then carves up their corpse with the cursed dagger, feeding it to the other rats who take refuge in the cellar and tunnels below.</p>\n<p>Claudette’s ultimate goal is unknown even to her, but if she continues to grow in power and people keep disappearing, she will eventually be found out and will have to retreat to the depths of the Serpent Lake or face a traditional village mob lynching.</p>\n</section>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>Beatrice Sweet</h2>\n<p>Beatrice Sweet is @UUID[.AMC4KKCcHuBgS853#terrance-sweet]{Terrance Sweet’s} wife.

Every once in a while she gently sets down her needles and yarn and gazes out at the moon as if she were homesick and dreaming of another place she would rather be. She never speaks anymore and has fallen into a deep depression. Her husband Terrance has grown weary of spending time around her. He leaves her to her work and the trail of yarn turns into a long blanket which wanders over her lap, her legs, onto the floor and out into the living room, filling the entire room. When she runs out of one color she picks up another off the mantle and continues to add to the blanket. The blanket is a rainbow of dark and dreary colors which is drowning the living room and the life Terrance and Beatrice once had.</p>\n<h2>Terrance Sweet</h2>\n<p>Terrance is a gruff old man in his 60’s who hails from the old school. He is a fisherman and once slung nets and line for a living to raise his four children.</p>\n<p>The children have all since grown up and moved away, leaving Terrance alone with his wife @UUID[.AMC4KKCcHuBgS853#beatrice-sweet]{Beatrice} who has lost her mind in her old age. She sits quietly knitting and rocking back in forth in her chair all day long by the fire, staring out at the cold lake water lapping at the shore. She never speaks and Terrance has grown weary of spending time with her.</p>\n<p>Terrance spends most of his time outside in his cold shop at his workbench carving wood and repairing old fishing poles and nets. He smokes a pipe he carved himself, and wears an old flat cap to cover his bald spot. The wisps of wavy hair that remain cascade down grasping out at his shoulders. When it grows too long he pulls out a mirror and gives himself a trim. Terrance hums old fishing tunes as he works carving wood and once per evening, goes out on the lake in his old skiff to toss in a line and catch dinner.</p>\n<h2>Cual Beartooth</h2>\n<p> </p>\n<img style=\"float:right;margin:0px 15px 15px 0px;border:0px\" title src=\"modules/aaw-games-aventyr/Setting-images/Cual-Beartooth.webp\" width=\"232\" height=\"350\" />\n<p>Cual Beartooth is the only living man to have taken up residence in the horrific @UUID[.gu6JRkzbpzHfoNf6#dark-wood]{Dark Wood} and survived. His path was not an easy one, and Cual has the physical, mental, and emotional scars to prove it.</p>\n<p>Although he rarely speaks of it, Cual originally hails from the Klavek Homeland. Rybalkans know very little about Cual’s past and he prefers it that way. He migrated to this area long before the Klavekians ousted Rybalka from the Vikmordere, and is an old timer to the Vikmordere Valley. The Vikmordere granted him passage after he bested their strongest warriors in challenges of strength and courage and outsmarted the wisest and most knowledgeable of their shamans.</p>\n<p>After just one week upon arriving in the region, Cual gathered supplies and set up camp in the Dark Wood. On the first night, he was attacked by a horde of vicious monsters and was nearly slain. He would have died were it not for an onslaught of undead headless druidic sorcerers that arrived in order to battle the monsters and subsequently give chase.</p>\n<p>After the monsters and their undead pursuers fled his camp, he heard more creatures closing in on his location. As he began to bleed to death, Cual crawled across the forest floor looking for shelter.</p>\n<p>He finally found a small cave which turned out to be the den of a great bear. The massive bear awoke and grabbed Cual’s body in its great maw. Cual beat at the bear’s mouth and struggled to break free. After an intense struggle, Cual loosened a tooth of the bear and ripped it clean from the jaw of the great beast. Using the tooth as a dagger Cual stabbed again and again at the bear’s face, doing anything he could to stop the maw from crushing his already mangled body. After a horrific struggle, Cual was finally able to plunge the dagger deep enough into an eye socket and wedge it into the beast’s brain. The great bear dropped his limp body and they collapsed together in death, but Cual would not die.</p>\n<p>He awoke the next morning, miraculously still alive and barely clinging to his mortal life. Cual used every ounce of strength within his being and body to lift his head and crawl out of the cave. He managed to find a small stream where he drank but feared the water would leak through the dozens of puncture holes covering his body.</p>\n<p>Amazingly, the water was enough for Cual to gather his strength and return to camp. It was there that he found the body of a slain devil. The devil wore magical gear and armor which Cual plundered. Cual found a small vial containing a sweet smelling water. Since he wouldn’t live long in his current state Cual took a chance and downed content of the vial. Miraculously the magical water closed most of his wounds and brought strength and vigor back to his limbs. He quickly grabbed the rest of the devil’s gear including a huge double-bladed axe which felt as light as a feather.</p>\n<p>There were many other restless nights but with the help of the devil’s magical gear and Featheraxe (as Cual named his double-bladed beauty), he survived and in a way prospered in a forbidden land where no other man dared tread.</p>\n<p>@UUID[.gu6JRkzbpzHfoNf6#hunters-cabin]{Cual’s cabin} is a refuge for Klavekian and Vikmordere alike and a place where both are welcome but neither enemies.

These remnants of civilizations add to the uniqueness of the wasteland, creating a rich and layered reminder of entropy on the face of Aventyr.</p>\n<h2>History</h2>\n<p>Ages ago the events that created the wasteland known as the Scorched Lands were set in motion by a group of powerful mages from @UUID[JournalEntry.oVgfVPmxlNXfN3CW]{Timaeus}—the Obelisk Order. This penultimate group of spellcasters dared tempt the natural order of Aventyr and sought to control the power of the Sun, and the resulting catastrophe threatened to destroy the entire planet. The Obelisk mages had created a Shard of the Sun, infused with the essence of the great celestial body itself (a source of unimaginable and unlimited energy) but they were ill prepared to handle the power of a star and quickly realized their doom. The Shard that had been placed high above the planet began its plummet towards the surface and only by coming together was the Order able to avert disaster and repel the Shard of the Sun (but not before betrayal by one of their own). Unable to completely destroy their creation, they instead halted its decent and placed it in orbit around the planet. To this day the Obelisk Order performs a fell ritual each year to keep it at bay and soaring across the sky, though every rebuff costs each of them a piece of their humanity (and many question how long the mages will sacrifice themselves).</p>\n<p>@UUID[JournalEntry.oVgfVPmxlNXfN3CW.JournalEntryPage.EVR6caNc4jmcLjmb]{Mek’Madius}, the betrayer, attempted to assume the power of the Shard for himself. He turned on his brothers during their first critical ritual and almost succeeded in damning all of Aventyr, but the power of the sun proved too much for him to handle and his skin—some say his very soul—was burned off in the resulting backlash. The last sight the Obelisk Order had of him, Mek’Madius was a scorched husk fleeing into the desolation, thought to be a broken thing and a shadow of what he once was.</p>\n<p>In the centuries that followed what was left of the Obelisk Order built up a regimented, ordered society in Timaeus, far from the desolation they left behind in the Scorched Lands. Meanwhile, the Shard of the Sun decimated swaths of previously populated lands; hundreds of thousands perished across the region and entire civilizations fell. The mages had little choice in the location for the penultimate ritual to repel the Shard—the center of the continent was once a thriving land, rich in leyline power, people, and city states. As the great anomaly passes overhead daily, it enters the atmosphere above the Scorched Lands and releases its awesome power, burning and destroying the region, focused so strongly in this region that the Transgression incinerates nearly all it touches. As this is a daily occurrence, the power of the spell the Obelisk Order used to repel the Shard back into orbit wanes and each year it must be renewed immediately after @UUID[.P5eOWITiKf5XaG1a#the-shedding]{The Shedding}, when the mage-made artifact is at its weakest after releasing its full amount of energy in a burst many times more powerful than a normal Transgresion. Should they fail for any reason, the Shard of the Sun will plummet towards the surface and wreak untold havoc on Aventyr.</p>\n<p>Yet there was one who did not want the Order to succeed: Mek’Madius. By transferring his essence to the Shard of the Sun he became the Sun Lich, and for every soul the Shard burned into oblivion, his power grew. It was not long before he created hordes of undead from the corpses of the wastes, and in campaign after campaign, he exerted his wrath against the Timaens. While they have so far been able to suppress the undead armies, the Scorched Lands have remained quiet for nearly 500 years and many in the Obelisk Order fear that unstoppable incursion brews in the sands. The Sun Lich’s stronghold is located in the inhospitable @UUID[JournalEntry.oVgfVPmxlNXfN3CW.JournalEntryPage.OYj59KJky98HgcM7#the-deadlands]{The Deadlands} north of Timaeus, but rumors persist that Mek’Madius possesses a vast network of structures and strongholds throughout the Scorched Lands, their purpose a mystery to all.</p>\n<p>Modern history—where it can even be recorded—is dominated by feudal warlords that have eked out territory within the wastes, the @UUID[.xrdBOyM6RxMqDjyu#formian-queen]{Formian “Under Queen”} and her expansionist @UUID[.xrdBOyM6RxMqDjyu#council-of-the-hive]{Council of the Hive}, and the treasure-hungry @UUID[.xrdBOyM6RxMqDjyu#gnomish-kilknogger-compendium]{Gnomish Kilknogger Compendium} that aims to control the untapped riches of the wasteland (by any means available).</p>\n<h2>Naming</h2>\n<p>Naming conventions within the civilized settlements are as varied as the denizens of this land.

Most find it advantageous to come together and form groups of survivalists that can effectively control a small town, a small area, or even larger territories in the Scorched Lands.</p>\n<h2>The Warlords</h2>\n<p>Throughout the Scorched Lands people of all types have endured; these extremely hardy folk find many reasons to tough out life in such a hostile land, from treasure hunting, sun magic farming, or simply the freedom and liberties the land naturally offers. While every man and woman in the Scorched Lands is beholden only to themselves for survival, there are those that seek to subjugate their fellows for personal gains—it is not uncommon for free towns to sprout up near valuable resources, and just as likely for a local bandit to assume the title of warlord and feudalize such encampments.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<img style=\"float:left;margin:0px 15px 15px 0px;border:0px\" src=\"modules/aaw-games-aventyr/Setting-images/Gladiator-247x300.webp\" width=\"247\" height=\"300\" />\n<p> Regardless of their origin, warlords are often dangerous and respected for their martial or arcane prowess as one cannot assume the title without the support of a band of loyal followers (though if they are loyal through respect or fear is another matter entirely). Many times their methods are the same—they aim to collect taxes and tithes from the working populace in exchange for territorial protection. Unfortunately, most tax their populations into situations of extreme poverty on purpose as to deny them the ability to mount an insurrection. Upon entering an encampment one can immediately surmise the nature of the town; if eyes dart to the ground and people flutter into shelters and avoid contact, it is probable that you have entered a warlord’s territory. Many times a local band will run a settlement in the absence of their warlord, and these lieutenants and sergeants are usually cruel and despicable of creatures (human or otherwise).</p>\n<p>While warlords tend to be cruel and maniacal, they are not above barter and reason. Many parley to find out what can be offered (if not taken by force) though caution is recommended when dealing with any warlord, as even the most charming leaders would not hesitate to strike a deal followed by a wicked and sudden betrayal. It is of no surprise that the warlords of the sands are in constant conflict with each other over resources and territory; incursions and clan wars are commonplace, deadly to both feudalistic regimes and the local populace. All of them unite in one respect, however: despising the @UUID[.xrdBOyM6RxMqDjyu#gnomish-kilknogger-compendium]{Gnomish Kilknogger Compendium}, viewing them as foreign invaders. Mutants are a touchy subject between individual warlords and while some accept them with open arms, others kill survivors of the Shard on sight. All warlords, and for that matter everyone in the Scorched Lands, fears the @UUID[.xrdBOyM6RxMqDjyu#formian-queen]{formians} and their Underqueen.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>Formian Queen</h2>\n<p> </p>\n<img style=\"float:right;margin:0px 15px 15px 0px;border:0px\" src=\"modules/aaw-games-aventyr/Setting-images/AAW-Formian-color-01-267x300.webp\" width=\"267\" height=\"300\" />\n<p>The last remaining formian matriarch on Aventyr, the Underqueen assumed the title by subjugating all other royal peers on the planet (a meticulous process that took eons to accomplish). Having come to the Scorched Lands before the burning to dominate her kin in the area, she launched a long-running and massive campaign against them resulting in the Formic Wars—an epic struggle lost to the legends and lore of the present age. As the sole queen, she is responsible for all formian behavior. While typically content in her dominance of the formians of Aventyr, the Underqueen’s ambition and patience border on true evil and rival the cunning of a high demon lord; her current goals are numerous and vast in scope, and some of them involve the surface world.</p>\n<p>No one knows the true location of the main hive (which some say extends throughout Aventyr and even beyond) but nest exits can be spotted in the Scorched Lands by their tower like protrusions from the sands. These spires of mounded dirt and grit extend into the sky at least dozens of feet and sometimes scores (with certain structures said to soar over a hundred feet into the sky). From these spires formian workers and warriors often attack settlements in search of slaves, food, or silver. No one knows what the formians want with such vast quantities of argent metal, but it is often stated that even a few pieces of silver can save your life from one of the brutal insects.</p>\n<p>While formic invasions on a large scale are extremely rare, the people of the Scorched Lands always retain the primal fear of insect hordes marching across the badlands. The machinations of the Underqueen are not for mortals to question, however, and those that have are seldom seen from again.</p>\n<h2>Council of the Hive</h2>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The Council of the Hive is a collection of formian myrmarchs that act as the direct administrative force for the Underqueen; though she can command each of her subjects individually or all of them collectively, it is often more efficient to outsource her commands to loyal, direct subordinates to carry out the minutia of details and day to day tasks. These formians are the rarest of exceptions within the hive castes. They are individuals in every sense, with their own thoughts and ambitions, and though beholden to the Underqueen their loyalty to her is never entirely assured. While this may seem like an imbalance in an otherwise orderly system, the necessity to alleviate the psychic load from her highness supersedes their innate compulsion for conformity. Thus the myrmarchs make up an elite, noble caste of hive society and act as high ranking officials in domestic and military matters.</p>\n<h2>Cult of the Hive</h2>\n<p> </p>\n<img style=\"float:right;margin:0px 15px 15px 0px;border:0px\" src=\"modules/aaw-games-aventyr/Setting-images/cult-of-the-hive-symbol-293x300.png\" width=\"236\" height=\"242\" />\n<p> A group of humanoids that worship the @UUID[.xrdBOyM6RxMqDjyu#formian-queen]{Underqueen} as a living god. the Cult of the Hive (or Indoctrinated as they call themselves) are always accompanied by a dominated formian slave under the direct control of a formian taskmaster. While the taskmaster does not need to be present, this special connection is rumored to extend directly to the Underqueen’s will. Anyone can join the ranks by passing an indoctrination ritual—those who succeed in the taskmaster’s eyes are promoted to fully dominated slaves. The highest-ranking officials in the Cult of the Hive’s hierarchy are slaves passed directly to myrmarchs and given free will.</p>\n<p>The Cult of the Hive acts primarily as an infiltration and information gathering unit for the formians, but they are also tasked with carrying out more indiscreet actions for which the Underqueen does not wish her formians directly involved. The group uses a symbol to designate private areas, sometimes left as a calling card—a six-pointed radial inside a circle representing the legs of an ant surrounded by the all-encompassing, all-seeing queen.</p>\n<h2>Gnomish Kilknogger Compendium</h2>\n<p>The GKC is part trading-company, part mercenary-group, but wholly corrupt. Barter is the language of their trade with an emphasis on cold, hard, gold. Known everywhere as the Water Barons, the GKC was established centuries ago by Klaxon Kilknogger as an enterprising expedition into the Scorched Lands in order to harvest the powers of @UUID[.P5eOWITiKf5XaG1a#sun-magic]{Sun Magic} directly. In the early days of the Compendium research and development trumped all other concerns, and their discoveries led to a rise in survivability and quality of life in the Scorched Lands. The GKC was the first to develop sun oil (and subsequently, the cool suits), and they cultivated the waternut trees and firegrass into an agricultural boon. Well-respected pioneers in the region, the countless other inventions they’ve developed (both great and small) have been an undeniable boon to the peoples of the sands (despite whatever ill will may be harbored against them today).</p>\n<p>Whatever respite from the harshness of life in the wasteland the GKR initially offered, much of it faded away when Klaxon Kilknogger died in a terrible accident and the family-run business destroyed itself from the inside. Eventually, Nitpik Kilknogger assumed control through force and his great-grandson, Filk Nitpik Kilnogger III, runs the Compendium to this day—for all his shortcomings, Filk possesses a business mind unmatched in all of Aventyr.</p>\n<p>Their main source of income for the last two centuries has been the water refinery on the southern shore of the Grave Morass. The GKC has developed technology able to affordably transform the crude sludge of the Morass into clean, drinkable water using the power of Sun Magic, which they then sell to badland settlements. Anyone trying to farm waternuts is harassed, and entire orchards are cut down in retribution for even planting more than what a farmer has negotiated to sow. Towns are visited regularly by GKC tax sheriffs, usually escorted by chained and bound fire elementals—unsurprisingly, they always get paid and rarely hesitate to extort someone for more than their due. Until recently these tariffs have been manageable, but lately, the merchants have been taxing more and more while rationing less and less water.</p>\n<h2>Mutants</h2>\n<p>The western portion of the Scorched Lands consists of a massive series of canyons, mesas, and plateaus collectively called the Fissures. This confusing landscape is perfectly suited to the reclusive lifestyle led by the many mutant clans who inhabit this area.</p>\n<img style=\"float:left;margin:0px 15px 15px 0px;border:0px\" src=\"modules/aaw-games-aventyr/Setting-images/rick-hershey-resistance-leader-alchemist-214x300.png\" width=\"214\" height=\"300\" />\n<p>  Most mutants are (or at least were) humans at one point but it is not uncommon to see evidence of the other races—their mutations are often aesthetic only, with very few having any positive benefit from their transformation. Their changes are as varied and diverse as one can imagine, ranging from saggy skin to multiple eyes, and other physical deformities.</p>\n<p>The power of the Shard of the Sun can often mutate a normal individual instead of destroying them. Sometimes even a glancing bit of energy from its passing, over time, creates minor mutations (see the Table SL-2: @UUID[Compendium.world.aventyr-campaign.oTOEMdCaf6UgfKqV]{Transgression Mutations} for possible mutations). In @UUID[JournalEntry.oVgfVPmxlNXfN3CW]{Timaeus} magical experimentation has led to the creation of mutant slave trade; many of these individuals are more intelligent and escape to freedom in the Fissures to rally others behind their causes. Some escapees have set up an elaborate and complicated system of ferrying their brethren from bondage, a nuisance that many in @UUID[JournalEntry.oVgfVPmxlNXfN3CW.JournalEntryPage.iUOrRhLyDdg71ghA]{Nyamo} have complained of for decades (though when they might respond is anyone’s guess).</p>\n</div>","markdown":""},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{"core":{"sheetClass":""}}},{"sort":300000,"name":"Culture","type":"text","_id":"AI7YhJjs53JTENcc","title":{"show":false,"level":1},"image":{},"text":{"format":1,"content":"<div class=\"aventyr\"><p class=\"s5\">Culture</p><p>The collective peoples of the Scorched Lands call themselves Pilgrims, and it is customary to greet folk with this term as a sign of respect and kinship (though other groups identify with whatever term best describes them: wastewalkers, mutants, nomad, and the like.) It takes a hard soul to warrant a life in what many in Aventyr call the worst place in the world, and these rugged individuals pride themselves on it. Life here is governed by a strict sense of survival and mutual respect—most settlements have rudimentary laws that keep the peace amongst the collective people while letting personal and property disputes be handled amongst the parties invested.</p><p>Few people journey into the Scorched Lands let alone travel out and as a consequence, the Common tongue has become antiquated, formed into a mix of formality and turns of phrase unique to the area. This can be a complication of nuance in a land where a wrong look could turn deadly, making speaking a game of sizing up a potential friend or foe as well as a matter of wit. It is fully customary to refer to individuals with the appropriate prefix (such as Mister, Misses, or Miss) unless on a first name basis, though sometimes then as well.</p><h3>Gods</h3><p>There are no gods unique to the Scorched Lands; each culture developed an understanding of the world through survival and most know that it was magic that made the land this way, not deities. Peoples and settlements tend to retain some of their original cultural identity, and shrines exist to all manners of divine beings, be they human, elf, or mutant. Religious temples in the Scorched Lands are extremely rare sights, usually devoted and built to a passing deific fad or cult and with time or warfare, the originators die off or leave behind a shell of a building much like the land itself</p></div>","markdown":""},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}},{"sort":400000,"name":"Geography","type":"text","_id":"GDlRxCWyVIxqhfBR","title":{"show":false,"level":1},"image":{},"text":{"format":1,"content":"<div class=\"aventyr\">\n<p class=\"s5\">Geography</p>\n<p>The Scorched Lands cover a swath of territory in the center of Aventyr and although the Shard of the Sun orbits the entire planet, only here does its power interact physically with the world. The region’s outside borders are transition zones and assume many of the features from their parent climate, but as one moves into the interior the landscape quickly transforms into a desolate wasteland devoid of most life. During the daytime hours temperatures typically range from 90° to 120° Fahrenheit (32–48° C) as in a normal desert climate, whereas at night some places can fall to as low as 40° Fahrenheit (4° C); it is rare for temperatures to rise or fall beyond these norms (and when they do, it is often because of the Transgression).</p>\n<p>The Shard of the Sun passes overhead twice daily, once around midnight and again around noon, always 12 hours apart (on a semi sun-synchronous orbit). As the planet rotates below the Shard is always between it and the sun during noon (or midnight) local time. The Transgression, as it is formally called, takes approximately one hour from the time the Shard appears on the eastern horizon until it passes completely under the western sky. During the Transgression a bright “second sun” appears in the sky, emanating waves of heat and bright light; as the Shard reaches the apex of the noon sky temperatures rise drastically, reaching upwards of 240° Fahrenheit (115° C). Fortunately, these extreme temperatures last for only “the dead 6’s”, (66 seconds) as the Shard passes directly overhead and the surface experiences the full blast of its power. This burning heat can be endured as long as one takes shelter, or finds cover from the direct rays of the Shard; the nightly passing of the Shard has no adverse effects as it receives no power from the sun.</p>\n<p>The landscape of the Scorched Lands is mostly desert wasteland, as any viable topsoil burned off centuries ago—dust, sand, and ash cover everything. The vegetation and plant life common to other climates are practically nonexistent, and only stone structures remain unclaimed by the scorching sands, remnants of structures that eerily outline the shapes of houses, mills, and other buildings. These corpses of civilization act as a reminder that once people did thrive here, but any life that remains has adapted to survive in this harsh environment.</p>\n<p>Even in this desolate destruction, there is diversity, however, in variations of life that speaks to the tendency for Aventyr’s denizens to survive despite whatever assails them. The northern reaches of the Scorched Lands are dominated by the Sea of Shards, endlessly shifting sand dunes dotted with strange ashen stalagmites that rise from the dunes. The central region comprises the Grave Morass, a vast pit filled with congealed ash, sand, and oil (a geographical formation unlike anything on Aventyr). The western Scorched Lands comprise a series of giant canyons and badland formations named by locals as the Fissures; primarily inhabited by mutants, this region is virtually unexplored. To the east, bordering the sea, are the salt flats of Water’s End and it’s said that anything composed of water that enters the territory never leaves in the same form.</p>\n<h2>Cities &amp; Settlements</h2>\n<p> </p>\n<h3>Ravine</h3>\n<p>Built into the crust of Aventyr in the central portion of the Scorched Lands is the city of Ravine, the largest settlement of the region. Hovels and dwellings crowd the sides of the busy canyon walls, while the surface level is left almost completely barren save for the sheltered guard posts and canyon lifts.. At the lowest level a stream of fresh, cool water runs throughout the canyon floor, created from a natural aquifer deep underground that runs south and west into the fissures. Pilgrims of all sorts have lived and survived here for centuries, each generation building dwellings closer and closer to the surface as space becomes more limited. The most prized and ancient of dwellings near the canyon floor are sought after and conspired for, often in the nearby market level’s giant lifts (spaced sporadically throughout to ferry goods to and from the surface on giant rock-counterweight scales). Silver plated reflectors set up along the sides of some of the canyon walls reflect sunlight into special cutout terraces that, with irrigation from the stream, provide food for the citizens.</p>\n<p>Ravine is run by an elected mayor that serves a five-year term and all positions of power within the city are elected officials or appointed by the mayor.</p>\n<h2>Flora and Fauna</h2>\n<h3>Nightbloom Acacia</h3>\n<p>Named for its ability to bloom at night and absorb moisture from the air, this plant is dormant for most of the day, its small flat leaves sprouting near sunset and staying open until dawn to draw in moisture. The nightbloom acacia has a thick light brown bark that grows to a thickness of many inches to protect from the Shard’s rays and blooms once a month during the full moon, the resulting flowers prized for their use in fragrances and dyes. Because of the Shedding, most trees do not exceed 8 ft. in height.</p>\n<h3>Firebloom Cactus / Shader Tree</h3>\n<p> </p>\n<img style=\"float:right;margin:0px 15px 15px 0px;border:0px\" src=\"modules/aaw-games-aventyr/Setting-images/firebloom-cactus-reduced_-240x300.webp\" width=\"240\" height=\"300\" />\n<p>This brown-skinned cacti is covered in small hairs and smells reminiscent of honey. The medium-sized center trunk of a firebloom cactus blossoms out into a thick, bulbous overgrowth that extends up to 10 ft. high and with branches 5 ft. long that form an outgrowth that protects from the Shard’s rays, shading the relatively delicate trunk. Once a day during the Transgression flowers open atop the canopy and seemingly absorb the Shard’s rays before sulking back into the outgrowth. Shader trees are rare and valued for protection they obviously offer, and are often confused with the deadly corpse cactus.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<h3>Corpse Cactus / Dead Man’s Rest</h3>\n<p> </p>\n<img style=\"float:left;margin:0px 15px 15px 0px;border:0px\" src=\"modules/aaw-games-aventyr/Setting-images/corpse-cactus-reduced-240x300.webp\" width=\"240\" height=\"300\" />\n<p> This plant closely resembles its cousin, the firebloom cactus, but though it has a similar size and shape as well as brown skin, short hairs, and an odor of honey, it offers anything but safe respite. Once a creature touches the trunk and brushes up against the hairs of this desert flora, spines shoot out from inside the trunk (Atk +2, 1d2 points of piercing damage + DC 15 Fortitude save or paralyzed and 1d3 Constitution drain per round). Once injected into the victim the spines inject a paralytic poison that traps the creature in place while the tree siphons all nutrients and when its prey is unconscious or dead, the overgrowth on the tree opens and vine-like tendrils grab the body, slowly pulling it up and placing it prone on top of the corpse cactus. Here the plant sucks the victim bone dry, adding the remaining bulk to its “sun shield”.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h3>Waternut Tree</h3>\n<p>Of the little vegetation that persists in the Scorched Lands, the waternut tree is arguably the most important plant of them all. This tall (15-20 ft.) thorny, thin, leafy tree produces hanging sacks of an edible nut used heavily in wasteland cuisine. The top of the tree has giant, white leaves that canopy the trunk and fruits during a Transgression, following the Shard like a sunflower.</p>\n<p>The sack of a waternut is more valuable than the nut itself, as approximately 2 gallons of fresh water can be found within. One tree can produce as many as 10 hanging sacks (the fruiting time is approximately 5 days) by utilizing a symbiotic relationship with fire grass, an algae always found around the plants. The waternut tree uses its white leaves to capture the rising steam from the fire grass and it cools the underside of the large leaves as it condenses, protecting the leaf but also allowing it to absorb the extra water. One waternut sack of water is capable of producing a 15 ft.-wide patch of fire grass (and therefore capable of producing at least 5 more waternuts).</p>\n<h3>Fire Grass / Fire Algae</h3>\n<p>Fire grass is an algae that grows symbiotically with the waternut tree, covering the ground around the plant in a 15-ft.-radius patch that resembles a low grass or moss, but with a rust or reddish hue. Absorbing water from the waternut sacks when they fall to the ground, fire algae undergoes a process called photosynthetic replication, reproducing astonishingly fast with very little consumed energy. When the Transgression occurs, fire grass’ high water content burns off before the algae itself, releasing steam all around the waternut tree. Fortunately, fire algae is not harmful to most creatures, though it often convinces creatures and travelers unfamiliar with the Scorched Land that the water from a waternut tree is not to be trusted.</p>\n</div>","markdown":""},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{"core":{"sheetClass":""}}},{"sort":650000,"name":"Regional Unique Characteristics","type":"text","_id":"P5eOWITiKf5XaG1a","title":{"show":false,"level":1},"image":{},"text":{"format":1,"content":"<div class=\"aventyr\">\n<p class=\"s5\">Regional Unique Characteristics</p>\n<h2>Weather</h2>\n<p>As normal weather patterns pass into the Scorched Lands they quickly dissipate in the intense heat over the sands, sometimes disappearing without a trace but not always; it is not unheard of for powerful rain and thunderstorms to rip through the region whipping up dust walls, ash clouds, and even leaving pools of ashen sludge that can swallow unsuspecting travelers. In areas that receive heavier amounts of rain the ash and sand congeal to form semiliquid lakes of viscous slag called morasses.</p>\n<p>The Transgression over very wet environments such as large bodies of water, oceans, and swamps, has effects that are somewhat unique. The rapid rise in temperature produces a large amount of steam and water vapor, and the heat currents can often cause steam spouts to form—these tornadoes of vaporized boiling water are quite dangerous and have been known to sink many a ship. In general, the Transgression over water creates a tremendous amount of airborne moisture, most of which becomes steam that creates a thick mid-level fog that helps to abate the power of the Transgression near the cost. In swampy areas, this increased moisture creates a super-dense growth zone on the immediate border of the Transgression path, and many areas downwind of a seaside zone are incredibly lush and fertile, having daily tropical rainstorms creating a perfect environment for an abundance of plant and animal life in an otherwise inhospitable region.</p>\n<h2>Dangers and Effects</h2>\n<p>While the Shard of the Sun scorches the land below and destroys most life, a strange residual effect occurs in the Scorched Lands where its touch graces Aventyr—the entire zone is affected by a permanent endure elements spell. Any creature that spends at least 10 minutes in the Scorched Lands’ borders are affected by this phenomena and it lasts until 24 hours are spent outside of the zone, minimizing any heat dangers except during the direct Transgression (dangerous temperatures only exist for 5 minutes before and after the Shard’s direct passing; no environmental checks are required outside of this time.) During this daily period of intense heat, Fortitude saves against the environment need to be made by creatures involved in strenuous activities (such as combat) in an exposed area but are otherwise unnecessary. During the direct Transgression as temperatures rise to greater than 240° F (115° C), unprotected creatures must make a Fortitude Save (DC 15 +1 per previous check) or take 10d6 points of damage (half damage on a successful save). Half of this damage is considered fire damage and the other half is untyped. The direct Transgression lasts for 66 seconds (11 rounds). Any creature slain by the Shard must make a DC 20 Will save or be affected by the Ashen Death (see Table SL-1: Ashen Death).</p>\n<p>@UUID[Compendium.world.aventyr-campaign.9I3JbSmo7P7Jezpw]{Ashen Death Table}, @UUID[Compendium.world.aventyr-campaign.oTOEMdCaf6UgfKqV]{Transgression Mutations table}</p>\n<h2>Ashen Template (CR varies)</h2>\n<p> </p>\n<img style=\"float:right;margin:0px 15px 15px 0px;border:0px\" src=\"modules/aaw-games-aventyr/Setting-images/scorched-lands-transgression-jpeg.webp\" width=\"279\" height=\"192\" />\n<p> When a creature other than an undead is destroyed by the Shard of the Sun, it has a chance to rise as an unintelligent undead zombie with the ashen template.

Back in their homelands they celebrate a festival day but in reality, a dark truth lies below the joyful tidings—the magic that keeps the Shard of the Sun in orbit around the planet fades over time and only the ritual performed during the Shedding keeps the Shard from crashing into the planet, destroying all life. While it has gone uninterrupted for over a thousand years each time it is always marked by terrible death and suffering among the elite of Timaeus.</p>\n<p>A normal Transgression lasts for 66 terrifying seconds, but a Shedding lasts for an excruciating 666 seconds and bake the surface with such an immense heat that no tool has survived measuring it (though estimates place the temperature between 600° and 800° F (315–426° C). Low-quality swords and armor have been known to melt to slag, anything made of wood instantly combusts, and unprotected objects vaporize into ash.</p>\n<p>After a Shedding, the earth is cracked and parched dry, like the shedding scales of a world-sized snake. The first winds bring about terrible ash storms that have lasted for days. Even worse are Morasses, formed when rainstorms sweep in after a Shedding (turning all that ash to liquid stone). If there was any benefit at all to the Shedding it is that after it ends, fresh pools of sun magic can be harvested all over the Scorched Lands.</p>\n<h3>Sun Magic</h3>\n<p> </p>\n<img style=\"float:right;margin:0px 15px 15px 0px;border:0px\" src=\"modules/aaw-games-aventyr/Setting-images/AAW-IgneaousGlaive-color-01-193x300.webp\" width=\"193\" height=\"300\" />\n<p>Sun magic is a remnant of The Shedding, energy so dense that it takes physical form as a glowing orange liquid hot enough to burn unprotected skin (2d6 fire damage for each round of exposure). With careful preparation, however, it can be handled safely, charged into prepared crystals which other magical devices use as power. Though it can be found in the Scorched Lands where the magic of the obelisk ritual connects with the Shard, the rain of magic continues across the ocean into the deadlands and across northern Timaeus (and even further east into the ocean).</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h3>Protections Against the Shard</h3>\n<p>Many creatures have adapted to protect themselves from the harshness of the Shard’s rays, searching for ways to survive the yearly terror of the Shedding. Intelligent species were quick to adapt and many techniques for survival remain unchanged for centuries.</p>\n<p>Finding a zone of safety from the Shard (at least a 5 ft. square of full cover) can be a matter of life or death during a Transgression and though simply staying out of the direct rays of the Shard can save your life, without protections there is still great danger from exposure. While in cover with no other protections during a Transgression (which lasts 11 rounds) a creature takes 1d6 points of nonlethal damage per round.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<img style=\"float:right;margin:0px 15px 15px 0px;border:0px\" src=\"modules/aaw-games-aventyr/Setting-images/Celurian-Air-Scarf-276x300.webp\" width=\"217\" height=\"236\" />\n<h3>Cool Suit</h3>\n<p>A cool suit is any suit of clothing or armor treated in sun oil that specifically covers the entirety of the body and leaves nothing unprotected exposed. Most cool suits unfurl or unwrap to cover the body like a cape in time of need, whereas others are more intricate and tailor-made to an individual’s needs—be it extra appendages, equipment considerations, or personal tastes. Once treated in sun oil the suit protects the wearer from one full exposure of the Shard, after which the concoction flakes off and the suit is no longer protected until another coating is applied (because sun oil is costly, most folks treat a cool suit as a last resort). A cool suit offers no protection against a Shedding.</p>\n<h3>Deathbed</h3>\n<p>Honed over the centuries, one of the oldest techniques for survival in the Scorched Lands is the deathbed. It entails digging a grave-like bed in the sand, laying in it, and covering oneself with at least 6 inches of material, you must have some way of breathing through the material. As the Transgression occurs temperatures rise, but underground a creature stays mostly protected. Anyone can make a deathbed within 10-12 rounds.</p>\n</div>","markdown":""},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{"core":{"sheetClass":""}}},{"sort":600000,"name":"Significant Characters","type":"text","_id":"D9UwvI6GT2kTh7UF","title":{"show":false,"level":1},"image":{},"text":{"format":1,"content":"<div class=\"aventyr\">\n<p class=\"s5\">Significant Characters</p>\n<h2> <span id=\"The_Fiery_Lady\" style=\"box-sizing:border-box\"><span style=\"font-family:Lato, sans-serif\">The Fiery Lady</span></span></h2>\n</div>\n<p><img style=\"float:right;margin:0px 15px 15px 0px;border:0px\" src=\"modules/aaw-games-aventyr/Setting-images/fire-lady-jazbee-110x300.webp\" width=\"110\" height=\"300\" /></p>\n<p> The Fiery Lady is a mystery of the Scorched Lands.

Non-Elves are unwelcome and those that refuse to leave are found, eventually, outside the Forest, their bodies savaged and left as a warning to others.</p>\n<p>Non-Elves do not know why the denizens of the Silent Forest have separated themselves from the rest of the world and those few Elves who are caught outside the forest will not answers questions about their history or their homeland even under threat of death. Only the most dire of circumstances will make an Elf divulge information.</p>\n<h1>History</h1>\n<p> </p>\n<img style=\"float:left;margin:0px 15px 15px 0px;border:0px\" src=\"modules/aaw-games-aventyr/Setting-images/Sabriel2.webp\" width=\"256\" height=\"363\" />\n<p>The Elves believe that almost at the Prime Event of the universe, light was created and it spread throughout the heavens, bringing life to countless worlds. As the universe attempted to create balance, darkness was created as well. They believe that these two equal and opposing forces were found in @UUID[JournalEntry.dOJJ8mRNTPtoihmF.JournalEntryPage.leuKpASroHy7r6sn]{Naraneus}, who became the Dark Goddess of the Drow, and her twin sister @UUID[JournalEntry.dOJJ8mRNTPtoihmF.JournalEntryPage.oyFVdicDq8mbjOWw]{Naneth}, who would become the Mother Goddess of the Elves.</p>\n<p>Many centuries ago, when the Silent Forest was still relatively young, the surface Elves and what would become known as the @UUID[JournalEntry.QlctNkzE9injOde9.JournalEntryPage.8HyVcZ70eyhwNJsu]{Drow} lived together, but their increasing numbers were soon going to overwhelm what the forest could provide. Rather than the different factions descending into violence, their deities did in their stead.</p>\n<p>According to the surface Elves, Naraneus began a campaign of war against her sister that was so continuous and all-consuming that when the now-divided groups came to blows, Naraneus ignored the pleas of the Drow to concentrate on her own battles. The Drow, in desperation, turned to other gods, but they didn’t answer the Drow either. The Elves showed no quarter as the Drow had begun the fight and the Drow were forced to flee. The Drow call this The Dismissal. The Elves call it The Banishing.</p>\n<p>After nearly a thousand years, Naraneus broke off her war with Naneth and returned to the Drow, teaching them of the darkness that she represented. Naneth took time to reflect upon the activities of the past thousand years and began teaching her priests and priestesses that if the Elves could not trust their own kin, they couldn’t trust anyone outside their kin.</p>\n<p>Trade relations with the @UUID[JournalEntry.QlctNkzE9injOde9.JournalEntryPage.t4LZuyNruvzneOHD]{Dwarf}, @UUID[JournalEntry.QlctNkzE9injOde9.JournalEntryPage.myrc4omqUaiD3RKZ]{Halfling}, and @UUID[JournalEntry.QlctNkzE9injOde9.JournalEntryPage.lMtTJxWecu1ISdP0]{Gnomes} suddenly ceased. There was no response from envoys sent to the Elves. Even the Orcs had no relations with the Elves. The entire society retreated into Edhellond, turning solely to hunting and agriculture and forsaking any trade with any other races.</p>\n<p>At first, diplomats from various races were simply rebuffed and told to leave the forest with very little information. As the other races sent bolder envoys to the Silent Forest, the envoys returned with even less information and more threats to stay out of Edhellond. Eventually, they stopped returning altogether.</p>\n<p>Knowing that trusting the other races was all but impossible, but understanding that knowledge of the other races activities was important, Patriarch Celeion Taltaur sent some spies to infiltrate the Human and Orc communities and others to keep tabs on the other races. These spies are trained in the art of disguise and use every magical means available to them to remain hidden. These spies are replaced every few years, but they remain hidden within those communities and their information is invaluable.</p>\n<h1>Government</h1>\n<p>Edhellond is a theocracy, ruled by a Matriarch or Patriarch. When the current ruler dies, every Cleric, Paladin, and Monk dedicated to @UUID[JournalEntry.dOJJ8mRNTPtoihmF.JournalEntryPage.oyFVdicDq8mbjOWw]{Naneth} goes into a weeklong meditation. Upon awaking, the member of the clergy that can perform a miracle determined to be from Naneth herself becomes the new Matriarch or Patriarch.</p>\n<p>At the time the Matriarch or Patriarch assumes the throne, they select what is called the Warden. Upon death of the Matriarch or Patriarch, the Warden takes control of the throne until a miracle is produced.</p>\n<p>The current leader, Haewel Birron, became the Matriarch when she brought rain to the fields of crops that border the eastern edge of the forest in a time of great drought. This was unusual because the rain came from inside the forest instead of from the sky. She is married to @UUID[.segjH3vhBwQjfdag#arfindiel]{Arfindiel}, an extremely gifted metalsmith who learned the trade from his ancestors, who learned from the @UUID[JournalEntry.QlctNkzE9injOde9.JournalEntryPage.t4LZuyNruvzneOHD]{Dwarf} before the Banishing.</p>\n<p>A Cleric of Naneth who could have become the Matriarch or Patriarch advises the ruler. The current advisor is @UUID[.segjH3vhBwQjfdag#erilanwen,-advisor-to-the-matriarch]{Erilanwen}, a militaristic Cleric of Maethor Naneth .</p>\n<p>Every Matriarch or Patriarch keeps a Wizard or Sorcerer on his or her staff as well. This spellcaster is usually chosen by the advisor, but may be chosen by the ruler. The current spellcaster is @UUID[.segjH3vhBwQjfdag#tacaeon]{Tacaeon}.</p>\n<h1>Cities</h1>\n<p>There are no cities in Edhellond, though there are the remnants of some outposts that lay in ruins. The Elves learned early on that building structures, such as guard posts or even villages simply gives other races a place to establish a stronghold within the Silent Forest. There are hundreds of campgrounds that are used by the patrols within the Forest, but they contain no buildings and usually only a firepit and a place to pitch a tent if needed.</p>\n<h1>Capital</h1>\n<p>There is no capital, per se, of Edhellond. The closest approximation to a capital is Tal (pronounced tahl), which is a shrine to Naneth that is in the middle of Edhellond. Elven legend states that Naneth appeared to Sabarwen Haeelwa, the first Matriarch of the Elves, and told Sabarwen to begin settling an area around a extremely large maple tree. This area is surrounded by a group of treants who have sworn loyalty to the position of the Matriarch or Patriarch.</p>\n<h1>Patrols</h1>\n<p>Specific patrols watch the borders between Edhellond and the @UUID[Compendium.Aventyr-Campaign-Setting.aventyr-campaign.QVrlu0lTv2vFtT5P]{Klavek Kingdom} to the north, the Scorched Lands to the south, and the uncharted territories to the west. General patrols move throughout Edhellond on a regular basis.</p>\n<p>Patrols through Edhellond consist of roughly a dozen warriors and contains at least one individual proficient in a few languages or that has the ability to cast the tongues spell. These patrols also keep a sharp eye out for any type of shape changing magic for something they can use to help their spies stay hidden.</p>\n<p>Spellcasters in these patrols refrain from large, flashy spells, such as lightning bolt, and prefer to use spells like detect thoughts, cause fear, and most use mind-controlling magic to get invaders to leave and not return. They also use spells that alter memories to get invaders to forget anything they have seen, as well as certain psychoactive fungi that are grown near the sea where Edhellond borders the Scorched Lands.</p>\n<p>Each patrol group has two members who carry horns, which are blown in the event of combat. This sound attracts Elves within hearing range. Two separate members of the party carry scrolls of sending, one of which is used at the same time the horns are blown. This scroll is used to contact the Matriarch and inform her of what is occurring, along with approximate position and the number of enemies.</p>\n<p>When the Matriarch receives a sending, she alerts the @UUID[.segjH3vhBwQjfdag#the-teu-circa-(the-silver-sickles)]{Teu Circa, the Silver Sickles}. If the number of enemies is large or battle turns quickly against the defenders, the Sickles will ride into battle upon permanently hasted dire boars. Each member of the Sickles wears a ring of sending to allow constant communication between the group and the Matriarch.</p>\n<h2>The Teu Circa (The Silver Sickles)</h2>\n<p>The Teu Circa are the personal bodyguards for the Matriarch and the internal police force for Edhellond. This group is made up of eleven members, one of each class. The leader of the Sickles, @UUID[.segjH3vhBwQjfdag#tanna,-leader-of-the-tau-circa]{Tanna }in this case, is always a Paladin of @UUID[JournalEntry.dOJJ8mRNTPtoihmF.JournalEntryPage.oyFVdicDq8mbjOWw]{Naneth}.</p>\n<p>Each member of the Teu Circa owns a dire boar that that member raises from the birth of the boar to be a steed and companion. These boars are permanently hasted and have no fear of carrying their rider into battle. Under no circumstances will a boar of the Sickles carry any other rider.</p>\n<p>Both boars and Sickles serve the Elven ruler until death.</p>\n<h1>Religion</h1>\n<p>Elves are monotheistic, worshipping a dual goddess, @UUID[JournalEntry.dOJJ8mRNTPtoihmF.JournalEntryPage.oyFVdicDq8mbjOWw]{Naneth}. Naneth has two faces that Elves will pray to, depending on their class or their situation. Naneth represents the warming, protective, maternal side of light as Asaya Naneth, the Leaf Mother, while also representing the harsh, destructive side of light as Maethor Naneth, the Warrior Mother.</p>\n<p>Death in Edhellond is a somber event. As the Elves consider each other to be family, regardless of lineage, a death is almost always mourned forest wide. A death in Edhellond is treated with respect, but more so if the deceased was a member of the @UUID[.segjH3vhBwQjfdag#the-teu-circa-(the-silver-sickles)]{Teu Circa} or an important member of Elven society. The most respect is reserved for the Matriarch or Patriarch.</p>\n<p>The funereal rite of the Elves is called “returning to Mother.” It involves wrapping the deceased in leaves, having the body blessed by the Matriarch or Patriarch, and buried beneath the roots of a tree. This allows the body’s decomposition to assist the tree in growing, as the chemicals of the body are taken up by the tree.</p>\n<p>When warfare was more common, the rite of blessing and burial was performed by the closest cleric or paladin of Naneth. As the clerics and paladins did not carry enough leaves to wrap bodies in, they pinned a single leaf to the garments of the deceased and buried them below he nearest tree when time permitted.</p>\n<h1>Ruler</h1>\n<p>The current Matriarch of the Elves of the Silent Forest is Haewel Birron. As per Elven custom, when the previous rule, Patriarch Umiel Firwen, passed away, Haewel joined the other clerics, paladins, and monks in trying to bring forth a miracle to see whom the new leader would be. Haewel managed to conjure rain to bring water to the crops that border the eastern edge of the Silent Forest, but this rain came from inside the forest instead of the sky, marking her as the new ruler of Edhellond. What makes her more unusual is that she is just past middle age, making her the youngest Matriarch in recorded Elven history.</p>\n<p>She is a potent healer, but tempers her healing abilities with common sense; if you are hurt during battle, she is the first to offer aid. However, if your injuries are your own doing from lack of forethought, she will have one of her clerics heal the most grievous wound, but leave the rest to heal on its own.</p>\n<p>Matriarch Haewel is the daughter of a female Cleric of Maethor Naneth and a jeweler.</p>\n<h1>Significant Characters</h1>\n<h2>Tanna, Leader of the Tau Circa</h2>\n<p>Tanna was born in the southern portion of Edhellond to two clerics of <span style=\"font-family:Signika, sans-serif\"><span style=\"color:rgb(25, 24, 19);font-family:Signika, sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-variant-ligatures:normal;font-variant-caps:normal;font-weight:400;letter-spacing:normal;orphans:2;text-align:start;text-indent:0px;text-transform:none;white-space:normal;widows:2;word-spacing:0px;-webkit-text-stroke-width:0px;text-decoration-thickness:initial;text-decoration-style:initial;text-decoration-color:initial;display:inline !important;float:none\">Maethor</span></span> @UUID[JournalEntry.dOJJ8mRNTPtoihmF.JournalEntryPage.oyFVdicDq8mbjOWw]{Naneth}. As she grew, she took to the teachings of her parents, but instead of simply worshipping Naneth, Tanna wanted to show others the glory of the Warrior Mother.</p>\n<p>To do this, she trained as hard as she could, pushing herself past limits she wasn’t aware she had, both physically and spiritually.</p>\n<p>When Tanna was at her physical peak, she became the apprentice to Eenthi, the (then) leader of the Tau Circa. He taught her to trust her mind as well as her heart, teaching her the dirty tricks that other races use and how to counter them. He tempered her spirit with reality. He formed her into the woman she is today; tough, no-nonsense, and practical, but still filled with the wonder of Naneth.</p>\n<p>She has an unwavering loyalty to Matriarch Birron, but places the safety of the Elven lands above even that of the Matriarch and will not hesitate to question decisions made at the throne.</p>\n<h2>Erilanwen, Advisor to the Matriarch</h2>\n<p>Erilanwen is the current advisor to Matriarch Birron and a Cleric of Maethor Naneth.</p>\n<p>Born in Tal, Erilanwen was orphaned at age twenty-five when his parents we killed during a wild bear attack. Before this happened, both of his parents taught him the ways of Asaya Naneth. After the attack, his attitude changed and he found himself gravitation toward Maethor Naneth.</p>\n<p>As he aged, he became a cleric of Maethor Naneth, but found that he retained some of his parents’ teachings regarding Asaya Naneth. While he does still feel anger for his parents being killed, he has tried to find a balance between the two aspects of Naneth within himself. Although he is prone to anger-filled outbursts, he is also capable of great caring and empathy. He tries to lend these qualities in his advisement of the Matriarch.</p>\n<h2>Arfindiel</h2>\n<p>Two things that Elves excel in are magic and art and foremost in Edhellond among goldsmiths is Arfindiel.</p>\n<p>Arfindiel learned goldsmithing from his parents who in turn, learned it from time spent with the @UUID[JournalEntry.QlctNkzE9injOde9.JournalEntryPage.t4LZuyNruvzneOHD]{Dwarf} before the Banishing and the closing of the Edhellian borders.</p>\n<p>Born with a minor talent for magic, Arfindiel surpassed his parents in his talent for manipulating precious metals.</p>\n<p>When he approached Haewel Birron, he brought to her what he considers his greatest work: a holy symbol of Naneth. The leaf is made of copper colored green, with the edges and veins of the leaf made of platinum. The arrow is made from pieces of one of Haewel’s own arrows, the arrowhead made from pure gold and fletching made of silver. She carries it to this day as her own holy symbol.</p>\n<p>Arfindiel stays out of the politics that his wife is engaged with. He prefers to stay out of the limelight and create new artistic pieces.</p>\n<h2>Tacaeon</h2>\n<p>Tacaeon is young, barely into adulthood. His age and enthusiasm belies his sorcerous abilities.</p>\n<p>His magic appeared to Tacaeon very early, as he was passing into his thirties. Instead of settling down with a tutor, of which there were many, Tacaeon’s parents encouraged him to practice his own. He took to magic as the proverbial duck to water.</p>\n<p>Tacaeon has a small workshop near Tal that he calls his “hutch.” Inside, he is almost constantly experimenting, a sign indicating such is hung on the door of the hutch.</p>\n<p>Haewel chose him as her advisor due to his age. As everyone around her has the experience of many years, most of them have lost Tacaeon’s fresh, unadulterated view of the world.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n</div>","markdown":""},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"sort":0,"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{"monks-enhanced-journal":{"appendix":false},"core":{"sheetClass":""}}}],"_stats":{"systemId":"dnd5e","systemVersion":"2.1.4","coreVersion":"10.291","createdTime":1663485627864,"modifiedTime":1675658459788,"lastModifiedBy":"EsIYTtNnjwxUbKOG"},"_id":"wVQiwLZtRuaqbpFA","ownership":{"default":0,"R5IsvMTH5P79pBoG":3},"folder":"j9cXBagzZ1ARsO2I","sort":1400000},{"name":"Timaeus","pages":[{"name":"Timaeus","type":"text","_id":"hnQDgK0SceEGQoUn","title":{"show":false,"level":1},"image":{},"text":{"format":1,"content":"<div class=\"aventyr\">\n<p class=\"s5\">Timaeus</p>\n<img style=\"display:block;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto\" src=\"modules/aaw-games-aventyr/Setting-images/TIMAEUS-750x539.webp\" width=\"489\" height=\"474\" />\n<p>To the outside world, Timaeus looks like an idealistic place. Every man, woman and child has magical talent, their military is a precision machine, and they are ruled over by the wisest and most powerful wizards in the known world—the Obelisk Order. However appearances aren’t everything, and like many perfect things, its interior tells another story entirely.</p>\n<p>Timaeus is mostly a peaceful place due to a perpetual military presence and because the citizenry lives under the constant fear of the living dead, as well as a government that keeps both the populace and their soldiers in check. Secrets are not to be spoken aloud, and any troublemakers or revolutionaries are quickly tracked down and executed.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<img style=\"float:left;margin:0px 10px 10px 0px;border:0px\" src=\"modules/aaw-games-aventyr/Setting-images/Final-Eventual-c-gary-dupois-timaen-mage-232x300.webp\" width=\"232\" height=\"300\" />\n<p>It is true that every natural-born citizen of Timaeus is taught magic as early as they can read, but this is done both out of desperation as it is out of inborn talent; any children who reach the age of eight without proof of magical ability are stolen from their homes, never to be seen again. Though no more than one in a dozen youths is taken this way, many mothers make deals with planar creatures and outsiders just to ensure their child has magical potential.</p>\n<p>Likewise, the military has proven itself to be exceptional—for nearly a thousand years it has been in a perpetual war against the undead surging from the deadlands and the army shows little sign of wearing thin. Yet despite this bravery, the country is fragmented into six orders, six armies struggling for control against both the undead and one another—instead of uniting as a unified force.</p>\n<p>Worst of all is the Obelisk Order themselves. When they stopped the shard of the sun they were unarguably the most powerful and wisest wizards in the world; but that was centuries ago and in that time they have calcified, becoming shells of their former selves who can do nothing but continue their eternal ritual. Without the clear guiding force of the Obelisk Order themselves, Timaeus borders on self-destruction. As the leaders of the six armies become increasingly obsessed with the minutiae of citizens everyday life for the slightest advantage over the others, they become ever blinder to the dangers massing both within and without the country’s borders.</p>\n<h1>History</h1>\n<p><strong>Year –813:</strong> The Timaeus Academy is founded by six explorer-wizards that feel the ley-lines at the site were extroardinary and would encourage magical growth amongst students of magic.</p>\n<p><strong>Year –784</strong>: The city of @UUID[.OYj59KJky98HgcM7#maeus]{Maeus} is settled around the Timaeus Academy.</p>\n<p><strong>Year –731:</strong> As settlers expand through the brushlands, more and more children are born with magical talents until eventually, nearly every citizen of the nation develops magical powers.</p>\n<img style=\"float:right;margin:0px 10px 10px 0px;border:0px\" src=\"modules/aaw-games-aventyr/Setting-images/Academic-Town-Color-F-245x300.webp\" width=\"245\" height=\"300\" />\n<p><strong>Year –598:</strong> Feuds between the masters of the Timaeus Academy lead to the devastating Campaign of Roses, killing thousands. The remaining masters build an obelisk in the courtyard of the academy as a memorial, naming themselves the Obelisk Order so they will never forget the dangers of untapped magic.</p>\n<p><strong>Year –219:</strong> The Black Halls appears from out of nowhere, within sight of Maeus.</p>\n<p><strong>Year –1:</strong> @UUID[.EVR6caNc4jmcLjmb]{Mek’Madius} is cast out of the Obelisk Order.</p>\n<p><strong>Year 0:</strong> The Obelisk Order send the Shard of Sun into orbit rather than allowing it to crash into and destroy Aventyr. The resulting ritual levels the original Timaeus Academy, killing dozens of promising wizards and destroying thousands of years of arcane knowledge. Energy released by the event alters the local geography, creating the Scorched Lands to the west and the @UUID[.OYj59KJky98HgcM7#the-deadlands]{deadlands} that will come to define the northern border of Timaeus.</p>\n<p><strong>Year 16:</strong> @UUID[.hnQDgK0SceEGQoUn#the-six-orders]{Six orders} are founded, one for each remaining member of the Obelisk Order. Their leaders look entirely to one member of the order for guidance however with each annual ritual that passes, they are more difficult to reach and their responses become shorter and more cryptic.</p>\n<p><strong>Year 108:</strong> The undead surge forth from the deadlands, razing cities and destroying the countryside as they go. @UUID[.uPbpU972uzF4TxuE#the-order-of-the-blade]{The Order of the Blade} mounts the first Warmblooded Campaign to drive the undead back into the deadlands, establishing four border fortresses in so doing.</p>\n<p><strong>Year 391:</strong> The undead again surge from the deadlands, showing amazing cognitive ability as they overtake each of the border fortresses one at a time, almost entirely eliminating the @UUID[.uPbpU972uzF4TxuE#the-order-of-the-blade]{Order of the Blade} in a defeat now known as the Red Plague.</p>\n<p><strong>Year 393:</strong> The Second Warmblooded Campaign begins the grueling task of driving the undead back north, into the deadlands. Martial Law is declared and the military @UUID[.uPbpU972uzF4TxuE#the-order-of-the-shield]{Order of the Shield} takes official control of the country.</p>\n<p><strong>Year 418:</strong> The Second Warmblooded Campaign succeeds in freeing most of northern Timaeus from the grasp of the undead. However, constant border skirmishes lead to perpetual casualties, forced enlistment, and the creation of the first reanimates.</p>\n<p><strong>Year 463:</strong> @UUID[.uPbpU972uzF4TxuE#the-order-of-the-shield]{The Order of the Shield }declares the country is safe only to have a surging of undead destroy yet another northern settlement. The shamed order is ousted by the newly rebuilt @UUID[.uPbpU972uzF4TxuE#the-order-of-the-blade]{Order of the Blade}, who take the offensive into the deadlands to put down the growing threat.</p>\n<p><strong>Year 497:</strong> @UUID[.uPbpU972uzF4TxuE#the-order-of-the-blade]{The Order of the Blade} proves that at least some of the undead raised within the deadlands cannot be permanently destroyed by any known means. In an effort to prevent another Red Plague they begin a practice that lasts to this day of daily raids into the deadlands to destroy any unliving blight they see.</p>\n<p><strong>Year 901:</strong> In an effort to raise dwindling morale and reduce growing bureaucracy, the Order of the Blade raises all @UUID[.uPbpU972uzF4TxuE]{six orders} back to equal status once more. Though their goals remain the same as they once did, each is now little more than a specialized military unit. Martial law and waves of forced enlistment remain an uncontested fact of everyday life for all but those with the longest memories.</p>\n<h1>Timean Naming</h1>\n<p>Though popular names vary widely from year to year, nearly all Timean given names are two distinct syllables. In the Common tongue, the short pause between characters is commonly represented by a hyphen, though individuals occasionally choose to spell their name without, such as the infamous @UUID[.EVR6caNc4jmcLjmb]{Mek’Madius}.</p>\n<p>Timean surnames are often only a single syllable and when formally written are placed before the given name, and separated by a hard pause (represented in the Common alphabet by an apostrophe).</p>\n<h2>Timean Male Names</h2>\n<p>Do-Ius, Mad-Kyun, Sun-Hyun, Syung-Won, Ja-Kyun</p>\n<h2>Timean Female Names</h2>\n<p>Amin-Jin, Min-Sao, Son-Yeo, Ji-Hei</p>\n<h2>Common Timean Surnames</h2>\n<p>Car, Kai, Ra, Mek, Nan</p>\n</div>","markdown":""},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"sort":900000,"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{"monks-enhanced-journal":{"appendix":false},"core":{"sheetClass":""}}},{"name":"The Six Orders","type":"text","_id":"uPbpU972uzF4TxuE","title":{"show":true,"level":1},"image":{},"text":{"format":1,"content":"<div class=\"aventyr\">\n<p class=\"s5\">The Six Orders</p>\n<p>The government of Timaeus is broken down into six orders; @UUID[.hnQDgK0SceEGQoUn#the-order-of-the-rose]{the Rose}, @UUID[.hnQDgK0SceEGQoUn#the-order-of-the-staff]{the Staff}, @UUID[.hnQDgK0SceEGQoUn#the-order-of-the-wand]{the Wand}, @UUID[.hnQDgK0SceEGQoUn#the-order-of-the-shield]{the Shield}, @UUID[.uPbpU972uzF4TxuE#the-order-of-the-blade]{the Blade}, and @UUID[.uPbpU972uzF4TxuE#the-order-of-the-cloak]{the Cloak}. Each represents one of the members of the Obelisk Order and is in theory run by them—though they haven’t been consulted in generations. In practice each order is run by its own @UUID[.uPbpU972uzF4TxuE#timaen-terminology]{jang} (pronounced “yang”) who vie for dominance over one another as often as they work together. They all promote from entirely within their own ranks, and each jang chooses their own successors personally—often establishing their replacements decades before they intend to need one in case of an untimely “accident”.</p>\n<p>Though the organizational structure of each order is different, they have all been known to hire mercenaries and assassins from outside the country both publicly and clandestinely (to accomplish deeds they do not want to be associated with doing themselves).</p>\n<h2>The Order of the Rose</h2>\n<p> </p>\n<img style=\"float:right;margin:0px 10px 10px 0px;border:0px\" src=\"modules/aaw-games-aventyr/Setting-images/order-of-the-rose-300x300.webp\" width=\"231\" height=\"231\" />\n<p>The most diverse of the orders, its leader @UUID[.UPVEdWjUv9JYfjX1#nanmin-jun]{Sojang Nan’Min-Jun} manages dozens of subordinates each of whom oversees magical distribution and use amongst one or more trades and professions across the country. He is a patient man but has a terrible temper when provoked, and he insists that all contracts be signed in blood, openly carrying a special bloodletting knife with him at all times to ensure such a rite is always carried out.</p>\n<p>Min-Jun also manages all imports and exports from the country—which is little. Timaeus primarily acquires few foreign goods (only a small amount of food) and publicly trades nothing though secretly, they do sell the occasional skyship or magical weapon to those wealthy enough to afford it. The Order of the Rose also serves as the country’s semi-underground information network. They encourage both loyalty and fear amongst the populace, requiring under fear of punishment that people report unusual amounts of magical usage from their friends and neighbors—or any other suspicious activity. Information about those who are potentially misusing their magic or otherwise might be troublemakers is typically passed to the Order of the Cloak, who then act on information that proves reliable.</p>\n<h2>The Order of the Staff</h2>\n<img style=\"float:right;margin:0px 10px 10px 0px;border:0px\" src=\"modules/aaw-games-aventyr/Setting-images/order-of-the-staff-67x300.webp\" width=\"67\" height=\"300\" />\n<p>The official mandate of the Order of the Staff is to oversee and improve the arcane schools across Timaeus, a duty which the order has performed with stellar efficiency for generations. However, the order’s control extends far beyond simple magical knowledge—they strive to control all information both within and without the country.</p>\n<p>Their leader, @UUID[.UPVEdWjUv9JYfjX1#longkai-kyun]{Hanjang Long’Kai-kyun}, manages this task first by throttling information that the citizens of Timaeus receive. Educational programs available to the common citizen stress loyalty to the six orders, the flawlessness of their leaders, and the chaos and evil of the world outside Timean borders. Though Kai-Kyun is undoubtedly a genius when it comes to information, he is absolutely useless when it comes to dealing with people. He squirrels himself away in a library nearly all of every day, emerging only to review the decisions made by his six trusted sangjwa’s (pronounced “sane-wah”) who head the six major academies, one of which is Timaeus Academy itself.</p>\n<p>To keep out false knowledge the order maintains a fierce presence in every port town and landing, upholding a strict policy on border crossings—namely that as little of it happens as possible. Total isolation is beyond their reach, however, so instead they sell trade and travel permits to foreigners (so long as they don’t appear to be spreading false messages of the government or the outside world) and hire them as mercenaries for the Order of the Blade.</p>\n<p>Despite the overall quality of the schools run by the Order of the Staff, few outside those who join the order are ever allowed access to them. Those not born within Timaeus must pay a small fortune each year to be allowed to study within any of their hallowed halls, and those who are must pledge their life in the order’s service.</p>\n<h2>The Order of the Wand</h2>\n<img style=\"float:right;margin:0px 10px 10px 0px;border:0px\" src=\"modules/aaw-games-aventyr/Setting-images/order-of-the-wand-300x300.webp\" width=\"219\" height=\"219\" />\n<p>As long as there have been opinions, there have been those who force them upon others. Nowhere is this less true than the Order of the Wand, who constantly monitor the population for any sign of general distress before working to quiet it—by any means necessary. What this usually means, however, is that they spread propaganda, stage fake uprisings elsewhere, or otherwise seed the population with the false idea that nothing is wrong, or that acting on anything they feel is wrong will not end well.</p>\n<p>Any major operation is led directly by @UUID[.UPVEdWjUv9JYfjX1#mikmin-hei]{Sojang Mik’Min-Hei} herself; she has always been a master of making people see things her way, though on the exterior she rarely gives off even a sliver of emotion herself.</p>\n<p>When dealing with smaller-scale operations that focus only the removal of one or two targets they typically defer to the @UUID[.uPbpU972uzF4TxuE#the-order-of-the-cloak]{Order of the Cloak}, and they encourage citizens to speak to the @UUID[.hnQDgK0SceEGQoUn#the-order-of-the-rose]{Order of the Rose} instead of themselves. Though it is a rarity to see their agents in action, the Order of the Wand does employ a number of specialized evokers and enchanters to perform operations themselves when no other alternative is available.</p>\n<h2>The Order of the Shield</h2>\n<img style=\"float:right;margin:0px 10px 10px 0px;border:0px\" src=\"modules/aaw-games-aventyr/Setting-images/Drekons-Kite-Shield1-copy-162x300.webp\" width=\"162\" height=\"300\" />\n<p>The longest-standing military order in Timaeus, they control the majority of the country’s navy as well as a small fleet of skyships (alongside other mobile units) capable of crossing the ocean or the deadlands at any time in defense of the country. Officially, the Order of the Shield is also a religious order who worship a variety of deities, notably amongst them @UUID[Compendium.Aventyr-Campaign-Setting.aventyr-campaign.dOJJ8mRNTPtoihmF.JournalEntryPage.zNH5DtHDKD52Ufaf]{Onael}, @UUID[Compendium.Aventyr-Campaign-Setting.aventyr-campaign.dOJJ8mRNTPtoihmF.JournalEntryPage.QiPqpoNg3jLKKBlu]{Hado} and Xio—gods of law and of war. The order’s daejang takes this devotion to the pantheons of combat extremely seriously, and Il’Mad-Kyun is considered a zealot by most and a bully by all.</p>\n<p>Mad-Kyun has done an effective job at keeping external threats at bay with his posturing and regular threats against any nation near enough to listen; he’s been known to threaten to adjust the Obelisk Order’s ritual just enough to shift the location of the Scorched Lands so that it destroys anyone who might oppose him or Timaeus. None are sure if he actually has this power, but it is certain that if he were to do such a thing, much of the world would unite against Timaeus to prevent Aventyr’s destruction at the hands of a madman. Despite Mad-Kyun’s bizarre fanaticism, he also cares deeply for his pets and those under his command he is directly responsible for. He has half-dozen servants each for his horse, his battle-turtle, and his wolf-hound, all of whom must be ready for battle at a moment’s notice.</p>\n<h2>The Order of the Blade</h2>\n<img style=\"float:right;margin:0px 10px 10px 0px;border:0px\" src=\"modules/aaw-games-aventyr/Setting-images/sword-rick-h3-128x300.png\" width=\"128\" height=\"300\" />\n<p>The country’s second standing army, the Order of the Blade, exists solely to handle internal threats. Primarily they fight the undead from the @UUID[.OYj59KJky98HgcM7#the-deadlands]{deadlands} but they are also responsible for managing banditry and natural beasts of all kinds. They are led by @UUID[.UPVEdWjUv9JYfjX1#haikal-sean]{Daejang Hai’Kal-Sean}, a bastion of honesty and loyalty within a government known to be self-serving. He fights to protect the people the best he can and is seemingly tireless in his efforts. He sees law and goodness as inseparable, and any who seek to undermine the law are perceived as evil no matter the reason.</p>\n<p>Though the order is led by battle wizards and other combat focused mages, the Order of the Blade is the most diverse of the six orders. They have units of wizards, entire companies of immigrant mercenaries, and most interestingly, companies who must fight without the aid of any magic at all, accompanied by battle-tortoises equipped with 10 ft. tall crystals that radiate antimagic. These antimagical units are officially intended to fight rogue spellcasters and army deserters, yet whispers abound that these are the kidnapped children that lack any magical talent of their own.</p>\n<h2>The Order of the Cloak</h2>\n<img style=\"float:right;margin:0px 10px 10px 0px;border:0px\" src=\"modules/aaw-games-aventyr/Setting-images/cloak-rich-h1-144x300.png\" width=\"144\" height=\"300\" />\n<p>The most secretive of the cabals that rule the country, the Order of the Cloak doesn’t have a visible presence in Timaeus and instead works through spies, assassins, and covert agents within the other orders. Despite this, their actions are easily recognized and whenever a person is found mysteriously dead or missing, none doubt who is responsible. To outside inquirers they are led by @UUID[.UPVEdWjUv9JYfjX1#koamin-jin]{Bimiljang Ko’Amin-Jin}, a patient and arguably evil woman who wears a mask and black cloak when out in public. Yet it is rumored that Amin-Jin, and thus the entire order, takes her orders from some other entirely secret, true jang not known outside the upper echelon of the order—perhaps one as alien as the black halls where Amin-Jin is frequently seen.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<h1>Timaen Terminology</h1>\n<p>While the Timean military is structured similarly to militaries elsewhere in the world, they use uncommon naming conventions.</p>\n<h4><strong>Jang (“yang”)</strong> The general and leader of an order.

Some of these include The Festival of Darkness—celebrated on the day the Shard of the Sun is furthest from Aventyr, 140 days after The Shedding—and the Rain of Petals, which celebrates the greatness of the six jangs.</p>\n<h1>The Shedding</h1>\n<p>Once each Shard Year the Obelisk Order perform a ritual to channel energy from five huge crystals surrounding @UUID[.n71mdJTU3DzXqram#the-pentagram]{The Pentagram}, sending a visible pillar of light up into the sky to strike the Shard of the Sun in an explosive event known as The Shedding. During the Shedding even the safest areas within the deadlands become utterly uninhabitable as raw energy rains from the sky. This energy (known as sun magic) is later collected and used to charge the crystal pillars once again—and much more besides.</p>\n<p>Despite the devastation (which is very localized, mostly to the Scorched Lands), this event is celebrated akin to the new year with all fervor and excess usually associated with annual holidays of renewal—one of the few days of the year that such excitement is encouraged by the six orders. Huge feasts are conjured and made freely available to anyone within any of Timaeus’ major cities, foreigners and citizens are allowed to mingle (though not entirely freely), and merchants and craftsmen of all sorts migrate into the cities (which are normally followed by a week of major mercantile activity across the country).</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>Sun Magic</h2>\n<img style=\"float:left;margin:0px 10px 10px 0px;border:0px\" src=\"modules/aaw-games-aventyr/Setting-images/Sun-stock-art-modified-224x300.png\" width=\"201\" height=\"269\" />\n<p>Sun magic is a remnant of @UUID[.n71mdJTU3DzXqram#the-shedding]{The Shedding}, energy so dense that it takes physical form as a glowing orange liquid hot enough to burn unprotected skin. With careful preparation, however, it can be handled safely, charged into prepared crystals which other magical devices use as power. Though it can be found in the Scorched Lands where the magic of the obelisk ritual connects with the Shard, the rain of magic continues across the ocean into the deadlands and across northern Timaeus (and even further east into the ocean).</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>The Tortoise Migration</h2>\n<p>The day after @UUID[.n71mdJTU3DzXqram#the-shedding]{The Shedding}, the massive crystals are taken from the perimeter of the @UUID[.n71mdJTU3DzXqram#the-pentagram]{Pentagram} and loaded onto trains of tortoises to begin their journey across the countryside to collect the fallen sun magic. The beginning of this migration is seen with much fanfare, as it is never known exactly how long the tortoises will be away from the city for (though it is rarely less than half a year). In addition to the five heavily guarded crystal tortoises, dozens if not hundreds of more mundane merchants and travelers begin their own, lesser migrations across the countryside. Many of them ride tortoises of their own that are similar to the crystal tortoises, complete with large crystals destined to be charged with @UUID[.n71mdJTU3DzXqram#sun-magic]{sun magic} and then reforged into magical items and weapons.</p>\n<h2>Giant Tortoises</h2>\n<p>Huge tortoises have been native to Timaeus since the original wizards settled here. Over the generations, they have been largely domesticated—though it still takes great effort to raise and train one to properly take a rider. They are commonplace amongst the orders but demand exorbitant prices elsewhere, easily thousands of gold pieces at bare minimum; this price is only logical, however, as it takes nearly five years for a hatched tortoise to reach the physical and mental maturity required to carry a rider, and the beasts can live for hundreds of years. The oldest known tortoise is over 400 years old and lives in a comfortable pen in one of the magical academies in Maeus.</p>\n<h2>The Pentagram</h2>\n<p> </p>\n<img style=\"float:right;margin:0px 10px 10px 0px;border:0px\" src=\"modules/aaw-games-aventyr/Setting-images/p04-pentagram-sade-300x290.webp\" width=\"226\" height=\"218\" />\n<p>All that remains of the original Timaeus Academy, this massive pentagram is effectively frozen in time, protected by powerful magic. Without extensive protection, one cannot even approach the Pentagram itself, where the Obelisk Order continues their perpetual ritual to keep the Shard of the Sun’s orbit stable. Nearly a hundred feet outside the Pentagram are five large pits home to huge, charged crystals that multiply in number as the time for @UUID[.n71mdJTU3DzXqram#the-shedding]{the Shedding} draws near, marking the border of where it is safe to approach without magical defenses.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<h1>Timean Religion</h1>\n<p>Unlike so much else in Timaeus, citizens are allowed to freely worship any god they choose so long as they do not disrupt the flow of society around them. Despite this freedom, much of the country praises gods of magic and warfare—the aspects that touch their everyday lives. The most commonly worshipped deity is @UUID[JournalEntry.dOJJ8mRNTPtoihmF.JournalEntryPage.o7Bl7XnxenERvjAq]{Xio}, the Eternal Combatant. The people pray to him daily to keep the war at the fringes, so that their warriors may someday go to join the battle, rather than the battle come to them.</p>\n</div>","markdown":""},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"sort":1100000,"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}},{"name":"Timean Technology","type":"text","_id":"W0FN1UQoEGs8vYzZ","title":{"show":false,"level":1},"image":{},"text":{"format":1,"content":"<div class=\"aventyr\"><p class=\"s5\">Timean Technology</p><img style=\"float:right;margin:0px 10px 10px 0px;border:0px\" src=\"modules/Aventyr-Campaign-Setting/Setting-images/Image_Portfolio_107_Fantasy-Jason-Walton-67-126x300.jpg\" width=\"126\" height=\"300\" /><p>Populated by wizards and literally overflowing with magic, Timaeus boasts many incredible and unusual advances in both science and magic, their discoveries far advancing many others elsewhere in Aventyr. Some of these inventions have become commonplace throughout the world (such as the interposing hand series of spells) whereas others are merely commonly known (like the skyships), while some are far-flung rumors far beyond where they are invented (unique constructs are a common example but there are numerous others). While most of these creations are magical in nature, some are entirely technological—for instance, firearms, while still rare, are an accepted part of life within Timaeus.</p><p>@UUID[.uPbpU972uzF4TxuE]{The six orders}, especially the @UUID[.uPbpU972uzF4TxuE#the-order-of-the-staff]{Order of the Staff}, keep a close eye on civilians developing new technologies and have been known to regularly confiscate or destroy anything that might be too dangerous (a questionable practice that has been the source of no small bit of derision from the more liberal-minded mages). Despite the routine destruction of small villages or devastation wrought by experimentations gone awry, the people accept the practice without much complaint; those that do not quickly find themselves in the sights of the orders.</p><h2>Skyships</h2><p>Known as airships, skyshells, and by countless of other monickers, skyships are found almost exclusively within the Timean capital of Maeus where the power to keep them airborne is most readily available. Typically crafted from the shells of gigantic tortoises reinforced by magic, common skyships are 60 ft. long and hold a crew of four comfortably. Far larger ones do exist, of course, that can hold hundreds of soldiers at once—though all such vessels are currently based within the @UUID[.uPbpU972uzF4TxuE#the-order-of-the-shield]{Order of the Shield’s} imposing armory. Most skyships are able to travel about three times as fast as a man can run (180 ft. speed), though as larger airships exist so do faster ones. The fastest one known to exist was known as The Tera-Bolt, which could travel faster than the eye could see; however, it disappeared over twenty years ago and hasn’t been seen since.</p><table style=\"width:100%;height:730.953px\" border=\"1\"><tbody><tr style=\"height:28.2188px\"><td style=\"background-color:rgb(0, 0, 0);width:99.8714%;height:28.2188px\" colspan=\"6\">&lt;<span style=\"color:rgb(255, 255, 255)\"><span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">Statistics for Dungeons &amp; Dragons 5th Edition</span></span></td></tr><tr style=\"height:666.297px\"><td style=\"background-color:rgb(247, 141, 167);width:99.8714%;height:666.297px\" colspan=\"6\"><h3>Black Arrow</h3><p>Long, narrow, and entirely black, a Black Arrow is an exceptionally uncommon ship in the Timean air force.

These creations span every facet of existence from humans with extra limbs, to chimerical connections of a dozen different creatures, or oozes that can shift in and out of the Material Plane.

While the land isn’t quite as blasted and desolate as it is to the west, the deadlands remain a dry and dangerous place—particularly where the @UUID[JournalEntry.wVQiwLZtRuaqbpFA]{Silent Forest} to the north suddenly ends in a line of dry scrub and withered trees, all of which are thick with undead that appear utterly indestructible.</p>\n<img style=\"margin:0px 10px 10px 0px;border:0px;float:right\" src=\"modules/aaw-games-aventyr/Setting-images/goblin_dog_bg__matt_bulahao-deadlands-timaeus-300x225.webp\" width=\"259\" height=\"194\" />\n<p>The deadlands define Timaeus’ northern and only, land-based border, and they find little objection from the elves that they claim the land as theirs—the lithe folk are happy enough to grant the country of mages their isolation without complaint. Though the blasted sands technically border the Silent Forest to their north, the undead within seem to have a particular hatred of Timaeus and surge south in unending waves, forcing large armies to field just keep the hordes at bay. These armies are primarily stationed around four border fortresses: two of which have been recovered and remade from the first Warmblooded Campaign, and two of which have been rebuilt larger and stronger after their respective destructions. Despite the danger of such an endeavor, some few trading routes through the region persist, heavily patrolled by members of the @UUID[.uPbpU972uzF4TxuE#the-order-of-the-blade]{The Order of the Blade} and @UUID[.uPbpU972uzF4TxuE#the-order-of-the-rose]{The Order of the Rose}</p>\n<h3>Kuchang</h3>\n<p>Visible for miles around because of the titanic obsidian slab that shadows the town, this settlement is the only well known, living collection of humanoids within the deadlands. Kuchang serves as a trading post for what little commerce exists between Timaeus and the @UUID[JournalEntry.wVQiwLZtRuaqbpFA]{Silent Forest}—mostly importing food in exchange for charged sun crystals. Save for a few days of the year around @UUID[.n71mdJTU3DzXqram#the-shedding]{The Shedding}, the town is sheltered from the worst of the Sun Shard’s magic by the thick slab of stone looming overhead, and protected from the undead by swarms of tiny golems. For the week on either side of the Shedding, the settlement is populated only by reanimates and constructs—beings safe from the fatal energy that rains from the sky.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Nyamo\">Nyamo</span></h2>\n<p>A port town founded long before Timaeus’ self-imposed isolation, this city sees a great deal of travel by those passing around Cape Fin. Nyamo is defined by the titanic wall down its center, separating the city into two parts—one for the Timean citizens, and the other where travelers and merchants may land and trade. Passage through the singular, huge gate is strictly regulated by the @UUID[.uPbpU972uzF4TxuE#the-order-of-the-staff]{The Order of the Staff}, but rumors persist of catacombs beneath the city used by smugglers of both goods (and more dangerously, ideas). For more detail see @UUID[.iUOrRhLyDdg71ghA]{Nyamo}</p>\n<h2>Maeus</h2>\n<p>The capital of Timaeus is constructed unlike nearly any other city on Aventyr, with the most developed areas around the border of the city, and the least desirable and dilapidated areas towards to the center with each tier of buildings approaching @UUID[.n71mdJTU3DzXqram#the-pentagram]{the Pentagram} seeing more and more wear.</p>\n<h2>Wyosani</h2>\n<p>What was formerly a salt mine has exploded into a prosperous mining city when 40 years ago they broke into an undiscovered series of caverns beneath their existing mines, containing titanic crystals of the sort used across the nation for crystalline items. The depths of these new caverns have yet to be fully explored or plumbed, but they have been searched for decades now seemingly without end (though rumblings can often be felt deeper below, prompting fears of a response from the Underworld).</p>\n<h2>Opongi Range</h2>\n<p>These large, white, almost cubic mountains have dominated western Timaeus for longer than the lands have been settled. Some believe they are the bones of a god or other ancient and titanic creature—others say they are abandoned alien structures riddled with never-used chambers to scale with the mountains themselves—but explorers that trek there rarely return to confirm any of these rumors.</p>\n<h2>Mek’Madius’ Plateau</h2>\n<p>Though few know the actual location of his lair, the locals rightly believe this steppe is the home of the seventh (exiled) member of the Obelisk Order—the lich @UUID[.EVR6caNc4jmcLjmb]{Mek’Madius}. The Timean government give the mountain a wide berth, though adventurers and treasure-hunters do occasionally strike out towards the plateau, and some have later returned to bring torment to the towns they had visited preparing for their journey.</p>\n<h2>Thick Isles</h2>\n<p>Not officially settled by Timaeus, these islands are each dominated by a volcanic mountain surrounded by thick and supposedly untamable jungle, much of which is inhabited with dangerous and strange creatures. Despite these obvious challenges, the islands are a regular harbor for fugitives and rebels fighting against the Timean government and each holds a handful of heavily armed camps along its shores. Some even claim to have made alliances with the insectoid natives (creatures that call themselves dromites and have strange powers over the mind).</p>\n<h2>Cape Fin</h2>\n<p> </p>\n<img style=\"margin:0px 10px 10px 0px;border:0px;float:left\" src=\"modules/aaw-games-aventyr/Setting-images/animated_object__eric_quigley-300x220.webp\" width=\"300\" height=\"220\" />\n<p>The peninsula jutting south off Timaeus towards Picollo is home to many harbors; with the exception of @UUID[.OYj59KJky98HgcM7#nyamo]{Nyamo} they are barred and magically protected from all foreign traffic.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h2><span id=\"The_Hanne\">The Hanne</span></h2>\n<p>Nearly separating the country in two, the Hanne River flows southwest and northeast before turning south again into the ocean.

Of note among the tributaries are the Imihanne in the north and the Namihanne in the south.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"The_Scorching_Sea\">The Scorching Sea</span></h2>\n<p>Named for the way the sea boils each day as the Shard of the Sun passes overhead, the sea to the west of the country is known to be home to thousands of undead sea creatures and more bizarre monsters besides. Strangely these creatures are never seen south of the tip of @UUID[.OYj59KJky98HgcM7#cape-fin]{Cape Fin}, though none have identified a clear reason for why the monsters contain themselves to their established territories.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Maeus-2\">Maeus</span></h2>\n<p> </p>\n<img style=\"margin:0px 10px 10px 0px;border:0px;float:right\" src=\"modules/aaw-games-aventyr/Setting-images/Image_Portfolio_107_Fantasy-Jason-Walton-61-126x300.jpg\" width=\"126\" height=\"300\" />\n<p>Despite the near destruction of the city during the cataclysm that was the first Shedding, Maeus has been rebuilt and has risen from a center of learning to a metropolis of wonders. Commonly considered the most magical city in the world, it boasts its wealth and prosperity with magical displays on every street corner accompanied by impossible buildings in nearly every block.</p>\n<h3><span id=\"The_Black_Halls\">The Black Halls</span></h3>\n<p>After appearing mysteriously just outside of @UUID[.OYj59KJky98HgcM7#maeus$1]{Maeus} 1,500 years ago, this structure has been thoroughly searched and found to be an utterly empty complex save for a number of lethal traps. Most people today give the enigmatic building a wide berth but the @UUID[.uPbpU972uzF4TxuE#the-order-of-the-shield]{The Order of the Shield} (and some say the@UUID[.uPbpU972uzF4TxuE#the-order-of-the-cloak]{The Order of the Cloak}) use it as a prison for particularly dangerous convicts, having long discovered the magical incantations to seal or unseal nearly any door and window in the building.</p>\n<h3><span id=\"Everyday_Wonders\">Everyday Wonders</span></h3>\n<p>Even the poorest citizen of Timaeus has the advantage of Timaeus’ excess of magic. Eternally flaming crystals stand on tall posts every 50 ft. along each major road, as well as at intersections of smaller roads. Wells that produce their own water (known as everwells) can be found interspersed around the city, some able to produce hot or cold water on demand.</p>\n<h3><span id=\"Traveling_Houses\">Traveling Houses</span></h3>\n<p>Typically small, these buildings are in high demand where they exist. They maintain permanent magic portals to all other traveling houses throughout @UUID[.OYj59KJky98HgcM7#maeus$1]{Maeus} and specialize in teleportation to related guilds and structures across the country of Timaeus.</p>\n<h3><span id=\"New_Timaeus_Academy\">New Timaeus Academy</span></h3>\n<p>A sprawling affair that dominates an entire spoke of the city stretching from the @UUID[.OYj59KJky98HgcM7#old-timeaus-academy]{Old Timeaus Academy} all the way to the edge of the city, this institution is constantly bustling with activity. It serves not only as an academy and place of learning, but as a center for experimentation and innovation. This is also the primary birthplace of reanimates and the regional headquarters of the @UUID[.uPbpU972uzF4TxuE#the-order-of-the-staff]{The Order of the Staff}. Regardless of the vastness of the academy, enrollment is low, likely due to the restriction that only those who are approved by the Order of the Staff may attend.</p>\n<h3><span id=\"Old_Timeaus_Academy\">Old Timeaus Academy</span></h3>\n<p>Once a huge building sprawling over several acres of land, this ruin has been left untouched since the Campaign of Roses, save for the five-story tall obelisk standing in what was once the main courtyard, engraved with the names of all those lost. Aside from the general danger of being so near to @UUID[.OYj59KJky98HgcM7#the-pentagram]{The Pentagram} itself, ancient magical experiments left abandoned have a tendency to occasionally malfunction, releasing monsters into the streets or into the so-called Archive. The sprawling series of tunnels that once served as a vault and library for the academy now houses monsters, lost treasures, and more; many say the complex expands with each passing year, along with all the glory, riches, and power it offers..</p>\n<h3><span id=\"Cathedral_of_Shadow\">Cathedral of Shadow</span></h3>\n<img style=\"margin:0px 10px 10px 0px;border:0px;float:right\" src=\"modules/aaw-games-aventyr/Setting-images/Image_Portfolio_107_Fantasy-Jason-Walton-77-300x190.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"190\" />\n<p>Large, square, and utterly dark, no public entry is allowed into this imposing structure through the single door that faces out to the street. The sight of black-robed figures entering or leaving only give credence to the rumor that the building is one of, if not the main, headquarters for the @UUID[.uPbpU972uzF4TxuE#the-order-of-the-cloak]{The Order of the Cloak}. Locals know that questioning the figures ends in bloodshed and not answers, and thus give them a wide berth.</p>\n<h3><span id=\"The_Pentagram-2\">The Pentagram</span></h3>\n<p>Several hundred feet across, the Pentagram is where the Obelisk Order continue their eternal ritual to keep the Shard of the Sun in orbit. The structure radiates heat and energy comparable to the sun itself, and standing too close leaves one’s skin dry and sore. The corners of the Pentagram are comprised of five huge pits, each of which normally holds numerous clear crystals charged with sun magic the ancient mages will use at the next Shedding.</p>\n<p> </p>\n</div>","markdown":""},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{"core":{"sheetClass":"core.JournalTextTinyMCESheet"}}},{"sort":1400000,"name":"Nyamo","type":"text","_id":"iUOrRhLyDdg71ghA","title":{"show":false,"level":1},"image":{},"text":{"format":1,"content":"<div class=\"aventyr\">\n<p class=\"s5\">Nyamo</p>\n<p>Nyamo is a walled city; aggressive outside threats necessitated the construction of a sturdy barrier hundreds of years ago. Originally designed to repel intruders, it now serves a slightly different purpose—as the settlement became a center of commerce, traders from all over the world arrived in Nyamo to sell their wares and exchange ideas. While the goods and money were welcome, the ideas were not.</p>\n<img style=\"float:left;margin:0px 10px 10px 0px;border:0px\" src=\"modules/aaw-games-aventyr/Setting-images/Image_Portfolio_107_Fantasy-Jason-Walton-74-300x190.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"190\" />\n<p>The visiting merchants and migrants were mostly housed in the migrant district, which was composed of the majority of the northern half of the city. Construction began on a new section of the Nyamo Wall that effectively split the city in half, running down the middle and connecting each end to the original outer wall. Taller and thicker than the original wall, the huge gatehouse built into its center gave each side of the barrier its own portcullis.</p>\n<p>Traffic between the sections of the Nyamo Wall is strictly regulated—in order to pass, one must provide an acceptable reason, a gate tax must be paid, and a stamp issued. Those wishing to stay overnight must obtain permission and purchase a special permit to do so. Guards from the @UUID[.uPbpU972uzF4TxuE#the-order-of-the-staff]{The Order of the Staff} search each and every person that passes through the gate, ensuring that no contraband makes its way into Nyamo (normal magic items are not illegal, but may not pass through the gate; these must be surrendered or passage is also prohibited.) Usually travelers are given the option of simply turning around and not passing through the Nyamo Wall if they do not wish to surrender their items—in this city of Timaeus, this is just the cost of doing business. Those that pass through the gate are often followed by a member of the Order of the Staff, who make careful notes on interactions they make and often follow up questioning where searches occur (often using Nyamo scribe orbs).</p>\n<p>Those that wish to enter the city from outside must go to the Migrants’ Gate on the outer wall (unless they are a Timean citizen) where they are still subject to search and seizure, declaring all of their enchanted items; undeclared magic items are subject to confiscation. Those that wish to stay more than 24 hours must apply at the gate or at a Timean embassy for a permit, and anyone found entering the city under false pretenses are subject to expulsion or arrest. Only Timean citizens are allowed entry through the Timerian Gate. They must present the proper papers and declare any magic or valuable items obtained outside of Timaeus. Generally speaking, most citizens comply and seizures at this gate are rare.</p>\n<p>When the Nyamo Wall was constructed, the sewers under the city were modified, blocking passages with bars and grates, and in some cases blocking tunnels altogether. Over the years enterprising smugglers and other criminal elements have reopened some of these sealed passages to facilitate the burgeoning black market in Nyamo. While some goods are sold, it is most often news of the outside world that is traded, as well as books and other forms of publication. Several competing guilds operate underneath the Nyamo Wall, including those that support revolution; simple thievery and smuggling are often overlooked, with the occasional blatant offender caught and made an example of.

In preparation for the arrival of the Shard of the Sun, he preached its benefits—the obtainment of unlimited energy, the power which would assist the high mages and all of Timaeus in dominating any foes that would dare to stand against them. The Obelisk Order vehemently opposed Mek’Madius’ stance and voted unanimously to revoke his place on the council; he was thrown out onto the street with the commoners, where he began to plot his revenge.</p>\n<p>As the Shard of the Sun grew closer to impacting the planet and Aventyr’s annihilation seemed imminent, the Obelisk Order marched north in a final attempt to intercept and destroy the incredibly powerful relic. Keeping to the shadows and using a potent artifact to remain undetected, Mek’Madius followed behind with nine of his former and most trusted apprentices, scheming to gain as much power as he could from the Shard of the Sun while stopping the Obelisk Order’s plans. The exiled mage was aware that his power alone would be insufficient to enact his revenge, but a mass sacrifice using souls to fuel his magic would give him a definite advantage over his former comrades.</p>\n<img style=\"float:left;margin:0px 10px 10px 0px;border:0px\" src=\"modules/aaw-games-aventyr/Setting-images/MekMadius-Hideout.webp\" width=\"342\" height=\"443\" />\n<p>The Obelisk Order arrived at the projected impact location of the Shard of the Sun, solemnly faced one another, and began the most powerful spell ever cast by mortals. Just as the rogue relic appeared overhead, Mek’Madius sacrificed his nine apprentices and began a powerful spell of his own. Utterly focused on their ritualistic arcane protections and the Shard of the Sun, the mages were unable to stop the exiled wizard as he channeled the soul energy into a powerful absorption spell, attempting to siphon off a portion of the magical and radiant energy from the Shard. But Mek’Madius’ evil and selfish acts came with a price—as a fragment of the powerful relic broke off and tumbled toward the earth, Mek’Madius’ very soul was drawn into the fragment. His selfishness and reckless abuse of power had transformed him into an undead creature, permanently bound to the fragment and destined to experience his unintended mortality in utter isolation.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>Fragment of the Sun Phylactery</h2>\n<p>Mek’Madius’ phylactery is not one he made by choice—his reckless use of souls to power the absorption spell failed to siphon all the power from the workings of the Obelisk Order, instead, channeling only some of the energy back through his own soul. At the same time as he completed his energy absorption, the mages repelled the Sun Shard from impacting the planet, causing fragments to break off.</p>\n<p>One of the largest fragments reflected the energy absorption back into Mek’Madius, pulling his soul out of his body and into the sky before slamming his essence into the sundered piece of the Shard of the Sun as it plummeted toward Aventyr. He had been transformed into a Lich, and the fragment of the Shard of the Sun his phylactery. The entire event was a complete mistake but he soon would come to see this curse as a blessing in disguise.</p>\n<p>The fragment stands at a height of seven feet and weighs 500 lbs.

For most of its past the region was home to no more than tribes of boggards and barbarians; their primitive lives changed some 900 years ago when Tranak Blackscale made the swamp his domain. A @UUID[.IdjkM3iKo5NPY1zu#black-dragons]{black dragon} with a passion for cruelty for its malicious sake, he enslaved creatures from the swamp to fulfill his wicked needs and amassed a veritable army of thralls. Over the centuries Tranak sired several children with different mates, all of whom met a grisly end when he decided they had outlived their usefulness (and more importantly, his interest). Eventually, the brood grew too large and Tranak’s children settled across the swamp in their own domains, quickly coming to blows with each other in skirmishes kept to a minimum by the overwhelming presence of their draconic father.</p>\n<p>So it was until the year 497 when Tranak’s slaves rebelled against his tyrannical rule, forming a loose rebellion of swamp creatures under the @UUID[.IdjkM3iKo5NPY1zu#bog-trolls]{bog troll} Theeble Dead-eye. The dragon and his children fought together in what they perceived as an easy battle, but when Tranak and his two eldest were brought low by what the legends describe as a powerful secret weapon wielded by an unknown barbarian chieftain from an unnamed tribe, the six remaining children took flight and hid deep in the swamplands. Soon the alliance crumbled and boggards, trolls, and humans took up the roles they had before the arrival of Blackscale, fighting over small stretches of dry land in the otherwise inhospitable swamp.</p>\n<p>101 years after his death Tranak’s children revealed their presence to the tribes of the swamp—all six dragons swept through it sowing death and destruction everywhere they went. In the following years, the dragons started to fight amongst themselves over territory and slaves, their conflicts occasionally shaking the swamp as two or sometimes more knocked each other’s massive bodies across the landscape. In 665 Satthruphar was killed in one such battle with @UUID[.JuqcYkrHQOMobwTy#hatrumak]{Hatrumak}, Tranak’s eldest remaining son. Upon realizing that they themselves were the biggest threat to their dominion, the dragons signed a magical treaty drawn by Hatrumak, dividing the swamp into five regions with a small area deemed neutral to all. Each laired in one of the different regions with the resources in each territory belonging to the dragon within though today the swamp still sees battles between the children of Blackscale (rare as these occurrences may be).</p>\n<p><br />Not a hundred years after the Treaty Draconis, an innkeeper named Teth Aslody found a dry area east of the swamp near the Yerek Steppes; here he founded an inn named @UUID[.Tdkqx23iD22AVlLv]{Cherrian’s Rest}. It quickly became popular amongst the people traveling around the swamp until one day a small fire resulted in a massive explosion and the establishment burned down. That conflagration resulted in the discovery of black gold, an ebony sludge found naturally in the swamp that seems to feed flames—soon an export business was organized. The inn was rebuilt and a small community grew up around it; Teth died five years later and his nephew, Iramar, inherited Cherrian’s Rest along with his father’s share of the black gold operation. He set about making the enterprise much more effective and therefore profitable, and after a few years Iramar and the merchant families—which have shares in the operation—founded the Black Gold Consortium. These traders pretty much run the town of Cherrian’s Rest today, despite the mayor and council’s faulty belief of authority.</p>\n<h1><span id=\"History\">History</span></h1>\n<p><strong>Year –1200</strong><br />The mysterious ruins in the north of the Vast Swamp are abandoned by their equally mysterious builders.<br /><strong>Year –1100<br /></strong>The first human tribes settle in the Vast Swamp; they are quickly drawn into conflict with the boggards and trolls of the area.

While the dragons are considered the government in their respective regions, in Cherrian’s Rest a mayor and a council run the town—though the Black Gold Consortium is never left out of the loop and nothing happens unless they have been asked for their opinion, a thing Magistrate Alexander Gelmar is only too happy to give.</p>\n</div>","markdown":""},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{"core":{"sheetClass":"core.JournalTextTinyMCESheet"}}},{"sort":400000,"name":"Geography","type":"text","_id":"oIbJsrbNZu7GVWp9","title":{"show":false,"level":1},"image":{},"text":{"format":1,"content":"<div class=\"aventyr\"><p class=\"s5\">Geography</p><p>The Vast Swamp is in many ways unremarkable from other regions like it, filled with bogs and mangrove trees. Along the torn coast the water slowly progresses from salty to brackish, eventual filtering into freshwater that pervades the six distinctive regions of the swamp. While the dragons that live in five of the regions are of the same type, their individual desires and interests have shaped their abodes into vastly different landscapes over the course of a few centuries. Below are short introductions to each region, each bearing the names given in the Treaty Draconis.</p><h2><span id=\"The_Tangled_Forest\">The Tangled Forest</span></h2><p>The domain of @UUID[.JuqcYkrHQOMobwTy#hatrumak]{Hatrumak }(the eldest of Tranak Blackscale’s surviving children, and an accomplished necromancer in his own right) is by far the darkest and most twisted of the draconic realms in the Vast Swamp. Once home to beautiful, serene scenes with mangrove trees and colorful birds, today plants stand in stale pools of poisonous swamp water, the vivid avians long gone. The closer to Hatrumak’s lair one journeys the more poisonous the landscape gets but before any travelers can get too close, they have to deal with the tribes of ghouls that prowl through the landscape. When Hatrumak drafted the Treaty Draconis he gave himself the northern part of the Vast Swamp: serene, vibrant bogs where Satthruphar was said to have her lair.<br />None of Blackscale’s offspring wanted the northern reaches, an area deemed worthless by Hatrumak’s siblings, but the dragon discovered ancient, mysterious ruins close to the border with @UUID[JournalEntry.RMK7HBFDlPXDiURg]{Naera Cull}. Hatrumak believes that the legendary secret weapon that killed his father is somehow connected to those ruins, and he deliberately killed Satthruphar to take over her domain before drafting the Treaty Draconis to ensure he could study his findings without interference from his siblings. If his brothers and sisters were to find out that he engineered the whole incident leading to the Treaty Draconis to further his own agenda, they would immediately move against him. However, should Hatrumak’s theories on the ancient ruins prove to be correct and should he discover the mysterious weapon, his siblings will be in for a surprise indeed.</p><h3>Ancient Ruins</h3><p>In the north of the @UUID[.oIbJsrbNZu7GVWp9#the-tangled-forest]{Tangled Forest} are the mysterious remnants of an ancient city; none know who built it, or even how or why they did so. The half-submerged grey stone buildings lead to stone corridors that pierce deep into the swamp (some still dry, whereas others have been flooded for centuries). Most of the markings on the ruins have eroded into unrecognizable shapes, although the word Frothor is clearly visible on several buildings and its meaning continues to elude @UUID[.JuqcYkrHQOMobwTy#hatrumak]{Hatrumak}. The dragon has been actively trying to capture adventuring bands to force them to explore the area for him in exchange for their freedom (an offer he has yet to keep his word on) and a few months ago one such band brought back a stone depicting a battle between dragons and several different humanoid shapes. In his excitement Hatrumak almost forgot to eat the adventures, though his vile servants quickly remedied that mistake.</p><h2>Mire of Poison</h2><p>Nestled in between the Tangled Forest and the Torn Coast lay a region home to the highest concentration of rare and poisonous plants—the ad-hoc realm of the self-appointed Queen of Poison, @UUID[.JuqcYkrHQOMobwTy#allunhandra]{Allunhandra}. Far and away the most elusive of the brethren of Tranak Blackscale, she is rarely seen; when she is observed, it is mostly by ships as she flies out over the coast and turns north. No one knows where she goes after that, most believing that she merely patrols her domain. The truth is far darker than mere roaming, however, as Allunhandra is, in fact, the notorious procurer of poisons for several cults all over Aventyr (where she goes by the name Granny Death, after her guise of a mild-looking elderly woman).</p><p>Allunhandra always travels under invisibility when flying over the Aventyr mainland but sometimes she does not cast the spell until well out over the Bay of Genthor. She does not care much for what her siblings are up to so long as they do not meddle in her affairs. Tranak always saw something special in his youngest daughter—it was she who traveled in human guise across the Vast Swamp to poison the barbarian chieftain who killed her beloved father while the rest of his children hid and cowered in fear. The dragon slayer’s death was not enough, however, and she watched with glee as the entire tribe succumbed to the poisoned drinking water. Allunhandra prefers humans as servants but even her most trusted minions do not know that she is, in fact, Granny Death. The dragon’s pride and joy is a small laboratory in which several captured alchemists slave away to produce new and potent toxins for their mistress.</p><h3>Queen’s Garden</h3><p>Amid the mangroves stand several patches of brightly colored flowers—for a few minutes they seem a natural occurrence, but with a cursory investigation it becomes clear that they’ve been cultivated as there are distinct borders between the patches, and even small pathways to get through the garden without ruining the flowers. Here in the @UUID[.oIbJsrbNZu7GVWp9#mire-of-poison]{Mire of Poison} is where @UUID[.JuqcYkrHQOMobwTy#allunhandra]{Allunhandra’s }alchemists experiment with different plants to perfect the poisons for their mistress in a small hidden laboratory somewhere nearby. These patches of cultivation are relatively new; the old garden had to be abandoned a decade ago when one of the flowers became so poisonous that in bloom it killed any creature that wandered too near. The old garden is located 5 miles to the east of the new garden, shunned by both the wildlife in the area as well as Allunhandra’s servants.</p><h2>The Muddy Mangroves</h2><p><br />The youngest of Tranak’s children, @UUID[.JuqcYkrHQOMobwTy#trymgarx]{Trymgarx} dwells in a muddy swampland so inhospitable that only boggards and other amphibians can eke out an existence. The water is always murky and dirty, the trees are dark and have patches of mud on their trunks that seems to grow bigger ever so slowly, and it is as if the land suffers from a presence vile beyond comprehension. In the aftermath of the Treaty Draconis, Trymgarx feared for his life after the death of his beloved sister Satthruphar—as the youngest he could not protect himself against @UUID[.JuqcYkrHQOMobwTy#hatrumak]{Hatrumak}, let alone avenge his sister. The dragonling sought the attention of beings powerful enough to protect him, bartering with demons he intended to be his bodyguards. It was only when the King of Mud set foot in the swamp that Trymgarx realized his mistake; the powerful hezrou had no intention of serving a dragon, instead taking Blackscale’s child as yet another trophy. Today Trymgarx the black dragon lies at the base of the King of Mud’s throne in the @UUID[.oIbJsrbNZu7GVWp9#bastion-of-filth]{Bastion of Filth} in the muddy swamp land.<br />The King of Mud sends his minions across the Vast Swamp and beyond to determine the best time for expanding his territory. The northern border of the Muddy Mangroves consists of hardened mud where the searing conditions of the Scorched Lands make the expansion impossible, prompting the King of Mud to turn his gaze south. Presently he considers the @UUID[.oIbJsrbNZu7GVWp9#the-mangrove-maze]{Mangrove Maze} a thorn in his eye, the serene beauty of the place anathema to his own domain (seeded as it is with his dangerous servants), but @UUID[.Tdkqx23iD22AVlLv]{Cherrian’s Rest} stands between the two areas and invading the neutral territory would definitely attract unwanted attention from the dragons of the Vast Swamp. These considerations leave the King of Mud with only one other route of expansion: the @UUID[.oIbJsrbNZu7GVWp9#the-tangled-forest]{Tangled Forest}. He has increased the number of scouts sent into Hatrumak’s domain, causing more and more skirmishes between the two as a predictable result. So far his the dragon has deemed the losses to his undead servants beneath his notice, and has not moved against what he perceives as the unintelligent designs of an adolescent whelp.</p><h3>Bastion of Filth</h3><p>Standing amongst the tallest specimens of the @UUID[.oIbJsrbNZu7GVWp9#the-muddy-mangroves]{Muddy Mangroves}, the Bastion of Filth pierces the green canopy with its swirling spires. The structure itself is made of wet mud that somehow still retains enough solidity to form floors and walls—it is shaped into exquisite crenellations and spires that mimic the architectural style of the grandest castles of the @UUID[JournalEntry.QVrlu0lTv2vFtT5P]{Klavek Kingdom}. Within the Bastion of Filth demons and mud elementals serve the King of Mud’s every desire, and those that displease him are dealt with by @UUID[.JuqcYkrHQOMobwTy#trymgarx]{Trymgarx} in a suitably spectacular fashion. South of the Bastion of Filth is an area covered in a pall of dragonsbreath mist; within this madness-inducing haze there is an entrance to the feared Underworld swamp, the Dar’Spelun Slugmarsh.</p><p> </p><h2>The Mangrove Maze</h2><p><br />Southeast of @UUID[.Tdkqx23iD22AVlLv]{Cherrian’s Rest} stand majestic groves of mangrove trees, an area that seems untouched by the dragon lairing within. While it is indeed inviting and bountiful in hunting, this is all a ruse to lure in unsuspecting travelers. @UUID[.JuqcYkrHQOMobwTy#kallothrax]{Kallothrax} is a devious, evil, and somewhat lazy dragon—why hunt when the prey can be led straight to him? His lair is submerged within a veritable maze of mangroves, creating a labyrinth filled by his servants; several tribes of @UUID[.IdjkM3iKo5NPY1zu#boggards]{boggards} drive unfortunate victims deeper into the maze towards the waiting dragon, where he decides if they are to be prisoners to be toyed with or food.<br />While Kallothrax tries to keep the area looking inviting to lure in prey, there are signs of draconic infestation throughout it: slightly acidic water, twisted trees, and animal carcasses half-dissolved by acid. When the dragon is not brutalizing or torturing prisoners he has been known to attack some of the boats braving his domain to get to Cherrian’s Rest. These rare raids garner him slaves, prisoners, and food, but more importantly it sates a primal need to take flight and reign destruction; after sowing chaos to his satisfaction he can turn his attention back to his cruel games, much to the despair of his unfortunate prisoners. Recently Kallothrax discovered that the lightly guarded caravans of the Yerek Steppes to be easy pickings and in the southern steppes he is spoken of in hushed whispers, “lest you speak the Black Scourge’s name and he comes for you at dusk.”</p><h3>The Dreaming Fields</h3><p>This dry area in the @UUID[.oIbJsrbNZu7GVWp9#the-mangrove-maze]{Mangrove Maze} (near the Yerek Steppes) has various flowers that give off a mild narcotic as they bloom, causing humanoids and animals to drift off into sleep. There have been a few attempts to harvest the flowers to distill them into a recreational drug, but so far nearly all of these experiments have met with failure. Hathro Dunelle was behind the latest major attempt but has instead turned his attention to the unfortunate travelers that enter the fields. His men are using magical breathing covers to protect themselves and collect the sleeping unfortunates, which then awaken in chains bound for slavery somewhere on Aventyr.</p><h2><span id=\"The_Jagged_Coast\">The Jagged Coast</span></h2><p>The southwestern coastline of the Vast Swamp consists of black rocks, a testament to prehistoric volcanic activity in the region. @UUID[.JuqcYkrHQOMobwTy#dreivantix]{Dreivantix} lairs deep within, so vile that his scales secrete a potent acid that leaks into the swamp waters, giving the bogs and marshes here slightly acidic properties (which increase in potency closer to his lair). The dragon formed the black coastal rocks himself, using his breath to make what looks like unnatural tears in the stones, as though some gigantic beast tried to claw its way into the swamp. He did so as a show of his power, terraforming the entire coastline into a testament to his strength. All of Dreivantix’s slaves display his draconic rune somewhere on their bodies, burned into their skin with claw and acid. He has no preference for a particular race of slaves—as long as they have a patch of skin to display his rune on their bodies.</p><h3>Blackstone Fortress</h3><p>This half overgrown fortress on the @UUID[.oIbJsrbNZu7GVWp9#the-jagged-coast]{Jagged Coast} is the lair of a tribe of green-scaled @UUID[.IdjkM3iKo5NPY1zu#blackstone-kobolds]{kobolds} as well as several odd assassin vines that curiously do not attack the little reptilians. Located close to the region which contains Cherrian’s Rest the fortification offers the kobolds some measure of protection from Dreivantix (who lairs closer to the coast). Blackstone fortress was originally built by a forgotten warlord as an attempt to control the area but as so many other attempts to do so, only the ruins remain today as a reminder of the folly it is to try and tame the Vast Swamp.</p><h2><span id=\"Tomb_of_Satthruphar\">Tomb of Satthruphar</span></h2><p>This stretch of swampland is named after the dragon Satthruphar. @UUID[.JuqcYkrHQOMobwTy#hatrumak]{Hatrumak} lured her into the area and over the fields of fire, then used his claws, teeth, and spells to tire her before she fell into the fields, dying in the flaming inferno as her murderous brother circled above. By chance (or misfortune) this area was also where the @UUID[.Tdkqx23iD22AVlLv]{Cherrian’s Rest }inn was founded.</p><h2>Black Gold Island</h2><p>This dry area west of Cherrian’s Rest is the premier extraction facility for the Black Gold Consortium’s operations in the Vast Swamp.</p><h2>Fields of Fire</h2><p>South of Cherrian’s Rest are massive areas of swamp so saturated with black gold that even the smallest spark can ignite them. They occasionally catch fire on their own but sometimes they get ignited by outside forces (such as in 665 when Hatrumak used them to kill Satthruphar). Unsubstantiated local legends claim the fields have been burning since before Tranak Blackscale’s arrival.</p><p> </p><p> </p></div>","markdown":""},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{"core":{"sheetClass":"core.JournalTextPageSheet"}}},{"sort":500000,"name":"Cultural groups","type":"text","_id":"IdjkM3iKo5NPY1zu","title":{"show":false,"level":1},"image":{},"text":{"format":1,"content":"<div class=\"aventyr\">\n<p class=\"s5\">Cultural groups</p>\n<h2>Blackstone Kobolds</h2>\n<p>Kobolds are quite rare in the swamp proper but where the land is dry and the conditions ripe for plunder, the kobold tricksters of Traskoria can be found. These miscreants are all originally spawned from a place dubbed “Blackstone” by the little beasties, @UUID[.oIbJsrbNZu7GVWp9#blackstone-fortress]{a large fortress} overgrown with dangerous plants such as assassin vines (though the malicious plants mysteriously do not attack the ample population of kobolds around them), in the Torn Coast region near the the border with Satthruphar.</p>\n<h2>Bog Trolls</h2>\n<p>One species of troll dominates nearly all of the vast swamp—the bog troll raider. With a range of 40 miles these nasty creatures make life miserable for every humanoid attempting to eke out an existence here. There are two types of bog trolls: hunters which live in the wild, subsisting on a diet of bog toads and giant salamanders, and raiders which are much more dangerous to travelers and band together in groups of 4 or more to attack human ships moving through the Vast Swamp. The raiders consistently find their bellies full and their hidden treasure hordes well stocked, killing, cooking, and eating humanoids only after stripping them of all valuables. Then they hide their treasure somewhere deep in the swamp, sometimes forgetting where their spoils have been concealed.</p>\n<h2>Boggards</h2>\n<p>Little is known of the boggard tribes of the Vast Swamp. Rumors persist of individuals lost in the bogs being kidnapped and sacrificed by the frog creatures to some ancient deity which has not been seen in the world for many centuries.</p>\n<h2>Ghouls</h2>\n<p>Several tribes of ghouls live in the north of the Vast Swamp, all of them under the thrall of @UUID[.JuqcYkrHQOMobwTy#hatrumak]{Hatrumak}. Ghouls can be found in all the regions but not in the same dense concentration as in the Tangled Forest.</p>\n<h2>Humans</h2>\n<p>Humans are the most predominant race of the Vast Swamp and the most unpredictable. They can fill any role in the consortium, often taking on multiple tasks in the community as well; almost every human in the swamp has worked for the Black Gold Consortium at one time or another.</p>\n<p>The human barbarian tribes who call the Vast Swamp home are as varied and diverse as humans elsewhere in Aventyr. In the @UUID[.oIbJsrbNZu7GVWp9#the-mangrove-maze]{Mangrove Maze} the Moonhowlers practice their vile hedonistic rituals, boasting a formidable proportion of lycanthropes among their number, while the Torn Coast’s Tribe of the Crocodile worships a large fiendish reptilian, and the demon-hunting Bloodclaw tribe in the @UUID[.oIbJsrbNZu7GVWp9#the-muddy-mangroves]{Muddy Mangroves} proves to be a constant nuisance to the @UUID[.JuqcYkrHQOMobwTy#the-king-of-mud]{King of Mud}.</p>\n<h2>Ratfolk</h2>\n<p>In its early years small skirmishes broke out between factions of the Black Gold Consortium—small scale warfare left the Gelmar, Asoldy, and Celfal families scrambling for soldiers. Seeing the opening niche in the swamp, a regiment of hardened ratfolk crossbow troops were employed to bolster the might of these families. The kin of the marksmen came into the swamp after their relatives decided to settle and there is now a saying: on every corner of the market in @UUID[.Tdkqx23iD22AVlLv]{Cherrian’s Rest} there’s a ratfolk peddler selling his wares (even when the gold dries up).</p>\n<h2>Halflings</h2>\n<p>Halflings are often called upon when the Black Gold Consortium needs something done in a tight spot. Small folk can often find employment cleaning or fixing in-between the cogs of extraction centers, or removing blockages in tall chimneys or long pipes; the work is always dangerous, so they expect to be paid well. The Neliton family is one of the core families in the consortium and in charge of halfling relations in @UUID[.Tdkqx23iD22AVlLv]{Cherrian’s Res}t. The family’s easy going nature has protected them from the internal conflicts of the consortium—they love to show off their strong sense of fashion. The Nelitons are the trendsetting family of the Consortium, often wearing the finest garments and jewels just to show off their lavishness and to invoke the jealousy of the other families.</p>\n<h2>Elves</h2>\n<p>Magic is used by the Black Gold Consortium to speed up extraction and enhance the efficiency of its workers, tasks excelled at by elven mages and alchemists—it spends a hefty sum to these scholars if they can provide results. @UUID[JournalEntry.QlctNkzE9injOde9.JournalEntryPage.ei36LjIhEoh87vgE]{Elves}  reluctantly take the money for their services but their true reasons for inhabiting the area remain hidden from the Black Gold Consortium. The elves’ love of nature is always paramount and the reason why they are truly working with them is to see that the business does not damage the ecosystem of the swamp. Magic means of extraction are cleaner and less damaging to the area, and there are whispers of a secret order of elven saboteurs who work towards stopping any forms of extraction that the elves do not approve of.</p>\n<h2>Half-Orcs</h2>\n<p>Usually @UUID[JournalEntry.QlctNkzE9injOde9.JournalEntryPage.7AP9WRRk8pR9xpgU]{Half-Orc} are viewed with distrust and fear, but unlike the rest of the world, in the Vast Swamp a they are regarded as a valuable asset to the Black Gold Consortium. Due to their strength, half-orcs often find work on the loading docks of the extraction facilities. Hailing from lands far away and arriving in seemingly ceaseless caravans called “Olive Wagons”, escaped half-orc slaves and half-orc wanderers alike often find new homes in the bogs and marshes of the Vast Swamp.</p>\n<h2>Tieflings</h2>\n<p>The infamous background of tieflings leaves many on the fringes of normal society but in the Vast Swamp any race is welcome so long as they have gold. Demon-touched find the swamp to be an oasis amongst a hostile world and to some the bogs even have a smell that appeals to their brimstone-tinged nostrils. Hellspawn in particular are called upon to manage many of the facilities of the Black Gold Consortium, their knack of keeping to rigid timelines and organizing even the most hectic of extraction facilities leaving them well-suited as supervisors.</p>\n<h2>Dwarves</h2>\n<p>The only @UUID[JournalEntry.QlctNkzE9injOde9.JournalEntryPage.t4LZuyNruvzneOHD]{Dwarf} living in the Vast Swamp tend to have migrated from human lands or live below ground in the Underswamp, a foul smelling place filled with the muck which drips from above and the noxious gases that fuel the flames of the Fire Fields. There are even rumors of the Black Sea, an Underworld sea made from pure oil upon which stout folk ships sail. Thus far these have proven to be rumors and exaggeration of adventurers, as the only true source of oil to date has been found by drilling in Vast Swamp itself.</p>\n<h2>Black Dragons</h2>\n<p>Five black dragons live within Traskoria (the Vast Swamp) and have done so for hundreds of years. They once warred with one another over territory and spoils but signed a magical pact two hundred years ago to divide up the region and stop the fighting. Ever since then the bogs and marshes have become much quieter, but every once in awhile one of the dragons goes on a rampage, destroying any humanoid settlements within his or her section of the realm then claiming all the riches and slaves as their own.</p>\n<p> </p>\n</div>","markdown":""},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}},{"sort":600000,"name":"Significant Characters","type":"text","_id":"JuqcYkrHQOMobwTy","title":{"show":false,"level":1},"image":{},"text":{"format":1,"content":"<div class=\"aventyr\"><p class=\"s5\">Significant Characters</p><h2>Hatrumak</h2><p><strong> (CE Male very old black dragon wizard 9) </strong>Hatrumak is fond of manipulating his servants and enjoys making adventurers do his bidding (whether through intimidation or sweet lies).</p><h2>Allunhandra</h2><p><strong>(NE Female old black dragon alchemist 7)</strong> Allunhandra is a dragon with a strength of mind that is impressive even for one of her kind.

It must be added that the tales of the rogues have become known but so far none have surfaced to verify these claims.

The Great Wyrm Tranak Blackscale reigned over all the creatures in the bogs, good and wicked, his brood growing so large that they were left with no choice but to seek out territory to the west and east. Ultimately he was defeated by a loose alliance of enslaved swamp creatures led by a courageous barbarian chieftain. After the climactic end the newly freed slaves tried to return to the ways of life they held before Tranak had claimed the area as his own. Trolls began pillaging, @UUID[.IdjkM3iKo5NPY1zu#boggards]{boggards} hid in their small mud houses as goblin tribes warred with each other, and lizardfolk clans etched out a meager existence as small bands of human merchants tried to pass around the swamp on their way to more prosperous lands in the east. Other than the building of small camps in the bogs, it was scantly touched by humans for 300 years.</p><p>The founding of a seemingly insignificant inn called Cherrian’s Rest transformed everything in the Vast Swamp. Seeing the dry portion of land in the north and noting the need for a stop along the long road taken by merchants on their trek around the bogs, a brave innkeeper named Teth Aslody built the establishment and named it after his deceased wife. Under no circumstances did he know it was sitting on one of the most lucrative and rare resources the world has ever seen—until Teth lost everything.</p><p>One day while cooking a meal for some adventures his kitchen caught on fire. In a fright the old innkeeper and his guests collected water from the swamp in an effort to put out the blaze, but in their haste they had inadvertently scooped up what was to be called “black gold” instead. When Teth tried to put out the flames with the contents of the bucket he was thrown clear into the muck from the resulting explosion. Horrified, the adventures tried frantically to quell the flames but Teth`s beloved inn was too far gone.</p><p>The wizard of the group had a very keen eye and noted that when anyone emptied the blackened sludge water over the flames, the fire grew larger rather than diminish. When the mage told the party his observations they were able to control the flames before they extended into the whole swamp, but the tavern was devastated and the old man forced to rebuild it. Feeling somewhat guilt-ridden that it was their meal that caused the inferno, the group offered to escort the innkeeper to the nearest city. They all became fast friends and after a night at a campfire discussion, the adventurers found out that the old man was once a rich merchant and this was the second time he had lost almost everything and needed to rebuild. Teth kept some amount of his fortune hidden away for a time of need, however, and the money would be more than enough to rebuild his life once again.</p><p>This time the innkeeper had devised a plan after reading the wizard’s account of the explosion—the savvy old man knew that this black sludge would one day make him rich. Indebted of his new companions’ actions at trying to save his inn (and succeeding at saving his life), he offered to go into business with the adventurs. Old man Asoldy made the party promise that everything would be shared amongst them all equally, and together, they founded a small merchant consortium and extracted a modest amount of the sludgy black substance which he named “black gold.” Teth Asoldy passed away 5 years later and the business was tossed into anarchy as the adventures jockeyed for a bigger share of the profitable resource. Suffering from the brutal infighting and left severely weakened, when young Iramar Asold arrived to take over his uncle’s estate, Teth’s nephew saw that the groups was severely hampering the progress of the Black Gold Consortium, so he invited foreign merchant families to invest in it. Soon there were numerous elite traders flocking to become part of the venture and the other owners began to sell their shares. After they sold all their shares Iramar decided to call the new group of merchant families the Black Gold Consortium.</p><p>The founding of the Black Gold Consortium led to many changes to the area around the former inn; people flocked when offers to work for the Consortium spread and the settlement blossomed into a town, then a city as more and more settlers from different lands came to the area. New technologies based around the black sludge were invented, such as the gas lamps that light the city at night. Specially designed swamp boats with large rotating paddles and a shallow draft were developed to aid in the logistics required to transport more and more black gold. Ultimately over the course of 150 years, the cultures of the original colonizers have become distinct and unique, leaving behind archaic and useless traditions in favor of a way of life better suited to the Vast Swamp.</p><h2>Cherrian’s Rest (settlement statblock)</h2><p>Neutral small city</p><p><strong>Modifiers Crime</strong> +0, <strong>Economy</strong> +2, <strong>Law</strong> -2, <strong>Lore</strong> +0, <strong>Society</strong> +4</p><p><strong>Qualities:</strong> Insular, Notorious, Prosperous, Strategic Location</p><p><strong>Danger:</strong> 15</p><p><strong>Government:</strong> Council</p><p><strong>Population:</strong> 5,700</p><p><strong>Notable NPCs: </strong>Iramar Aslody, Head of the Black Gold Consortium (LN Male human [Klavek] expert 5)</p><p><strong>Base Value</strong> 6,827 gp; <strong>Purchase Limit</strong> 56,250 gp; <strong>Spellcasting</strong> 6th</p><p><strong>Minor Items</strong> 4d4; <strong>Medium Items</strong> 3d4; <strong>Major Items</strong> 1d6</p></div>","markdown":""},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}}],"flags":{"cf":{"id":null},"core":{"sourceId":"Compendium.Aventyr-Campaign-Setting.aventyr-campaign.g4odaMsHbRkeNFhn"},"scene-packer":{"hash":"ccb29663a8b0242b7eccd7154fdd1a2f61234e86"}},"_stats":{"systemId":"dnd5e","systemVersion":"2.1.4","coreVersion":"10.291","createdTime":1664097018913,"modifiedTime":1675795621820,"lastModifiedBy":"EsIYTtNnjwxUbKOG"},"_id":"g4odaMsHbRkeNFhn","ownership":{"default":0,"R5IsvMTH5P79pBoG":3},"folder":"j9cXBagzZ1ARsO2I","sort":1100000},{"name":"Vikmordere","pages":[{"name":"Vikmordere","type":"text","_id":"U0BsD4hsNZmyzTxq","title":{"show":false,"level":1},"image":{},"text":{"format":1,"content":"<div class=\"aventyr\">\n<p class=\"s5\">Vikmordere</p>\n<img style=\"display:block;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto\" src=\"modules/aaw-games-aventyr/Setting-images/Vikmordere-map.webp\" width=\"443\" height=\"470\" />\n<p> </p>\n<img style=\"float:right;margin:0px 10px 10px 0px;border:0px\" src=\"modules/aaw-games-aventyr/Setting-images/Vikmordere-Resounding-Bodhran.png\" width=\"198\" height=\"400\" />\n<p>The word Vikmordere can be used either to describe the region in which the barbarian people live or the people themselves.

The oldest texts of the Klavek Kingdom recall a massive settlement of Vikmordere that encompassed not only the Eastern Mountain region, but the plains beyond into what is now the Klavek Kingdom. It is unknown how the Vikmordere were reduced in number, but their populace was diminished and they withdrew to higher elevations. They sought refuge in the frigid snow covered eastern mountains.

The summit of most peaks is packed with snow and ancient glaciers, a cold unforgiving wilderness where few creatures can survive. The lower peaks are covered in pine trees which dot their way down sharp slopes and over rugged hills up to the edge of the @UUID[JournalEntry.ismpCNWpGHvB1iPw.JournalEntryPage.Erya8w29cRTTJELu]{Serpent Lake}.</p>\n<p>Serpent Lake and the Vikmordere Valley contain most of the flora and fauna of the region. The lake’s edge makes for the perfect Vikmordere gathering place for camping and telling stories while feasting. When in danger, the Vikmordere take to the mountains and disappear into inhospitable lands where few can follow, let alone survive.</p>\n<p>The @UUID[.U0BsD4hsNZmyzTxq#boreal-forest]{Boreal Forest} stretches along the southernmost parts of the Serpent Lake and consists of a mix of spruce, pines, birch, larches and tranteum trees.</p>\n<h1>Boreal Forest</h1>\n<h2>Weather</h2>\n<p>The winters in this part of the world, with average temperatures below freezing, last six to eight months. Temperatures vary from −54 °C to 30 °C (-65 °F to 86 °F) throughout the whole year. The summers, while short, are generally warm. In large parts of this region, -20 °C would be a typical winter day temperature and 18 °C an average summer day. Snow may remain on the ground for as long as nine months.</p>\n<p>Precipitation is low; rain does fall during the short summer, but mostly it’s snow and fog, the latter coming from the thawing of the frozen Serpent Lake starting in late spring. Due to the fog, sunshine is not abundant in the boreal forest of the region, even during the long summer days, but there is enough moisture to sustain a dense forest growth.</p>\n<h2>Flora</h2>\n<p>The forest along the southern parts of the @UUID[JournalEntry.ismpCNWpGHvB1iPw.JournalEntryPage.Erya8w29cRTTJELu]{Serpent Lake} consists of a mix of spruce, pines, birch, larches and @UUID[.U0BsD4hsNZmyzTxq#tranteum-tree]{tranteum trees}.</p>\n<p>Due to the cold, the soil is thin and poor in nutrients. Fallen leaves and moss can remain on the forest floor for a long time in the cool, moist climate, which limits their organic contribution to the soil. Acids from evergreen needles further leach the soil, sometimes creating areas that are almost sandy and excessively drained. In other parts of the region, only lichens join the moss. In forest clearings, herbs, berries, shrubs and wildflowers can be found, among them the infamous @UUID[.U0BsD4hsNZmyzTxq#stinkberries]{Stinkberry bushes} and the dangerous Calathgar. Twisted Treants are known to have clearings as their favorite spots in this area, and act as gardening guardians, occasionally gaining the powers of a druid to complement their natural abilities.</p>\n<p>In the northern parts of the region, the closed canopied forest gives way to a more widely spaced lichen woodland, with diminished foliage on the windward side.</p>\n<p>Periodic wildfires with return times of about 50 years clear out the tree canopies, allowing sunlight to invigorate new growth on the forest floor. For some species, wildfires are a necessary part of the life cycle in the taiga; some have cones which only open to release their seed after a fire, dispersing their seeds onto the newly cleared ground.</p>\n<h3>Tranteum Tree</h3>\n<p>The tranteum tree, an evergreen, is endemic in this part of the world, its wood much sought of by elves who like to use it for bows with an especially long range. A masterwork bow out of its wood and built by an elven master has its range increment heightened by 10′. Because the sun is low in the horizon for most of the year, it is difficult for plants to generate energy from photosynthesis. Tantreum trees do not lose their leaves seasonally and are able to photosynthesize with their older leaves in late winter and spring when light is good but temperatures are still too low for new growth to commence. The ground freezes during the winter months and plant roots are unable to absorb water, so the Tantreum tree has found a unique way to store warm water beneath its bark. If released by needy creatures, the warm water is enough for one medium humanoid for a day and also heals two points of nonlethal damage from cold, but the Tantreum tree will wither and die as a result. Elven druids of the Northlands are known to get very angry should this happen.</p>\n<h3>Stinkberries</h3>\n<p>Stinkberries, which can be found in forest clearings, emit an acidic smell even before plucked, but more so once removed from the thorny twigs of the infamous Stinkberry bushes. They can be crushed easily and the resulting tar-like substance pasted on the skin, which lowers Charisma-based skill checks by 2 versus creatures with a sense of smell. They also turn the skin slightly paler. The first two days of wearing Stinkberry paste the wearer is nauseated also, then she gets used to the smell. Orcs and @UUID[JournalEntry.QlctNkzE9injOde9.JournalEntryPage.7AP9WRRk8pR9xpgU]{Half-Orc} are immune against this nauseating side effect for unknown reasons. The upside of the Stinkberries is that they drive away insects of all kinds, which is a blessing in the summer months, and also drives away dweomercats and ahlinni. Nonetheless, the usage of stinkberry paste is forbidden in the villages @UUID[JournalEntry.QVrlu0lTv2vFtT5P.JournalEntryPage.EMzVKZQWrG8a60Xj#drakkal]{Drak’kal} and @UUID[JournalEntry.QVrlu0lTv2vFtT5P.JournalEntryPage.EMzVKZQWrG8a60Xj#sunglor]{Sunglor}, but not in @UUID[JournalEntry.QVrlu0lTv2vFtT5P.JournalEntryPage.EMzVKZQWrG8a60Xj#torrent]{Torrent}, which regularly leads to lots of comments among the @UUID[JournalEntry.QlctNkzE9injOde9.JournalEntryPage.DXD1ygEckY0JIUFB]{Human (Klavekian)} from those three villages. The contents of an average stinkberry bush is enough to paste two medium humans. The effects last for seven days.</p>\n<h2>Fauna</h2>\n<p>The cold winters and short summers make the taiga a challenging habitat for reptiles and amphibians, which depend on environmental conditions to regulate their body temperatures, and there are only a few species in this part of the world. Some hibernate underground in winter.</p>\n<p>The @UUID[.U0BsD4hsNZmyzTxq#boreal-forest]{boreal forest} is home to a number of large herbivorous mammals, such as moose, reindeers, elks and caribous. There is also a range of rodent species including beavers, squirrels and some species of hares. Some larger mammals, such as bears, eat heartily during the summer in order to gain weight, and then go into hibernation during the winter. Other animals have adapted layers of fur or feathers to insulate them from the cold.</p>\n<p>The biggest herbivores in the region are the mammoth, the mastodon, the woolly rhino and its even bigger cousin, the elasmotherium. Unlike to the nearby plains, where they roam in vast herds, the forest contains but singles or families of those large animals.</p>\n<p>Predators like owls, eagles, foxes and weasels feed on rodents and are themselves sometimes hunted by the bigger predators. Those include the great cats like the lynx, snow leopards, cave lions, smilodons and white tigers and also by the wolverines, including their bearlike dire wolverine cousins. The wolves are a close second among the most variant hunters, ranging from normal wolves and terror wolves up to the dreaded dire wolves and winter wolves. Notable is also another great cat, the unique and stealthy missing lynx, the forest drake and the many-colored Ahlinni, a flightless predatory bird.</p>\n<p>Omnivores like bears, dire bears (cavebears) and raccoons are present also.</p>\n<p>Insects have also carved their niche in the northern forest, and not only the swarms of flying pests that fill the summer airs. Monstrous insects in the north are the feared white-and-silver, cold generating gelid beetles, which come in small and large variants, the giant tarantula spider and the dreaded weaverworm, which many sages count under Aberrations also.</p>\n<p>Rumors speak of a green dragon in the forest, or a white one in variants, and also a few linnorms, but if such large predators are indeed living in the regions no one has survived an encounter with them yet. No rumor are the large taiga giants who roam the forest to hunt the megafauna.</p>\n<h2>Fey</h2>\n<p>Surprisingly Fey are rare in the boreal forest at the @UUID[JournalEntry.ismpCNWpGHvB1iPw.JournalEntryPage.Erya8w29cRTTJELu]{Serpent Lake}, with the Mimi the sole exception. Sage speculate that they were driven out by their brethren in the @UUID[JournalEntry.ismpCNWpGHvB1iPw.JournalEntryPage.zUmf61j380tilNZt]{Dark Wood} further north, but why this may have happened, if at all, nobody knows or talks about. The Mimi are gathered in tribes of up to 80 fey and could be a big force in such numbers if they ever chose to.</p>\n<p>A few Kitsune families are known to live in the forest, but they give the Mimi tribes a wide berth.</p>\n<p>Some people count the dweomercats as well as the fey wolverines as faeries. While the fey wolverine is more undisputed in this category and even has a fitting name, the dweomercat is a creature of the first world. How it got to the Klavekian lands at all is the stuff of many discussions.</p>\n<p>Another creature of dubious origin is the smoke haunt who attacks woodcutters and others emerging from their campfire. A local tale, sung by the skalds of the three villages at the Serpent Tail River, tell a story linking it to the fey, but if this is fictitious or based on facts is up to discussion.</p>\n<h1>Government</h1>\n<p> </p>\n<img style=\"display:block;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto\" src=\"modules/aaw-games-aventyr/Setting-images/sm-Serpent_Lake_Region-Grid-768x960.webp\" width=\"447\" height=\"773\" />\n<p> </p>\n<img style=\"float:right;margin:0px 10px 10px 0px;border:0px\" src=\"modules/aaw-games-aventyr/Setting-images/Vikmordere-Warrior-Wizard-Marak-the-Raven-480x584.webp\" width=\"257\" height=\"313\" />\n<p>The Vikmordere are loosely organized in groups or tribal clans of 50 or more per encampment.

These people now collectively make up what the Vikmordere call the “@UUID[Compendium.Aventyr-Campaign-Setting.aventyr-campaign.dOJJ8mRNTPtoihmF.JournalEntryPage.l22xqVPei8b2u04P]{Ancestor Spirit}” which drives everything they do.</p>\n<p>As legend has it, the Ancestor People lived in this world long ago and used amazing magic to travel the entire world and shape it as they saw fit. They made the mountains, the rivers, the forests, and the streams and then they began to build cities. Over many generations, the Ancestor People lost touch with Nature and the world they created, instead opting to live in cities and laying waste to the gifts their ancestors forged for them.</p>\n<p>Finally, a wise man came from the south who had not forgotten the ways of their people. He saved the Ancestor People from plagues and famines and taught them to hunt and gather in the forests and live free in the world. Within just a few generations, the people had returned to their former life. At this time a pledge was made with Mother Nature to always protect and respect her ways and to join her spirit force when one dies. Thus the Ancestor Spirit began to grow and evolve; now it is strong and the wild world lives again. The Vikmordere will never lose their way in the world and will fight to stay free and destroy the “city people” and their evil ways.</p>\n<h1>Religion</h1>\n<p> </p>\n<img style=\"float:right;margin:0px 10px 10px 0px;border:0px\" src=\"modules/aaw-games-aventyr/Setting-images/Vikmordere-Spirit-Stones-480x579.png\" width=\"228\" height=\"276\" />\n<p>@UUID[JournalEntry.dOJJ8mRNTPtoihmF.JournalEntryPage.l22xqVPei8b2u04P]{The Ancestor Spirit} guides all of the Vikmordere people and asks them to respect the land, mountains, trees, animals, and plants of the world.</p>\n<p>Totem poles are carefully crafted by woodworkers under the guidance of the Tribal Shamans and raised to give praise to the animals of the wilderness for their gifts to the world.

Most gold retained by the Vikmordere comes from raids in @UUID[JournalEntry.QVrlu0lTv2vFtT5P]{Klavekian} land.

They then return to their ships with the spoils and finish off the last section of the river which eases them into the ocean. Using the natural currents, the ships are pulled back into an inlet which leads to underground cavernous waterways. From this point the Vikmordere use a tribal secret that only the tribal elders that navigate the ships are allowed to see. Leading a crew of rowing Vikmordere men, the elders summon the @UUID[JournalEntry.dOJJ8mRNTPtoihmF.JournalEntryPage.l22xqVPei8b2u04P]{Ancestor Spirit} to show them the way to the Ancestral Gateway – a powerful permanent portal deep in the water-filled caverns. Once located, the ships are pulled into a large cave. This cavern is full of ancient ruins, within which rests a magical portal abutting a large stone archway.

The rugged island hosts a mix of black spruce and white pine, while birches, poplars and willows display beautiful fall colors starting in early autumn. Evenings are made memorable by breathtaking sunsets, whilst on clear nights there always is the likelihood of a appearance of the northern lights. The northern part of Crow’s Rest Island is bounded by spectacular red granite cliffs and coves that give the appearance of being magical and are mostly unexplored by humans as of now. They are inhabited by kobolds, but that may not always have been the case, since there are far older ruins on the island. The kobolds don’t look favorably on other humanoids rummaging around there and to prove this point, they leave shrunken heads and spread-eagled skeletons pinned to the cliffs. But even if they somehow could be avoided, there are also grim repositories of long-undead creatures and worse, if tales can be believed. Like so often in the North, what looks like a stunning paradise at first glance is actually only hiding its dangers behind mirages.</p>\n<p>The western sector of the island is flat, while almost mountainous relief is characteristic of the eastern part and accounts for about 70 per cent of the total area. Although absolute heights are low, the hills have steep, dissected slopes where only the sparsest vegetation and the hardiest goats manage to eek out survival.</p>\n<h2>Fauna</h2>\n<p>Secluded bays provide some of @UUID[JournalEntry.ismpCNWpGHvB1iPw.JournalEntryPage.Erya8w29cRTTJELu]{Serpent Lake} most important waterfowl habitats, and, to the delight of every fisherman with the courage to brave the dangers of the sea serpents, they teem with lake trout and northern pike. While golden and bald eagles abound, Crow’s Rest Island is known for its migratory bird life, aside from the name-giving crows, there are ducks, geese and loons as fellow summer visitors.</p>\n<p>Terrestrial mammals are mainly linked with the forest: brown bear, wolves, foxes, sable, and red squirrels have crossed the ice in especially cold winters and made a home on the island. Foxes are ubiquitous, and without the crows, it would in all likelihood have been known as the ‘island of foxes’ long ago. Such abundance of this species has provoked rumors of Kitsune living here too, either impersonating most of the foxes or at least living among them in hiding. The existence of pond drinkers may be a clue toward this, but it is unproven nonetheless.</p>\n<p>Perhaps the most distinguishing feature of Crow’s Rest Island is the abundance of sea mammals which form beach colonies in the west. In addition to the sea lion and common seal, widespread in the Serpent Lake, there are colonies of two rare species, the six-legged Zantula (see below) and the giant sea otter. Crow’s Rest Island lies on one of the major migration routes of birds nesting in the North. More than two dozen bird species are known to pass and rest here in times. Marine birds and crows are particularly common and form extensive colonies on the coastal cliffs in the north and the forest respectively.</p>\n<p>The coastlines of the Crow’s Rest Island are plagued by almost all the creatures that are common to the Klavekian Lakeside, so you can see the details in that part. Further inland, forest creatures prevail, but since there is no megafauna on the island, the predators tend to be smaller here compared to the mainland. There’s no reason for adventurers to relax, though, for the predators like the wolves are known to hunt in packs and the kobolds are numerous and cunning. Some of the scaly humanoids have dire rat mounts, and there is at least one sorcerer, maybe an ice kobold, known to be on the island. There also are more undead than one would think, and they are not only inside the ancient ruins. Among these undead, the cadavers have to be mentioned, for it seems to be very difficult to lay them to eternal rest. The kobolds usually avoid cadavers and the even more dangerous cadaver lords for this reason.</p>\n<p>The six-legged, vermin-like pond drinkers are rare around the Serpent Lake, but they are more common on Crow’s Rest Island. These blood drinkers are rumored to have banished the fey from the island, with the possible exception of the kitsune, and are now plaguing the kobolds and sometimes fishermen coming to close to the coastline.</p>\n<p>With its ability to prepare itself for long, cold winters by consuming huge quantities of aquatic insects, snails, small fish and fish eggs, and to survive for up to six months under several meters of ice if need be, the Zantula is well adapted to the Serpent Lake’s northern parts and likely to be found along shorelines and in shallower bays there. That it is so abundant this far south has made sages speculate if Crow’s Rest Island’s northern coves may be the long sought-after breeding ground for the strange mammals. Zantulas have an oily pelt which is surprisingly warm and gives a +2 on saving throws versus non-lethal cold damage. The oil vanishes three months after the harvesting though, and sooner if it is washed regularly. After two months, the pelt starts to stink, making its wearer and everyone downwind and closer than 20 feet distance nauseated as long as the pelt can be smelled. This can attract reefclaws, who are not above eating the occasional carcass, and the smell an old zantula pelt emits indeed reminds of a very old carcass.</p>\n<p>Sometimes known as the Vikmordere fish, because of its very large, brightly-spotted dorsal fin that reminds of a vikmordere sail, the alisfish is one of the most distinctive and attractive fish in northern waters. It is vividly colored, with an iridescent light purplish-blue back, and white sides. It also lives in the warmer parts of southern Klavekian rivers, but grows to trophy size in the cold, clear waters of Serpent Lake, reaching record weights of over four pounds, and super-lengths of 30 inches. Close study by fishermen of the alisfish’s habits has revealed that large specimen gravitate to deeper waters, with smaller fish inhabiting medium depths. Zantulas, seadrakes and tentamorts alike hunt the Alisfish, so it is very dangerous to compete with the latter monsters, but a small bay on the northern side of Crow’s Rest Island is known to be a location were it is easy to harvest Alisfish, if one survives the competition. It is very easy to bait the normally shy zantulas with alisfish to harvest their pelts (see above).</p>\n<h2>Flora</h2>\n<p>The coastline of Crow’s Rest Island is characterized by deep, clear waters and a shoreline dominated by mosses, lichens and low-growing shrubs. Further inland, black spruce, white pine and birches grow with the aforementioned spectacular colors in fall. On the western side, horsetails, sedges, wetlands filled with willows, and banks lined with mixed balsam poplar and spruce woods also provide ideal breeding habitats for ducks.</p>\n<p>Crow’s Rest Island is not known for its biological strangeness ,as most of the plants found here are common in the rest of the Klavekian realm.</p>\n<p>One exception for this is the elven berry, a highly nutritious, orange-colored fruit from the Klavekian willow, which is indigenous to the eastern shore of the southern @UUID[JournalEntry.ismpCNWpGHvB1iPw.JournalEntryPage.Erya8w29cRTTJELu]{Serpent Lake} and some of its islands. Despite being a little berry, the elven berry is considered by some to be one of the more useful foods found in the Klavekian realm today. It is a fruit having a short post-harvest period, after which it tends to deteriorate. That is why elven berry is available only as juice fruit pulp outside the North. This juice and pulp are used in numerous local beverages for its spicy taste, but a successful Craft (Alchemy) check DC 20 can produce a product that is able to enhance the normal eyesight for 20 feet for 2d6 rounds. Low-light or darkvision are not enhanced by the elven berry. The enhancing quality is the reason for the name of the berry, though a human still can’t compete with elven eyesight, however much elven berry beverage he has consumed.</p>\n<p>Another berry that bears mentioning here does it for warning purposes only. The saliberry is a blue fleshfruit with many seeds inside and has the size of an average sword pommel. Like the elven berry, it grows mainly on the southeastern part of Serpent Lake and some islands. Saliberries are thought by some to be a highly effective weight loss food, although no magic evidence exists to prove this statement. Indeed sages claim that consuming a certain amount of fresh saliberries causes the delusion of an immediate loss of weight, obviously some illusionary defense mechanism of the berry versus its natural enemies. The delusion lasts for about eight hours and can be disbelieved as usual. Victims of saliberries who want to believe in the fruits do get no saving throws, more sceptically minded eaters have to succeed a will saving throw DC 5. This is a mind-affecting (compulsion) effect. Saliberries have a bitter taste and are sometimes served with bloodhawkwings to complement the flavor.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n</div>","markdown":""},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"sort":0,"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}}],"flags":{"scene-packer":{"hash":"f4a22b344d6e36f05e7bf33382c00df35bfb095f","sourceId":"JournalEntry.Cg0Nt8mDPQ7JrmyB"},"cf":{"id":null},"core":{"sourceId":"Compendium.Aventyr-Campaign-Setting.aventyr-campaign.Cg0Nt8mDPQ7JrmyB"}},"_stats":{"systemId":"dnd5e","systemVersion":"2.1.4","coreVersion":"10.291","createdTime":1663427672675,"modifiedTime":1675797603086,"lastModifiedBy":"EsIYTtNnjwxUbKOG"},"_id":"Cg0Nt8mDPQ7JrmyB","ownership":{"default":0,"R5IsvMTH5P79pBoG":3},"folder":"j9cXBagzZ1ARsO2I","sort":400000},{"name":"Yerek Steppes","pages":[{"sort":100000,"name":"Yerek Steppes","type":"text","_id":"9qnqPShRDAbXxvDG","title":{"show":false,"level":1},"image":{},"text":{"format":1,"content":"<div class=\"aventyr\">\n<p class=\"s5\">Yerek Steppes</p>\n<img style=\"display:block;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto\" src=\"modules/aaw-games-aventyr/Setting-images/Yerek-Steppes-map.webp\" width=\"381\" height=\"574\" />\n<p>The Yerek Steppes are home to the Yerek people, a semi-nomadic group that moves north, closer to the @UUID[JournalEntry.b1DKjyyIAffVIzX1]{Scorched Lands}, in the winter and the southern border of the the steppes, near the sea, in the summer.

Nicknames are discouraged, as these are seen as an insult to the names that are thought to be given to by child’s mother by Musta’vohi herself.

Boys are girls are considered adults when they can make the journey without help from any other members of the tribe. Until that point, all children are raised in Purus-thal under the watchful eye of the Mothers of the tribe.</p>\n<p>Upon returning from their first journey, the newly anointed adults are the guests of honor at a large feast in Purus-thal. Once the feast is finished, both the boys and girls are sent on their final test to prove adulthood. With no weapons and only a small sack with a little food and what the child deems necessary, they are sent into the wilds of the steppes. Their objective is to return with enough meat to replace what the feast has consumed or more, if possible. They have one week to complete this task.</p>\n<p>As the children are taught to make knives from flint and stone, the most successful return from their hunt bearing meat and skins and carrying knives made with handles from the antlers of the deer of the northern steppes or more formidable weapons made from the antlers of the elk and moose that live in the southern grasslands.</p>\n<p>Those that return with nothing or very little are relegated back to the status of child and are required to make the walk again before they take part in the hunt.</p>\n<p>Occasionally, a child does not return at all. In these cases, there is a twenty-four hour vigil held by the adults of the tribe. They are mourned and an offering of food and gifts are given to the parents, who are relieved of any tribal duties for one week.</p>\n<p>Other than the walk, the most recognized part of Yerek society is that the women of the tribe, down to the smallest infant girl, is considered a divine gift from Musta’Vohi. While men and women work side by side as equals, any serious decisions are made by the eldest female in attendance. If there is no female of age to have children present, the eldest male will make decisions.</p>\n<p>This does not mean that women in the tribe are treated as royalty. The opposite, in fact. They work just as hard as their male counterparts in all aspects of life. This is because the Yerek figured out long ago that everyone needed to work together if their people were to survive.</p>\n<p>Yerek children are taught survival skills at a young age. They learn things like how to hunt, farm, and live off of the land as well as how to make various weapons.</p>\n<p>Ariun Uudor is celebrated during the first week of each month. A single day of the week is set aside for a festive celebration honoring Musta’Vohi. Songs are sung and tales are told. Thanks are given for blessed unions and healthy children, while those who have had less than beautiful marriages still offer her supplication, so that they may have another chance to find love.</p>\n<p>Every male Yerek must also learn the gazar. These are capering dances performed while the dinner meal of Ariun Uudor is being prepared. Everyone changes their clothing into a bright, colorful outfit which is designed to present liveliness against the coming darkness. During the gazar, the women of the tribe sing the duu, songs of praise to Musta’Vohi, thanking her for their continued prosperity and to pray for easy, painless pregnancies, and healthy children.</p>\n<h2>Physical Characteristics</h2>\n<p>The Yerek people are, on average, short and stocky, looking like tall Dwarves to some. Occasionally, dweorg are found in Purus-thal as they travel from one place to another, which adds to the confusion. The Dwarves and the Yerek share many similarities in both attitude and outlook. While the Yerek are not a pessimistic people, the overwhelming attitude is “what will be, will be.”</p>\n<p>Both men and women of the Yerek stand approximately 5 feet tall, with slight various between 4’10” and 5’3″. Never in recorded Yerek history has there been anyone over 5’6″. The men usually weigh between 150 and 175 pound with the women being only slightly lighter.</p>\n<p>The men generally keep their hair short, usually, while the women usually wear theirs long although the opposite is seen as well . Hair is almost uniformly black, although very dark brown is not uncommon. Younger Yerek, especially those making their first walk, tend to have lighter hair due to sun exposure. Some women dye their hair with the juices of fruits, such as the anar for red or the ners for blue.</p>\n<p>Brown eyes are the most common color. Dark blue and dark green eyes make up about ¼ of the Yerek population, while lighter colors are almost nonexistent.</p>\n<h2>Farming</h2>\n<p>On the walk from end to end of the steppes, a large variety of ox called an uhker (oo-ker) is used to carry belongings. In general, these oxen are well-behaved, but do not tolerate cruelty for very long. Standing just over five feet tall at the shoulder, almost eight feet long, and weighing close to a full ton, these animals are respected by their drivers. Those that try to bully an uhker are often left in a bloody heap with broken bones.</p>\n<p>The uhker are also used in the western steppes near the border with the @UUID[JournalEntry.g4odaMsHbRkeNFhn]{Vast Swamp}. It is here that the Yerek grow crops to supplement their meat- and wheat-heavy diet. Uhker break apart the thick, heavy mud that make up the fields and their dung is used as fertilizer. In this area, wheat as well as thin-skinned peppers and a root vegetable called khunsni grow.</p>\n<p>The khunsni grows deep in the waterlogged soil while leaves float a few inches above on the waters surface. It can be eaten raw or chopped up and used in soup. It is sweet and crunchy when raw and adds a nutty flavor to soups.</p>\n<p>The pepper, called chinju, are bright green or red and spicy, but not overwhelming. They are also used in soups and for giving flavor to a variety of dried meats. Chinju can also be dried for storage and later use.</p>\n<p>Those that tend the fields tend to carry scythes or sickles, but clerics who help with the harvest use spiked chains altered to have small cutting blades. This allows them to harvest, but also to praise @UUID[JournalEntry.dOJJ8mRNTPtoihmF.JournalEntryPage.2wbAulHSDXQk55Q8]{Musta’Vohi} while using her favored weapon.</p>\n<h2>Technology</h2>\n<p>Given the spiciness of the chinju, the Yerek have found a way to use it as a deterrent to animals and the occasional person.</p>\n<p>The bladder of a dead uhker is taken and treated to keep the material supple. The juices and seeds of the chinju are ground up and dried. This is mixed together with water from the farmland in the west and then placed inside the bladder.</p>\n<p>A leaf from the khunsni is placed over the mouth of the bladder and has small holes poked through it.</p>\n<p>To use this device, called a shursh, the bladder is placed on the ground and stomped on or is smashed between the hands. The mixture of water and dried pepper is forced through the holes in the leaf, creating a mist that envelops a 10 foot cone in front of the bladder. The mist causing irritation to the eyes and sinuses, effectively blinding the opponent.</p>\n<p>Because walking the length of a country is hard on the feet, the Yerek needed some way to protect their feet on the journey. To do so, they have used the stomachs of uhker for adults or stomachs of small animals for children. They are filled with a thin later of a water and wheat dust mixture, making the water more viscous, and the stomach is sealed. The stomachs are then placed into the shoes to make walking more comfortable, as the syrupy fluid shifts back and forth with each step. A permanent mending spell is applied to these stomachs, preventing them from wearing out.</p>\n<h2>Magic</h2>\n<p>Arcane magic is virtually absent from the Yerek Steppes, but divine magic is present. This ability is generally found in the druids and rangers who look after the fields of the western steppes as they attempt to prevent wheat sickness from reappearing.</p>\n<p>Clerics follow @UUID[JournalEntry.dOJJ8mRNTPtoihmF.JournalEntryPage.2wbAulHSDXQk55Q8]{Musta’Vohi}and their role depends on how they decide to worship. If they are trained to be healers, they can be found either in the western swamps or in Purus-thal to aid with childbirth. Protectors journey with the tribesmen who walk the land.</p>\n<p>During Ariun Uudor, the clerics of that use Musta’Vohi’s ability to influence others to attempt to bring unmarried tribe members together.</p>\n<p> </p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"aventyr\">\n<h2>Significant Characters</h2>\n<p> </p>\n<h3>Grandmother Theilda</h3>\n<p>(NE, Female Yerek (human), Adept 10) – Barely sixty years old, but her body has been worn down by the constant migration of her people.

These grasslands begin in the north, near the @UUID[Compendium.Aventyr-Campaign-Setting.aventyr-campaign.b1DKjyyIAffVIzX1]{Scorched Lands} with a hardy grass that has evolved to combat the heat that is generated when the Shard of the Sun passes overhead. This grass is called kuchtei, which means “strong” in Yerek. The kuchtei extends approximately five miles from the Scorched Lands border.</p><p>As the land descends from the north the grasses become more temperate, with longer stalks. During the day, as the Shard of the Sun approaches in its orbit and after it passes by, a strong, hot wind blows hard through the kuchtei and into what is known as the sahlsdeg, or wavy grass. The motion of the grasses in the wind are mesmerizing to watch, especially as the heat from the passing Shard causes ripples in the air above the grass. This effect occurs within a couple of miles from the kuchtei. There is no mechanical effect in the game due to this phenomena, but the Yerek will sometimes pause in their walking and face the hot wind, allowing it to blow over them.</p><p>The center of the country is the most agriculturally diverse, with @UUID[.eOVkEXkbiSWbkVcp#treeland]{Treeland} to the east and waters from the @UUID[Compendium.Aventyr-Campaign-Setting.aventyr-campaign.g4odaMsHbRkeNFhn]{Vast Swamp} to the west providing opportunity to irrigate the land. Almost directly in the middle of the Steppes is Purus-thal, home of the Grandmother and any Mothers than can no longer make the trek from north to south and back.</p><p>The center of Purus-thal is the ger, a type of portable tent, that was carried by Tani, the First Grandmother. When she could no longer make the journey, she set up her tent, proclaiming it to be Purus-thal. Since that time, each Grandmother adds her own ger to the area surround the dwellings of the previous Mothers and Grandmothers. There are more structures than people who live in Purus-thal, which the Yerek are willing to rent out to travelers. The young women of the tribe who are due to give birth will stay in Purus-thal on their next passing and will inhabit Tani’s ger during the birthing process.</p><p>All babies born to the Yerek are raised in Purus-thal by a collaborative of all birth mothers, the Mothers, and the Grandmother</p><p>To the west, where the Steppes meet the Vast Swamp, is where most of the agriculture in the Yerek Steppes originates. This area is always overseen by a shaman or a nature oriented cleric so that any recurrence of wheat sickness can be determined quickly.</p><p>To the northeast of the country, where Treeland begins to recede but before the land dries up at the Scorched Lands, there is a surprising number of fruit trees, including fig and an intensely aromatic species of lime tree that the Yerek call “idemkhii.” The entire area has a strong scent of idemkhii and lavender, which dots this fragrant landscape in clusters of small shrubs. There are other fruit trees, grasses, and herbs in this area, but the idemkhii and lavender are the most prevalent.</p><h2>Treeland</h2><p>The eastern edge of the Yerek Steppes is known as Treeland.</p><p></p><p><strong>Flag:</strong> None</p><p><strong>Loyalty:</strong> Treeland</p><p><strong>Alignment:</strong> Chaotic Neutral</p><p><strong>Export:</strong> Fruit</p><p><strong>Import:</strong> None</p><p><strong>Assets:</strong> Unknown</p><p><strong>Population:</strong> Approximately five hundred thousand (88.5% primates (non-human), 10% other animals, .5% human)</p><p><strong>Authority Figure:</strong> @UUID[Compendium.Aventyr-Campaign-Setting.aventyr-campaign.dOJJ8mRNTPtoihmF.JournalEntryPage.jjNtg5QMfe2uI6uS]{Qathindli}</p><p></p><p>Treeland was founded roughly one hundred fifty years ago by Qathindli, demigoddess of monkeys. It is ostensibly a part of the Yerek Steppes, but Qathindli has claimed it for the monkeys. The Yerek have a small population that has more than enough land, so they haven’t disputed Qathindli’s claim.</p><p>Treeland has very little history to speak of, being a young country and no one seeing any point of invading a small forest.</p><p>With just over one million square miles of land, almost entire covered in trees and shrubs, Treeland has plentiful fruits, most of which are eaten by the primate dwellers. The rest are given to the Yerek as a peace offering. The Yerek think that one fruit in particular, the forhoral, is a potent aphrodisiac.</p><p>The few humans that live in Treeland stay on the western edge of the forest. Qathindli has granted them a small parcel of land which they are using to grow vegetables to trade with Qathindli in exchange for living in the forest. At first, the humans were surprised to be visited by a talking monkey the size of a child’s doll, but they soon took her small form to be cute and almost irrelevant until she began arriving in their part of Treeland accompanied by several gorillas.</p><p></p></div>","markdown":""},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}}],"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"Compendium.Aventyr-Campaign-Setting.aventyr-campaign.NncIDs7ugdrg07c0"},"scene-packer":{"hash":"a48004fe1801e312558b5d4a99fb7c4c84f871db"}},"_stats":{"systemId":"dnd5e","systemVersion":"2.1.4","coreVersion":"10.291","createdTime":1665770125724,"modifiedTime":1675798215257,"lastModifiedBy":"EsIYTtNnjwxUbKOG"},"ownership":{"default":0,"R5IsvMTH5P79pBoG":3},"folder":"j9cXBagzZ1ARsO2I","sort":300000,"_id":"dHHrcptCELfN05gb"}],"scenes":[{"_id":"auGbDTZt0IVlKNRt","name":"Aventyr

Most frequently this is during war, where neither the unhelpful morality of good and evil nor the confusion and disorder of chaos allow for clear decisions to be made and victory achieved. The Axiomatic General appears wherever clear-thinking, considered tactics, and balanced plans are being prepared or followed. While the field of war is the usual site for these activities, the Axiomatic General has been known to appear during complicated but emotionless court cases, and sometimes even when the cold, detached clarity of true monkish enlightenment is reached.</p>\n<p>The Axiomatic General is neither male nor female, instead being a creature devoid of physically distracting bias. It can appear as a female or male of any humanoid species, whichever form is most likely to aid with clarity of decision making.</p>\n<h2>Dogma</h2>\n<p>The Axiomatic General and its followers wish to bring the clarity of law to those places that currently live in emotional turmoil and to demonstrate to all the axiomatic nature of law when applied to war, legal frameworks, and personal actions. It expects its believers to instigate and adhere to meaningful laws while at the same time exposing and amending those which are ludicrous, outlandish, convoluted, unenforceable, or contrary. The Overseer of War abhors any decision or process that allows an individual to take unfair advantage of another, either through methods such as emotional blackmail, the abuse of personal power, or as a result of chance. It encourages its followers to engage in long-term ordered “wars” rather than short-and-sharp fights—the chaos of battle is well known, but by carefully considering one’s options, testing one’s theories, and then following through with a well-conceived plan, one can make their way to victory in an ordered manner. If all around them are clear about their intentions, one can see their actions are as fair and just as possible, and that trade and public prosperity, the courts, and the growth of society as a whole can continue during even the greatest of conflicts.</p>\n<p>The Lord of All Wars promotes careful consideration in all matters and expects its followers to be able to provide self-evident truths for all their actions. Haste, guesswork, and self-indulgence lead to reliance on emotion and base, uncontrolled actions. It disapproves of reliance on government or any religious institution that fosters blind trust or, even worse, unprovable belief, explaining that those with sound judgement, mental discipline, and an unshakeable grasp of sensible, irrefutable laws can overcome the inauthentic evidence and invalid arguments of the emotional and chaotic masses.</p>\n<h2>History</h2>\n<p>Once a mortal humanoid, the Axiomatic General ascended to become deified, although it is unclear what exactly it once was as virtually all races have a legendary historical figure that has risen from the mortal ranks to those of the divine after following the path of a great warrior who tirelessly supported its deity. What is evident is that the Overseer of War became more powerful than this original deity and ended up judging it at the culmination of a long conflict. The Lord of All War’s final verdict and victory provided the energy and evidence needed for the warrior to rise to godhood itself.</p>\n<p>The Axiomatic General tends to appear in history (as the simple warrior of its humanoid type) when the race’s pre-eminent lawful deity first wages war against more than one non-lawful foe, whether they be good, evil, or chaotic. It goes by many titles (a few of which appear above) but always has the ability to make clear, concise, and entirely accurate decisions even in the heat and fog of combat. Tales invariably tell of the Overseer of War having to uphold the lawful aims and ambitions of another deity’s followers when the god or goddess itself proves to be weak and fallible. Then the Axiomatic General steps in to save those same worshipers before judging the god in question and finding it wanting. After this, it takes the fight to the enemy, turns the tide of the war with unquestionable judgement, and becomes a deity in its own right. After this, the Lord of All Wars is always found leading those who know its words to be the truth through conflict, disagreement, and dispute—a reliable route to absolute, undeniable victory.</p>\n<h2>Relationships</h2>\n<p>The Overseer of War is entirely dismissive of any and all other deities that do not in some part embrace lawful beliefs. While those that promote chaos feel its full wrath, the Axiomatic General constantly seeks to disprove the tenets of neutral good and neutral evil deities because of their reliance on sentimental or self-centred emotions. It tolerates lawful good and lawful evil gods as long as their lawful nature is at the forefront of their actions, and is just as likely to support a lawfully-minded archon in a conflict against an evil devil as it is a lawfully-minded devil that wages war against an overly-good archon; ultimately, the balance of law is what is important.</p>\n<p>The Axiomatic General is opposed by all those who promote personal choice, uncontrolled actions, and “belief”—it is guaranteed to come into conflict with deities that support and nurture bards and barbarians, and frequently with those that nurture wild sorcerers. Because it is so closely linked with conclusive and categorical truth, the Lord of All Wars sometimes finds itself on the side of sages, experts, philosophers and academics that devote their lives to uncovering a lost or hidden truth, whether military, legal, commercial, or magical.</p>\n<h2>Appearance</h2>\n<p>The Axiomatic General usually appears as a healthy, vibrant member of the appropriate race and can be either female or male (or neither). Its clothing is always practical for the situation but is clearly designed to instil confidence and invariably a bright white. The god’s symbol, the decorated iron rod, is sewn into the space above the heart and mimicked by the weapon it wields. The Overseer of War always carries a +3 axiomatic brilliant energy light mace, the look and effect of which are in line with the main domain of the senior cleric in the vicinity as follows:</p>\n<table style=\"float:left;width:99.5833%;height:113px\" border=\"1\">\n<tbody>\n<tr style=\"height:32.5px\">\n<td style=\"width:47.7664%;height:32.5px;background-color:#000000;border-color:#ffffff\">\n<h3><span style=\"color:#ffffff\"><strong>Domain</strong></span></h3>\n</td>\n<td style=\"width:52.2358%;height:32.5px;background-color:#000000;border-color:#ffffff\">\n<h3><span style=\"color:#ffffff\"><strong>Rod type</strong></span></h3>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height:20.125px\">\n<td style=\"width:47.7664%;height:20.125px;background-color:#ecf0f1;border-color:#000000\">Law</td>\n<td style=\"width:52.2358%;height:20.125px;background-color:#ecf0f1;border-color:#000000\">Alertness</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height:20.125px\">\n<td style=\"width:47.7664%;height:20.125px;background-color:#ecf0f1;border-color:#000000\">Nobility</td>\n<td style=\"width:52.2358%;height:20.125px;background-color:#ecf0f1;border-color:#000000\">Splendour</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height:20.125px\">\n<td style=\"width:47.7664%;height:20.125px;background-color:#ecf0f1;border-color:#000000\">Strength</td>\n<td style=\"width:52.2358%;height:20.125px;background-color:#ecf0f1;border-color:#000000\">Flailing</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height:20.125px\">\n<td style=\"width:47.7664%;height:20.125px;background-color:#ecf0f1;border-color:#000000\">War</td>\n<td style=\"width:52.2358%;height:20.125px;background-color:#ecf0f1;border-color:#000000\">Rulership</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>Legends dictate that the Axiomatic General occasionally appears as a fully advanced, adamantine-coated marut, but the last occasion this was recorded was many generations ago.</p>\n<h2>Providence</h2>\n<p>Followers and clergy of the Lord of All Wars know that clarity of planning, deeper understanding of the way forward, or insight into a problem that has been gained after careful thought and consideration has come from their deity. This knowledge doesn’t appear suddenly but is the reward for taking time and exploring all possibilities. The Oversee of War thinks highly of those who consider their options before acting decisively, as well as of those who follow through with long-term plans without faltering.</p>\n<p>Any sign of plans failing, the confusion reigning, or participants not understanding their role is seen as a sign that the Axiomatic General is displeased and expects greater discipline and forethought.</p>\n<h2>Servants</h2>\n<p>The Axiomatic General rewards those who organize well and keep to agreed plans, no matter how long this may take. These machinations often take many generations in the case of shorter-lived humanoids such as goblinoids and humans, or the entire life of the longest-living elves. Servants must be prepared to sacrifice the immediate for the longer term, understand that they may lose those around them today for the betterment of a lawful population tomorrow, and recognize that the needs of a lawful future outweigh any considerations here and now.</p>\n<p>The Overseer of War grants particular favour to those who constantly uphold the law—inevitables are viewed with esteem alongside formians and other hive-minded creatures. Followers that devote themselves to a lifetime of achieving a long-term lawful aim regularly receive insight and clarity from their god. Humanoids that either spend a significant portion of their time gaining greater insight into a particular path or are able to rapidly judge the features and benefits of a number of possibilities before quickly making the correct decision often gain a divine hint or two.</p>\n<h2>The Church of the Axiomatic General</h2>\n<p>Sites of worship to the Lord of All Wars serve one purpose: to ensure that correct decision are made to further indisputable truth. They range in size from an officer’s table in their tent, a simple sand tablet on which a cleric explains a truth, or in a lawyer’s or sage’s rooms, to the chambers of a country’s most magnificent courtroom, the order flags at the front line of the latest battle in a war, or the grandest library within the @UUID[JournalEntry.QVrlu0lTv2vFtT5P]{Klavek Kingdom} most spectacular cathedral to the Axiomatic General. Churches to this god are all simple, plain affairs that remove mental distraction and clutter at the same time as allowing axioms and tenets spoken by the Overseer of War to be spread effectively and efficiently.</p>\n<p>Worship of the Axiomatic General is frequently silent as followers consider practical issues at hand as well as long-term problems that require a more considered solution. Followers frequently engage in debates, most of which are serious but enjoyable affairs—there is no time for frivolous thought when the Lord of All War’s tenets are involved—although there is no sense of “victory or defeat” in these sessions (the aim is to reach the truest, most accurate solution to a question, and everybody learns something.) When necessary, churches of the Overseer of War provide a neutral meeting point between warring factions of good and evil, although only the most experienced and senior of clergy attempt to mediate between chaotic elements. The Axiomatic General has shown that the wisest course for followers of law is to work together to overcome chaos through any means possible before resolving philosophical and personal lawful differences using contemplation and debate.</p>\n<p>The clergy of the Overseer of War organize themselves in a clear and obvious hierarchy in the same way that any modern military, business, or courtroom would do. Similarly, religious and educational centres that follow the Axiomatic General have a plain structure in place that shows who has best demonstrated an understanding of the god’s aims and objectives. No matter where or how the Lord of All War is followed, its churches are defined by their grasp of unequivocal truths, unimpeachable laws, unbeatable tactics, and unquestionable enlightenment. Churches that exhibit knowledge over belief and can demonstrate undeniable evidence for these truths have the greatest standing, no matter what their size. Worshipers rise up the ranks in the same way: anyone who can establish irrefutable knowledge and information is given ever greater responsibilities. At the same time, mistakes aren’t considered a failure if the individuals concerned can show they did all they could to establish clarity and a considered answer. All they have to do is recognize that further investigation has produced better knowledge and make sure they don’t repeat the mistake. As the Lord of All Wars is happy to develop plans over many generations, errors that can be rectified bear little consequence.</p>\n<p>Churches worshipping the Axiomatic General are openly found in the centre of lawful societies and on the outskirts of those populations with no preference for law or chaos but are seemingly absent from chaotic cultures. The Overseer of War prefers his followers to surround such cultures and gradually move inwards until the chaos is crushed out of them—a process that takes as long as is necessary, designed to ensure no worshiper is tricked into joining chaos from within.</p>\n<p>Services to the Axiomatic General are ordered affairs, comprising either contemplation of the truth or respectful presentation of findings and subsequent decision-making they influence. In all situations, there is ample opportunity for everyone who wants to speak to do so, although followers recognize the need to act swiftly during war situations and develop a truncated, precise style of presenting their findings.</p>\n<h2>Worshipers</h2>\n<p>The Axiomatic General is primarily worshipped by military officers but also draws in judges, lawyers, barristers, sages, monks, and those who would advance society in an ordered and structured way. Those who indulge in chaotic thoughts and acts are ignored at all times.</p>\n<h2>Clergy</h2>\n<p>The clergy of the Overseer of War are not necessarily clerics, although if they aren’t they are only allowed to represent the god within their own sphere of expertise and influence (for example, military officers can only lead services and discussions about military matters). Any member of the clergy who is a cleric is required to lead a service in an overarching capacity even if the content is decided by the senior subject expert. In all situations, the most experience cleric leads a service, with assistance as appropriate from other members of the congregation.</p>\n<p>The Axiomatic General does not support paladins, despite their martial outlook. Their tendency towards good leads them to not always consider the balanced needs of a lawful life, which in turn means their judgment isn’t always going to be the best it can be in some situations.</p>\n<h2>Temples and Shrines</h2>\n<p>Buildings devoted to the Lord of All Wars are functional, unadorned, designed to serve all aspects of the god’s tenets, yet clearly focused on one domain more than others (whatever that may be). It isn’t unusual for there to be four temples next to each other—one for each aspect of devotion with followers visiting whichever is most appropriate for their needs.</p>\n<p>All sites of worship have one item in common: a magical lead box with an amazing lock that holds a copy of the four holy texts of the Axiomatic General (The Four Planes of Certain Truth) plus one additional book of specific thoughts on the area of expertise of the congregation. These boxes are identical as adornment or elaboration is forbidden as an unnecessary distraction, and are always at the centre of any service of worship or decision-making process. Whenever the box is locked after its final use for the day, the text within each book is updated via divine intervention if a more accurate and truthful version of any piece of information has been discovered and when new facts have been uncovered.</p>\n<p>Each place of worship also contains the thought processes of anyone who has worked to uncover indisputable truths, as well as the evidence that demonstrates that truth. Whenever someone is uncovering a new truth, their work-in-progress materials are stored here as well.</p>\n<h2>Holy Texts</h2>\n<p>The Four Planes of Certain Truth contain the pertinent and unequivocal statements confirmed by the Axiomatic General. When stored in their magical box they are updated via divine intervention when it is locked at the end of the day. No decision is made without this box being present, even if it isn’t used. Clerics of the Overseer of War receive notification of changes as part of their meditation; all clerics and service leaders are encouraged to learn the texts by heart (as interpretation isn’t required).</p>\n<p>Each book bears a simple cover, binding, and little decoration other than an iron rod over a stylized letter that identifies its contents. Other documents stored at temples and shrines have these two symbols plus the initials of the author and the date of publication. When any document is superseded, the date of its relegation from cannon is stamped on the cover and the original symbols are scored through.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h3><em><strong>Axioms of War</strong></em></h3>\n<p>This contains the latest approved plans for war as a whole, as well as tactics for individual fights. The core content—when consulted prior to a battle—confers both a confidence-boosting and calming effect as it confirms how its actions bring eventual victory in the war (with that day’s battle an important part of it). Chapters detail the stages of engagement and explain the surest way forward at each point. They describe how a lawful plan can be overcome by the sheer weight of chaos, but also how to learn from that experience and counter it in the next battle.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<h3><em><strong>Axioms of Law</strong></em></h3>\n<p>This contains the latest approved plans for passing legal judgment as a whole, as well as tactics for individual cases. When consulted prior to establishing guilt or innocence, it confers both a clarity- and authority-boosting effect as it confirms how its actions ensure the correct judgment is reached. Chapters detail the stages of ascertaining the truth from all that has been presented as evidence as well as methods to consider it in an effective, efficient, and impartial manner. They also describe how well-made laws can be twisted and broken by the inherently devious, and how to rewrite those laws to ensure this doesn’t happen in future.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<h3><em><strong>Axioms of Decisions</strong></em></h3>\n<p>This contains the latest methods and directions for effective and efficient meditation as well as long-established research techniques from the church’s greatest sages and experts. When consulted before an investigation is started, it confers a mind-clearing and attention-focusing effect as it confirms how its actions allow a user to reveal the most pertinent and accurate information. Chapters detail how to consider what needs to be discovered, how to ensure what is found matches the initial requirements, and then how to use the information to make the correct decision. They also describe how distraction, obfuscation, and distortion of aims and objects (such as shortcuts) lead to an incorrect decision with long-term consequences.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<h3><em><strong>Axioms of Enlightenment</strong></em></h3>\n<p>This contains pathways to understanding the world at large and the part one plays in that world as well as how the best of life is achieved through the order. When consulted before meditating, it confers an open-mindedness that ensures the route to enlightenment is properly followed as it confirms how its actions allow a user to reach self-knowledge without deviation or distraction. Chapters give details on what to do before, during, and after meditation, as well as how to realize enlightenment has been reached. They also describe how our contemplation can be lessened by the actions of others, but how these digressions can be overcome and enlightenment eventually reached.</p>\n<h2>Holidays</h2>\n<p>The Axiomatic General is not celebrated at any specific festivals. Instead, when the law prevails during any of the god’s areas of interest, followers offer a prayer of thanks no more than 30 minutes after the event. If gratitude is shown later than this, it probably means the follower was distracted from the task at hand and has acted in a chaotic way to make the thanks fit in. Better to acknowledge the effect of the Overseer of War with one’s body and mind than take yourself away from a pressing matter and make two situations chaotic.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n</div>","markdown":""},"_id":"OB8fp8gIre5yoZax","image":{},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"sort":400000,"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"JournalEntry.0FSVjV3WkdoAk7OX.JournalEntryPage.K8IEnGHHZ3800Nio"}}},{"name":"Ancestor Spirit","type":"text","title":{"show":false,"level":1},"text":{"format":1,"content":"<div class=\"aventyr\">\n<p class=\"s5\">Ancestor Spirit</p>\n<img style=\"margin:0px 10px 10px 0px;border:0px;float:right\" src=\"modules/aaw-games-aventyr/Deities-Images/waterfall_edit-scaled.webp\" width=\"244\" height=\"698\" />\n<p><strong>Titles: </strong>Breath of Life, Life Spirit</p>\n<p><strong>Home: </strong>Positive energy plane</p>\n<p><strong>Alignment: </strong>NG</p>\n<p><strong>Portfolio: </strong>Ancestor, nature, wilderness, wisdom</p>\n<p><strong>Worshippers:</strong> @UUID[JournalEntry.QlctNkzE9injOde9.JournalEntryPage.I4CpK8rTs0HgD7hW]{Vikmordere}</p>\n<p><strong>Domains: </strong>Animal, Community, Plant</p>\n<p><strong>Subdomains: </strong>Ancestors, Seasons, Souls</p>\n<p><strong>Favored Weapon: </strong>Wooden staff</p>\n<p>The Ancestor Spirit venerates reconnection with nature, and exploration of one’s inner being without the scourge of individual financial gain.</p>\n<p>    The pure energy which forms this deity is comprised of the souls of the original ancient settlers of the @UUID[JournalEntry.QVrlu0lTv2vFtT5P]{Klavek Kingdom}/@UUID[JournalEntry.Cg0Nt8mDPQ7JrmyB]{Vikmordere}.

He was dissatisfied; dwarves had become a lesser race, overcome by the @UUID[JournalEntry.QlctNkzE9injOde9.JournalEntryPage.8HyVcZ70eyhwNJsu]{Drow}, among others. His life was punctuated by constant struggle and heroic feats that are the things of legend: he re-mastered the lost arts of metalworking once known by his ancestors; he defended his homeland single-handedly against creatures of the Underworld, and he built himself a flawless suit of unbreakable armour. Inside this shell, he was an unstoppable force, and Balir took back thousands of miles of once-dwarven lands. He rose higher than any before making the fatal flaw of offering his hand in peace to the drow.</p>\n<p>The story goes that the Drow cast a curse of burning into his unbreakable armour, sealing the dwarf inside and setting it ablaze forever. But at this moment the gods saw Balir as the greatest martyr of his people and granted him a spark of divinity; he awoke as a god, still within the armour that had become his tomb, and departed the mortal realm.</p>\n<p>Having risen from the ranks of mortals, Balir has been forced to prove himself to the gods over and over again, showing them he is worthy. His feats as a god are no less than his feats as a mortal, although they take place in realms far beyond man’s comprehension. It is from one of these divine toils that he claimed his mighty hammer, Soul Forger – a weapon clearly claimed from a creature many times larger than Balir himself.</p>\n<p>Even as he found himself a god, Balir kept his destroyed mortal form as a sign of his penance. Instead of divine flesh, he constructed a metal body for himself to replace the one he lost. This new skin is without the flaw of mercy that destroyed him as a mortal. And although Balir’s scarred face is unmistakably dwarven, his body is anything but. A cast of white mithral and black iron, he appears more machine than man. Now, even with his drow-cursed armour destroyed, he still blazes with the murderous fire; in his chest, he carries a spark from which the sun was born. When he does not appear in his divine form, Balir assumes the guise of a young dwarf, typically bearing scars on his face and arms from flame.</p>\n<h2>Churches, Clergy, and Worshippers</h2>\n<p>Churches to Balir are at once humble and magnificent. Their areas of worship are simple and unadorned, although always practical, in a manner befitting dwarven life itself. Whether the smallest shrine or grandest cathedral, sites dedicated to Balir always stand near a place of work, toil, and creation. In them, they are guided by Balir’s ancient knowledge and secrets to produce machines, mechanical goods, and works of active art unlike anywhere else in the world. Balir’s clergy are predominantly dwarven, although some humans do acclaim his faith as well. Where they can, they dress in mithral and crimson – styling themselves after their god. Poorer members of the faith dress instead in white and yellow. Worshippers almost always offer constructed items as their offering. If they do resort to just money, it’s always directed toward a newly-qualified crafter or a promising apprentice.</p>\n<h2>Holy Text</h2>\n<p>The Life of Balir is unlike any standard book of holy teachings. Instead, this tome is almost three thousand pages long and details the thousand trials and tribulations of Balir’s life, written in such a way that it is more like a dwarven self-help book than divine instruction. Some versions have additional volumes discussing the merits of each action Balir took, although these are known to be opinions, not facts. The original text is unchanged from when it was penned by Balir’s own son, after the dwarf’s ascension to godhood.</p>\n</div>","markdown":""},"_id":"SjKuUjzrx9TNLn0y","image":{},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"sort":500000,"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"JournalEntry.EykWA9hRZOjLFz6G.JournalEntryPage.JtgEqWY5XOkGnzgZ"}}},{"name":"The Current","type":"text","title":{"show":false,"level":1},"text":{"format":1,"content":"<div class=\"aventyr\">\n<p class=\"s5\">The Current</p>\n<img style=\"float:right;margin:0px 10px 10px 0px;border:0px\" src=\"modules/aaw-games-aventyr/Deities-Images/The-Current.webp\" width=\"267\" height=\"316\" />\n<p><strong>Alignment:</strong> LN</p>\n<p><strong>Portfolio:</strong> Insanity, Mysticism, Seas, Underworld Waters, the Unknown</p>\n<p><strong>Domains:</strong> Madness (Nightmare), Magic (Arcane), Void (Dark Tapestry), Water (Oceans)</p>\n<p><strong>Favoured Weapon:</strong> Tentacle (whips, spiked chains)</p>\n<p><strong>Favored Animals:</strong> Octopus, Squid</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>History</h2>\n<p>The other deities of Aventyr are forever vigilant for even the slightest brush of the Current’s tentacles in their plans or near their essence, keeping a respectful distance from the maddening god. Its motives are totally unpredictable, though it strikes swiftly and without warning when it is suited to do so. The affairs of the gods don’t seem to bear any interest to the Current, however, and it is thought to be slumbering, like the massive beasts that lay in the ruins of the vestraadi’s ancient civilizations. Indeed, some believe that these enormous predators are somehow related to the maddening god and not without good reason; they appeared not long after the Current came to Aventyr.</p>\n<h2>Appearance</h2>\n<p>Records of The Current’s appearance are extremely vague by necessity; those that look upon it are driven utterly mad. The few reliable accounts claim that it is floating, slithering or pulsating mass of writhing tentacles, the end of each covered in barbs of colours for which there is no shade or name.</p>\n<h2>Churches of the Maddening God</h2>\n<p>These revered houses of worship completely encompass those within them, covered in sculptures of tentacles that extend throughout the structure. The holiest of these churches are actually made from the recovered limbs of enormous squids and octopuses—the architecture within them drives any non-followers of the Current to madness, afflicting any creature within with a form of insanity should they fail a DC 16 Wisdom saving throw.</p>\n<h2>Holy Text</h2>\n<p>No books exist for the religion of the maddening god; instead, the vestraadi keep song strings. When wound or unwound underwater, these magical cords play hymns of the Current’s religion (in a tongue those that hear them can understand). The holiest and most valuable of these song strings are said to relate the true origins of the aquatic deity but are said to drive those that hear them mad with the voice of the Current, cursed to forever live with its echo in their mind.</p>\n<h2>Vast Swamp</h2>\n<p>@UUID[JournalEntry.g4odaMsHbRkeNFhn.JournalEntryPage.oIbJsrbNZu7GVWp9#the-muddy-mangroves]{The Muddy Mangroves} has always been the center of the Current’s clergy in the Vast Swamp.

The others chose their domains carefully, but Eureum took his from necessity. For, there must be balance in life as there must be balance in death.

It is said, that beneath the cowl, he perpetually weeps.</p>\n<p>   When he does not appear in a humanoid form, he appears as a collection of dry autumn leaves blowing in the wind.</p>\n<h2>Church of Eureum</h2>\n<p>Much to his dismay, most of Eureum’s churches are misguided, focusing only on one aspect – either death or rebirth – and are often fanatical in their beliefs.

Her mother, Laelstra, was the Matron’s personal seeress. Hivaka possessed only the slightest of her mother’s magical abilities, mastering cantrips at an early age, but progressing no further. Being the youngest daughter, barely older than her only brother, and her sisters already being groomed for succession to various positions within the House, Hivaka found herself being used as leverage but almost everyone around her.</p>\n<p>    Hivaka’s father, Elkerd, was first son of House Kilduis, allies of House Ruim. Among Elkerd’s vices was gambling—he never minded losing, as long as fun was had by all. The problems began when he started using House Kildius’ assets to cover his wagers. When he was financially cut off from House Kilduis, he took the step of offering his youngest daughter, Hivaka, to the winner of a game of orbben. When Elkerd lost to Imfein of House Rilyntyl, a rival of House Kilduis, Hivaka was taken from her home by force. Laelstra protested, but there were too many reliable witnesses to the wager for her challenges to hold sway over her Matron. Thus, Hivaka was taken into slavery by House Rilyntyl. Laelstra attempted to buy Hivaka from Imfein, but was rebuffed, as having a bargaining chip against House Kilduis’ ally was worth much more than gold.</p>\n<p>     Aside from the hard labour she and many others were forced to endure, Hivaka was treated well—as well as a slave could be treated, anyway. She took her enforced servitude in stride, seeing as how she had almost never held any power of significance in her life. However, she harboured a hatred for her father, not understanding how a parent could blithely hand over their child’s life to another simply to cover a bet.</p>\n<p>     The guards from House Imfein did not treat her any better or any worse than any of the other slaves. Neither did they prohibit her mother from visiting her occasionally during the evening, as long as no escape attempts were made. They did, however, restrain her from braining her father with her work hammer the one and only time he approached her during a shift of breaking up rocks. If not for the guards, Elkerd would have died violently, but possibly not quickly.</p>\n<p>     Hivaka was a slave of House Imfein for almost a full year before Laelstra recruited a large following and put a plan into action that would free Hivak: she and her cohort would attack the Imfein guards at the slave pens during the night and Hivak would escape in the confusion while wearing the battle-dress of a House Imfein sorceress.</p>\n<p>      The assault appeared to be a success as chaos reigned in the slave pens, however, Laelstra had not anticipated two things: first, there were more guards than anticipated, causing longer holdups and more casualties as the attacking mob progressed. More guards also meant that an alarm could be sounded, bringing reinforcements, which compounded the existing issues with the rescue.</p>\n<p>    The second issue was that Hivaka had determined that no matter where she was in drow society, she would be enslaved. Either to another house or within her own, where she would be used as a pawn in countless numbers of schemes by her Matron and her own family. As the youngest daughter, she held the lowest standing. Because of this, she was determined not to return to her home.</p>\n<p>    Once in possession of the Imfein battle dress, Hivaka pulled the attached hood over her head and began leading slaves away, using her implied authority, along with some well-placed and spectacular-looking cantrips, to move them without interference. She had nearly one hundred slaves with her when they left the Xdot border.</p>\n<p>   Leading them on through the night, Hivaka found a narrow cave entrance that led into a larger cavern inside. Using the last of her available magicks, Hivaka attempted to cover the mouth of the cave with an illusion showing solid rock. The image was far more effective than Hivak knew because she and her group had attracted the attention of @UUID[.2MMXPI4kINBOYNOP]{Leacim}, the only known male drow deity.</p>\n<p>     A trickster among the more serious drow goddesses, @UUID[.2MMXPI4kINBOYNOP]{Leacim} took this opportunity to thumb his nose at his sisters and to have fun, watching as the drow patrols searched the area over and over, never seeing past his illusions.</p>\n<p>     The rescued slaves began worshipping Hivaka as a saviour. She resisted their praise, saying that she was simply another slave, like them. Leacim—knowing that these slaves needed someone to look up to, invested a small amount of his power in Hivaka, raising her above the mortals, but not so high as the divine: he made her a demigoddess.</p>\n<p>     Those under her protection turned their new home into a town, called Nhlilolin, which has become a haven for the outcasts of the Underworld.</p>\n<h2>Appearance</h2>\n<p>Hivaka is short, for a drow, but heavily muscled from her time as a slave. Her light grey hair is kept short for a drow female, the ends reaching her jawline. Her eyes are blue, relatively rare in the Underworld, and if you look into them, you will find nothing but steely resolve.</p>\n<p>   Hivaka keeps her clothes simple, preferring pants and shirts that have pockets. The more pockets, the better. She is never anywhere without the hammer that she used to break the chains of the other slaves before leading them off into the night. Every morning or after any combat, she repairs the wooden handle with the mending cantrip.</p>\n<h2>Church of Hivaka</h2>\n<p>Hivaka, as a very recent demigoddess, does not have a church, but those that were rescued from imprisonment literally sing her praises every day. She downplays her role as a saviour or someone to be worshipped. She does have her devoted followers and, thanks to @UUID[.2MMXPI4kINBOYNOP]{Leacim}, she is able to grant them a small number of spells. She has not gained any paladins, though.</p>\n<h2>Worshippers and Clergy</h2>\n<p>Those who escaped with Hivaka are her greatest worshippers, but any who have escaped bondage freely speak her name with reverence. There is no set clergy in Nhilolin, but some apostles go out into the Underworld (and a few to the Upperworld) and speak against slavery, striving to free those that are held down, if only through word if not deed.</p>\n<p>     Some of these preachers will gather the like-minded with them and attempt to free those taken by slavers. These zealots do not care if they live or die, as long as those imprisoned go free.</p>\n<h2>Holy Text</h2>\n<p>The Journey: The only text that Hivaka doesn’t simply shake her head at is The Journey. This collection of parchments is the story of not only Hivaka leading the slaves of House Imfein to freedom, but every person who has escaped from an overlord is welcome to add their story to The Journey. So far, almost three hundred stories have been put into the collection.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>A second “holy text” has begun circulating throughout Nhilolin and the Underworld, speaking of Hivaka in the holiest of languages, greatly exaggerating her abilities, and almost, but not quite, painting her as the goddess who will eventually overthrow the mightiest of slavers, Naraneus herself. Hivaka has tried to explain that the book, The Light of Hivaka and the Way Forward, brings attention to her and the town, which is mentioned by name in the book, and could lead to them all being recaptured. This explanation has failed, so far.</p>\n<p> </p>\n</div>","markdown":""},"_id":"fGrUoxdeUcElXl1w","image":{},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"sort":1000000,"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"JournalEntry.0ZJ73TBS2gtaaHzz.JournalEntryPage.8ICOLekqb9Rv4c6W"}}},{"name":"Ja Qua","type":"text","title":{"show":true,"level":1},"text":{"format":1,"content":"<div class=\"aventyr\">\n<p class=\"s5\">Ja Qua</p>\n<img style=\"float:right;margin:0px 10px 10px 0px;border:0px\" src=\"modules/aaw-games-aventyr/Deities-Images/Ja-Qua.webp\" width=\"263\" height=\"235\" />\n<p><strong>Titles: </strong>Mother, Jaguar Queen, Heart of the Jungle, She Behind the Leaves</p>\n<p><strong>Home: </strong>The Fey Jungle</p>\n<p><strong>Alignment </strong>LN</p>\n<p><strong>Portfolio: </strong>Strength, The Hunt, Family</p>\n<p><strong>Worshippers:</strong> Actively worshipped by many natives of @UUID[JournalEntry.RMK7HBFDlPXDiURg]{NairaCull}</p>\n<p><strong>Domains: </strong>Strength, Animal, Law, Protection</p>\n<p><strong>Subdomains: </strong>Ferocity, Fur, Resolve</p>\n<p><strong>Favoured</strong> <strong>Weapon:</strong> Natural Claws, Maquahuitl</p>\n<p>Considered by a vast majority of the native peoples of NairaCull to be she who controls the balance of life within their lands, the worship of Ja Qua is the dominant faith within the dark nation.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>History</h2>\n<p>Ja Qua herself predates most written language, and her own followers have spent their entire lives passing down the tales told to them from previous generations, leaving her history entirely in the hands of those who revere her. Little is known to her followers of her true origins, only that she has proven to be an active and loyal spiritual force within the lives of those who never looked away from the older forms of worship.</p>\n<p>   Ja Qua exists within a sub-dimension connected to the mainlands of the Seelie Court and has fostered a deep relationship with the fey of her lands, looking upon them with the same love and care as her human followers. In turn, the fey has come to view her as one of their own and a revered person of power amongst their courts, and will not hesitate to interact on her behalf within her lands.</p>\n<h2>Appearance</h2>\n<p>Ja Qua appears in one of two forms when she chooses to appear at all. The first is that of a monstrously large and physically powerful jaguar, golden tawny in colour with spots that appear to shift and move before one’s eyes. Crowned with a rim of bony protrusions across her brow and snout, there is no mistaking Ja Qua in her feline form as the self-appointed Queen of her lands. Her second form is one of far more subtlety, one of an attractive woman, typically still keeping the tawny colour of her pelt within her long hair. The colour of her eyes in human form is said to be indescribable, as no true colour exists within nature to compare them to, and her voice will both seduce and petrify you with fear in the same instant.</p>\n<h2>Church of Ja Qua</h2>\n<p>Ja Qua’s worship is strongest within the lands of @UUID[JournalEntry.RMK7HBFDlPXDiURg]{NaeraCull}, though there is the random shrine amongst a few forgotten uncivilized locations, where the march of progress has not severed all of humanity's connection to the Seelie Court yet.</p>\n<h2>Worshippers and Clergy</h2>\n<p>Those tribal warriors deemed worthy are put through a ritualistic challenge to earn Ja Qua’s Blessing, the gift of lycanthropy. Those who survive the process of transformation, and are not driven mad by the ritualistic pain they must go through to prove their worth find themselves in a position of honour amongst the tribes and temples, utilized as guardians and hunters, protecting both the faith and an ancient way of life. Dressed in only a loincloth these warriors tend to embrace the custom of adorning themselves with colourful trinkets and baubles to mark victories over adversaries, or glorious hunts.</p>\n<p>    Those of great enough faith, but not physical stamina to serve the tribes as warriors tend the temples and altars of Ja Qua as her loyal clerics. Over time those of the deepest devotion begin to acquire certain feline traits, though they never achieve the full embrace of Ja Qua as the temple warriors do.</p>\n<h2>Holy Text</h2>\n<p>Scattered throughout the jungle are many lost ruins of forgotten tribes, within which are wall carvings and bas-reliefs depicting the teachings of various points in the history of the church of Ja Qua. Most of the written language of the people of NairaCull is pictographic and has never been compiled into text or bound format, although it is rumoured that a man travels the jungle seeking to do just that.</p>\n<h2>The Dralman Documents</h2>\n<p>A skald of some renown, Theo Dralman was quested by the Grand University of @UUID[JournalEntry.QVrlu0lTv2vFtT5P.JournalEntryPage.dwAJ5Jtc6ii8zQoh]{Mohkba} to enter the dark jungle and learn all he could of the spirits to which the native people prayed, and how the @UUID[JournalEntry.QVrlu0lTv2vFtT5P]{Klavek Kingdom} could use this information to its own end. That was many years ago, and many of the legends spoken amongst the tribes that have encountered Dralman would lead one to believe that his goals have changed, and his search for knowledge has become something far more personal. Most of the legends speak of a man carrying a great many scars, as if he had been mauled to the edge of death, only to be spared and shown a new path. There exist a few rare copies of his incomplete work, taken to the coastal towns by couriers and those on safari…the Dralman Documents they have become known as. All public possession of these documents within the borders of Klavekian-controlled lands is considered treasonous and punishable by seizure of properties and goods, as well as incarceration.</p>\n<p> </p>\n</div>","markdown":""},"_id":"21VmQoL4MPe6mX6q","image":{},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"sort":1100000,"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"JournalEntry.LQT16PQtjrxETCAe.JournalEntryPage.3JNs1m50QSpNDrdf"}}},{"name":"Leacim","type":"text","title":{"show":false,"level":1},"text":{"format":1,"content":"<div class=\"aventyr\">\n<p class=\"s5\">Leacim</p>\n<img style=\"float:right;margin:0px 10px 10px 0px;border:0px\" src=\"modules/aaw-games-aventyr/Deities-Images/Leacim.webp\" width=\"262\" height=\"371\" />\n<p><strong>Titles: </strong>The Clever Shadow</p>\n<p><strong>Symbol: </strong>Spinning 8-faceted gem</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary)\"><strong style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">Alignment: </strong>CN</span></p>\n<p><strong>Portfolio: </strong>Chance, Guile, Illusion, Misfortune, Self-Determination, Thieves</p>\n<p><strong>Domains: </strong>Chaos, Entropy, Deception, Luck, Trickery</p>\n<p><strong>Favoured</strong> <strong>Weapon:</strong> Scimitar, Shortbow, Throwing Knife</p>\n<p><strong>Favoured Animals:</strong> Any beast with camouflage or mimicry (such as a chameleon, stick bug, etc)</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>History</h2>\n<p>The Aventyr god known as Leacim was once a forgotten deity, supplanted by the doings of the colloid aeons before it ever reached the Underworld. Once a treasured god of cunning and wisdom, he was left bereft in the void of the cosmos—when Leacim stared into the void, something from the far beyond stared back. Now slightly deranged and without an identity, the god capered throughout the universe with a will and desire at the whim of his growing insanity.</p>\n<p>   Eventually, the divine energies wrought on Aventyr during the Forging of the Dvergr caught Leacim’s attention, drawing him to the periphery of the world to witness the rise of the progenitors and their fall into the draaki. It was the elven deities, however, that most interested the god of misfortune—over hundreds of years, he subtly infiltrated their pantheon and species, attributing fanatical devotees in the very flesh before spreading them across both Upper- and Underworld. He appeared inexplicably among the elven pantheon, fully adopting the drow form and gathering followers both before and after their exodus from Edhellond.</p>\n<p>     The most famous of these followers is @UUID[.fGrUoxdeUcElXl1w]{Hivaka} , the Savior of the Masses. Leacim took notice when she and her fellow slaves took flight from Xdot. He imparted the aspiring dark elf with some of his divine essences, forever transforming her into a demigoddess.</p>\n<p>   Leacim continues to take an active (albeit underhanded) role in the continued existence of the drow. He travels through the Underworld, briefly touching the souls of dark elves and morphing their alignments towards chaos, neutrality or even goodness if it suits his mood. The lone raider D’thul, a cannibalistic sorcerer-barbarian in the Fungi Forest near Holoth, is one such drow. Those on the surface often see their lives subtly influenced by the trickster god, and Leacim leads them to roles of dubious natures and unexpected rewards.</p>\n<h2>Special</h2>\n<p>Leacim takes delight in angering the other @UUID[JournalEntry.QlctNkzE9injOde9.JournalEntryPage.8HyVcZ70eyhwNJsu]{Drow} gods at every opportunity; his followers may substitute Leacim as the required diety for any item, class, feat or spell that has a drow deity requirement and may select the Drow domain if they have access to domains. Moreover, he often creates his own agents of change—players that wish to play a drow of good alignment in a place that would otherwise prohibit that choice may choose Leacim as their deity to avoid that caveat.</p>\n<h2>Appearance</h2>\n<p>The trickster god has numerous guises but he most commonly appears as an affably dressed male half-drow with an alluring grin or a blonde human girl, regardless of form, both have piercing blue eyes. Leacim’s clothing is generally fashionable and appropriate for the environment, though it is sometimes slightly tattered and seemingly in a state of disrepair. He casually saunters seemingly without a care in the world, a scimitar on his side and a black-lacquered short bow across his back, in the female form he carries only a single knife as a weapon which always returns to him when thrown.</p>\n<h2>Shrines to the Trickster</h2>\n<p>Leacim doesn’t have proper churches—effigies and the like are hidden in plain sight or are places of secret pilgrimage. These shrines are often made to look like they belong to other deities, and only show their true forms when the correct prayers are uttered. Followers that fail a DC 28 Knowledge (religion) check find their god distempered with them after praying at one of these shrines, though they remain unsure as to why (regardless of any divination spells they cast).</p>\n<h2>Holy Text</h2>\n<p>Leacim’s Lexicon is a treasured tome among thieves’ guilds, hidden drow enclaves and the trickster god’s followers. These books appear as unremarkable journals of unremarkable lives to followers of other deities (DC 26 Wisdom saving throw to negate) but in the hands of a devoted acolyte, provide a means to learn any rogue trick, illusion spell, or access to knowledge of prestige classes that require sneak attack as a prerequisite.</p>\n<h2>The Vast Swamp</h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:Signika, sans-serif\">Leahcim has taken root in the @UUID[JournalEntry.g4odaMsHbRkeNFhn]{Vast Swamp}, his trickster ways helping some daredevil rogues on their quest to lessen the burden of treasure on the vile dragons. It must be added that the tales of the rogues have become known but so far none have surfaced to verify these claims. Recently some inhabitants in the marshes have voiced their concerns—that these rumors are merely planted by Leahcim himself for some unknown reason—but the trickster god has plans and schemes no mere mortal can hope to discern.</span></p>\n</div>","markdown":""},"_id":"2MMXPI4kINBOYNOP","image":{},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"sort":1200000,"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"JournalEntry.fAaBvRaalStVHLAa.JournalEntryPage.CYEQQN8Bs7oSr3YE"}}},{"name":"Musta’Vohi","type":"text","title":{"show":false,"level":1},"text":{"format":1,"content":"<div class=\"aventyr\"><p class=\"s5\">Musta’Vohi</p><p><strong>Titles: </strong>God Mother, Heavenly Concubine</p><p><strong>Homel: </strong>Everywhere</p><p><strong>Symbol: </strong>A goat’s head painted black</p><p><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary)\"><strong style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">Alignment: </strong>NE</span></p><p><strong>Portfolio: </strong>Birth, Health, Motherhood, Lust, Pregnancy</p><p><strong>Domains: </strong>Charm, Darkness, Healing, Protection</p><p><strong>Favoured</strong> <strong>Weapon:</strong> Spiked chain</p><p> </p><h2>History</h2><p>According to the @UUID[JournalEntry.dHHrcptCELfN05gb.JournalEntryPage.Tc1kTiX3bvQt4Jd7]{Yerek}, Musta’Vohi created the universe from the sheer will to reproduce.

This light both warmed the cosmos and struck out against the darkness that also appeared. This light, both protective and aggressive is embodied in Naneth. She is both Leaf Mother and Warrior Mother.</p>\n<p>   Naneth (NAH neth), her sister @UUID[.leuKpASroHy7r6sn]{Naraneus}, and their brother @UUID[.zNH5DtHDKD52Ufaf]{Onael} created the first elves. Naneth comforted and warmed the elves, but she also taught them to defend themselves. She showed them to care for each other and themselves, but they only had each other to rely on. As the elves evolved, she became more of a mothering figure to them, offsetting the chaotic presence of Naraneus, while Onael drifted away from the family.</p>\n<p>    Eventually, Naraneus became jealous of Naneth’s mothering ways and began a feud between the two that would last for ages and eventually encompass the elves as well, two groups choosing a deity to follow. Naraneus lost and the elves that followed her were banished from Edhellond.</p>\n<p>    Once the war was over, Naneth reflected on Naraneus’s deceit. She decided that if she could not trust her own sister, her children couldn’t trust anyone else. She instructed the Matriarch to retreat completely within @UUID[JournalEntry.wVQiwLZtRuaqbpFA]{Edhellond, the Silent Forest}.</p>\n<p>    Trade relations with the other races suddenly ceased and there was no response from envoys sent to the elves. The entire elven society retreated into Edhellond, turning entirely to hunting, agriculture, and magic; forsaking any trade or relations with other races.</p>\n<p>   Naneth taught the elves that they were to rely only on themselves for everything. There would be no trade, no exchanges of information, no envoys allowed inside Edhellond and only those on secret missions benefiting elvish society were allowed to venture out from Edhellond.</p>\n<h2>Appearance</h2>\n<p>Naneth appears in two forms, befitting her dual nature. In her Asaya Naneth (Leaf Mother) form, she appears as a motherly female Elf, with long golden hair that reaches the ground and she always carries a basket of bright blue flowers. In her Maethor Naneth (Warrior Mother) guise, she appears as a tall, stout elf, dressed in leather armour and a small cap keeping her jet black hair out of the way. Regardless of how she dresses, she has a pin of her symbol at the neck of her garment. She always carries a shield that is designed to look like her symbol.</p>\n<p>    She can change between the two forms in the blink of an eye.</p>\n<h2>Church of Naneth</h2>\n<p>Naneth’s “church” is more of an outdoor shrine at the largest maple tree in the Silent Forest, Tal. Edhellond is a theocracy, led by the current Matriarch or Patriarch, who also leads the services to Naneth.</p>\n<h2>Worshippers and Clergy</h2>\n<p>All surface elves worship Naneth in either of her two forms and worship of both is the norm. Clergy outside of the Matriarch/Patriarch and the Cleric of Naneth selected by the ruler are treated equally regardless of power level or ability. The motto of the clergy is “We only have ourselves” so they do not discriminate in any way.</p>\n<h2>Holy Text</h2>\n<p>The Triploid Text: This tome is separated into sections of three, with each section beginning with a parable of Asaya Naneth, ending with a parable of Maethon Naneth, and the middle section being descriptions of the war between the elves and between Naneth and @UUID[.leuKpASroHy7r6sn]{Naraneus}.</p>\n<p>The cover of the copy that belongs to the Matriarch or Patriarch is created from several massive maple leaves.

Its awakening may not have been caused by the pantheon’s doings, but its emergence seems to coincide with The Grand Sculpting and the Great Schism.</p>\n<p>As the endless caves of the Underworld expanded, vast chambers filled with moisture risen from tunnels hundreds of miles away, creating damp caverns of moist earth. The Natural Force seeded the subterranean breezes with its spores, creating the mushroom jungles and fungal forests of Aventyr. More than that, some of these spores carried the very children of the deity—intelligent, benevolent plant humanoids known as @UUID[JournalEntry.QlctNkzE9injOde9.JournalEntryPage.yv3q3b1HnUnZB2OT]{Funglet}.</p>\n<p>The divine beings of Aventyr generally regard the great nature deity of the Underworld with a measure of respect, if they acknowledge it at all. It answers the calls of its followers but is remarkably slow to act openly, playing the great game of the gods with a level of detachment and planning that no other deity can fathom.</p>\n<h2>Appearance</h2>\n<p>When the Natural Force does appear (which is extremely rare), it does so as a @UUID[JournalEntry.QlctNkzE9injOde9.JournalEntryPage.yv3q3b1HnUnZB2OT]{Funglet} of enormous height, colored in a kaleidoscopic mixture of all the different subtypes and carrying a gigantic club made from a fantafungi. Every patch of earth the Natural Force touches erupts with a random assortment of mushrooms immediately after he breaks contact with it, and all naturally grown barriers part their way for it and take no damage from its passing.</p>\n<h2>Church of the Natural Force</h2>\n<p>Any monument or sculpture of a mushroom serves as a shrine to the Natural Force, though acolytes of the nature deity pray to fungus of large size or greater if they are able to. Sites of particular religious significance always bear an importance to the number three, though none are sure why (save the Natural Force and its wisest adherents, though they have never revealed it).</p>\n<h2>Holy Text</h2>\n<p>The Libre Boletus is a tome crafted from boletann pages. Anyone that casually skims the book sees nothing but simple gardening tips to encourage the growth of mushrooms, but should they read it fully through, the pages transform to explain the tenets of the Natural Force’s faith. Carefully absorbing the contents of the tome (requiring 24 hours of reading) teaches the reader the rituals necessary to work and craft boletann.</p>\n<h2>The Vast Swamp</h2>\n<p>The Natural Force is worshiped throughout the Vast Swamp by druids and shamans of the various tribes that inhabit the area. While this mysterious entity has always been worshipped on varying scales throughout history, recently there has been a surge in followers as an unexplained patch of mushrooms not native to the swamp recently flourished in the @UUID[JournalEntry.g4odaMsHbRkeNFhn.JournalEntryPage.oIbJsrbNZu7GVWp9#the-jagged-coast]{The Jagged Coast} area, inexplicably resisting all attempts by @UUID[JournalEntry.g4odaMsHbRkeNFhn.JournalEntryPage.JuqcYkrHQOMobwTy#dreivantix]{Dreivantix} to destroy it. The dragon’s destructive efforts have somewhat lessened as he has discovered the new influx of slaves and food from the pilgrims visiting the site.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n</div>","markdown":""},"_id":"FrD3IGeEnyquVddx","image":{},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"sort":1600000,"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"JournalEntry.JmLtczdTeL3uccIx.JournalEntryPage.Z3OyAXbrDBQZtCkh"}}},{"name":"Naraneus","type":"text","title":{"show":false,"level":1},"text":{"format":1,"content":"<div class=\"aventyr\">\n<p class=\"s5\">Naraneus</p>\n<img style=\"float:right;margin:0px 10px 10px 0px;border:0px\" src=\"modules/aaw-games-aventyr/Deities-Images/Holy-Symbol-Naraneus.webp\" width=\"231\" height=\"245\" />\n<p><strong>Naraneus is a drow-only deity</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Titles: </strong>Queen of Venom; She Who Weaves Darkness</p>\n<p><strong>Home:</strong> The Demiplane of Venom</p>\n<p><strong>Symbol: </strong>A spider with a stylized face on the back or an 8-fingered hand</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary)\"><strong style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">Alignment: </strong>NE</span></p>\n<p><strong>Portfolio: </strong>Darkness, @UUID[JournalEntry.QlctNkzE9injOde9.JournalEntryPage.8HyVcZ70eyhwNJsu]{Drow}, Evil, Forbidden Knowledge, Spiders, Venom</p>\n<p><strong>Domains: </strong>Destruction,@UUID[JournalEntry.QlctNkzE9injOde9.JournalEntryPage.8HyVcZ70eyhwNJsu]{Drow} , Evil, Knowledge</p>\n<p><strong>Favoured</strong> <strong>Weapon:</strong> Scorpion Whip, poisoned</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>History</h2>\n<p>From the beginning, during the Prime Event that created the cosmos, there has been light.

Together, they created the beings that would become knows at elves. @UUID[.oyFVdicDq8mbjOWw]{Naneth} provided the loving and mothering aspect. She showed them how to care for and protect each other, teaching them skills they needed to survive. @UUID[.leuKpASroHy7r6sn]{Naraneus} provided the chaos that seemed to pervade this new world and taught the elves about death and destruction and how to kill for food. Onael provided the controlling aspect, teaching the elves that in order to succeed, in spite of the chaos, there needed to be order and control. He taught them leadership and command and that of all the newly formed races, the elves were the greatest of them all.</p><p>    Eventually, over the millennia, the elves evolved away from the controlled savagery and into the form that is more common today. As the world became more ordered, they needed their aggression less and opened themselves up more to the life and magic that surrounded them. Without as much violence, they began to live longer and grew smaller, as their muscles were not needed as much for combat. They understood that they did not need to conquer and control to live in the modern world and accepted their place, arriving in @UUID[JournalEntry.wVQiwLZtRuaqbpFA]{Edhellond}, the Elven land that would become known as the Silent Forest.</p><p>   Onael did not understand. He thought he had taught them correctly. Seeing that the elves had turned their back on him, he took what he considered his “children,” the Edheliast, and retreated from the world to the Forgotten Forest, a demiplane that he considered his home.</p><p>    In the Forgotten Forest, the Edheliast continue to fight for survival, growing bigger, stronger, faster, and more cunning. They fight against animals, magical beasts, and even the souls of dead elves and drow that Onael claims before @UUID[.oyFVdicDq8mbjOWw]{Naneth} or @UUID[.leuKpASroHy7r6sn]{Naraneus} can.</p><p>    Recently, Onael has begun work to reclaim the elves as his own. He has many Edheliast to fight for him and he has created a new beast that will surely be a surprise to the elves.</p><h2>Appearance</h2><p>Onael appears as an Elf of immense size. He stands close to fifteen feet tall and is very heavily muscled. His dark hair is close cropped and shows off a widow’s peak. He is dressed conservatively, wearing only a black tunic with his symbol on the left breast, black pants, and black boots. On his left hip rest his longsword Coiasan.</p><p> Images of @UUID[.oyFVdicDq8mbjOWw]{Naneth}, @UUID[.leuKpASroHy7r6sn]{Naraneus}, and Onael show that there is a sibling similarity between the three, but Onael claims that he has no sisters.</p><h2>Church</h2><p>There is no church of Onael. There are no services or high priests, only combat. The Edheliant serve Onael by fighting and honing their skills.</p><h2>Worshippers and Clergy</h2><p>Every Edheliant worships Onael in trials by combat. The Edheliant dedicate every battle they participate in to Onael’s glory and ask for him to fill their bodies with power to crush their enemies.</p><p>   There is no church hierarchy. Those that Onael graces with the merest fraction of his power use the spells granted to them to enhance the combat abilities of their comrades and themselves. Onael’s clerics call themselves “Sword Arms” and mostly use spells that increase Strength or Constitution but will also make liberal use of Cure spells and Channeling Energy (if Neutral) to make sure they and their comrades can continue fighting.</p><h2>Holy Text</h2><p>None, although any manual that teaches someone a new fighting technique or improves on an existing technique are considered sacred and are kept in a “library” in the middle of the Forgotten Forest.</p><p> This library is really just many piles of books collected from different planes and realms and every book in the collection deals with some sort of combat.

In the time after the Sun Lord brought the warming of the land, Storjeger led numerous hunts into the forest where they killed many animals. In the bounty that was the land warming, they hadn’t realized that they had over-hunted, leaving the land unbalanced. This led to a lack of game when the land began to cool after the Sun Lord’s death.</p><p>      As the tribe began to dwindle due to lack of food in the harsh winter, Storjeger, as thin as the rest of the tribe, went into the forest alone to find what food he could. After several hours, he spotted a large stag with an impressive rack of horns. Sneaking as close as he dared, his hands trembling from hunger, he threw his javelin. It missed badly, but instead of rushing into the woods, the deer turned and looked at Storjeger.</p><p>    The stag turned and walked slowly into the woods with Storjeger close behind. Following the deer for another hour, Storjeger had been led him to a place in the woods he had never been before. In the distance, he saw a herd of deer that numbered in the dozens with many calves. He prepared his javelin, but the deer he had followed looked at him and then knelt down, laying down its head. It was joined by three does, each kneeling down and offering their necks to Storjeger.</p><p>    Storjeger drew his knife and offering thanks to the deer for their sacrifice, killed the four. He took a few small pieces of meat for himself to sustain him for the trip back. He produced a large sack and bundled the three deer into it and tied the bag to his belt. The stag, he hefted onto his shoulders as a sign of respect.</p><p>     He made the walk back to the Skykosh tribe with tears in his eyes as he knew he could provide for his people. On the trip back, Storjeger realized that his people had to live in balance with the animals of the forest in order to make sure this didn’t happen again. As it was partly his fault that the tribe was in such a predicament, Storjeger was determined to protect the balance of the forest.</p><p>     Upon returning to his tribe, he delivered the deer and explained what had happened and what he had seen and the understanding of the balance. He took the head of the stag and created a mask from it and made a coat from the skin. Without another word, Storjeger walked out of the village and into the realm of the gods, making the name Storjeger synonymous with survival and donning the mantle of God of the Hunt.</p><p>    Storjeger (STOR jay ger) almost always appears as a giant elk but sometimes manifests as a thin warrior of medium height with a stag’s head and horns. He carries several javelin on his back, a longbow made from Yggdrasil, and three arrows, each unique and powerful.</p><p>      Storjeger was originally worshipped only by the @UUID[JournalEntry.QlctNkzE9injOde9.JournalEntryPage.I4CpK8rTs0HgD7hW]{Vikmordere}, but in a very brief period before the @UUID[JournalEntry.QlctNkzE9injOde9.JournalEntryPage.DXD1ygEckY0JIUFB]{Klavekians} went to war with the Vikmordere, there was an exchange of information, including the tale of Storjeger.

More than a physical being, as the insectoids came to dominate the planet of the alien god’s origin, Zagnexis manifested as the congealed consciousness of their dead. While the other intelligent lifeforms on that world fought valiantly, with a deific being directing the racial hive mind of the @UUID[JournalEntry.QlctNkzE9injOde9.JournalEntryPage.SGw7zGFtvjLNPDMY]{hoyrall}, they quickly came to rule over all that the insect god could perceive.</p>\n<p> Until the Great Schism. The progenitors, cast down from their once mythic forms into the lowly race now known as the draaki, made a desperate cry to the cosmos and it was Zagnexis that answered their plea. Mustering the unimaginable power granted from the complete devotion of an entire race of creatures, the insect god transported his entire physical form into Aventyr—Zagn, along with tens of thousands of hoyrall—directly across the universe and into the Dracoprime’s skull, killing the draconic monstrosity instantly.</p>\n<p>    For some generations, Exis continued to direct its children on Aventyr, growing a massive army within the fortress-hives of the hoyrall in preparation for an all-out assault to conquer both the surface and the Underworld. Were it not for the intervention of the colloid during The Confluence, it surely would have succeeded. The other alien entity seized upon Exis conduit to its children, breaking the hive mind of the hoyrall and sending its physical counterpart, Zagn, careening into the oceans of Aventyr to wreck havoc upon everything it meets.</p>\n<p>    Since then, Exis has retained what connections it can to Aventyr, granting powers to its clerics and oracles but little more. The alien god wants nothing more than to expand and procreate, increasing its deific power by generating a second world of followers. Exis is avaricious and without regard for the general balance of natural powers; it will stop at nothing to re-establish its hold over both Zagn and the hoyrall before consuming all of Aventyr.</p>\n<h2>Appearance</h2>\n<p>Exis is a spectral insect composed of dozens of different arthropods, its countless limbs, heads, eyes and antennae constantly morphing into new shapes or variations. Zagn is an enormous, multi-headed (and multi-mouthed) segmented worm with thousands upon thousands of legs that span a body measured by miles.</p>\n<h2>Church of Zagnexis</h2>\n<p>Temples, churches and shrines devoted to the alien god are commonly found throughout the fortress-hives of the hoyrall and honeycombed into Upperworld mountains, but most are in terrible states of disrepair. The unrest following The Confluence led to the dissolution of hoyrall society, and the sites of worship to the god that once bound them all together were quickly targeted by dissenters and never-do-wells. New churches to Zagnexis are well-appointed and carefully kept, tiled with the carapace of insects in exquisite mosaics that depict the journey of the hoyrall.</p>\n<h2>Holy Text</h2>\n<p>There is no written or oral tradition to the worship of Zagnexis; lesser followers are taught the rites of worship through nonverbal communication (through limbs or antennae), and acolytes meld their minds with greater priests in ritual-driven meldings of the minds. Only this devout form of communication is fit for the transmission of the holiest information known to the worshippers of the insect god.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n</div>","markdown":""},"_id":"BgaAYMVXk3L6daU4","image":{},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"sort":2200000,"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"JournalEntry.1nhWSRlTjP4u99gB.JournalEntryPage.vHtchpvGcDlwG7Ja"}}},{"sort":2150000,"name":"Xio","type":"text","_id":"o7Bl7XnxenERvjAq","title":{"show":false,"level":1},"image":{},"text":{"format":1,"content":"<div class=\"aventyr\"><p class=\"s5\">Xio</p><p><strong>Titles:</strong> The Eternal Combatant, Captain of Captains, The Blood Rage</p><p><strong>Home:</strong> Valhalla</p><p><strong>Symbol:</strong> A star crafted from five crossed swords surrounding a bleached skull</p><p><strong>Alignment:</strong> NE</p><p><strong>Portfolio:</strong> Bravery, Combat, War</p><p><strong>Domains:</strong> Destruction, Ferocity, Honor, Strength, War</p><p><strong>Favored Weapon:</strong> Warhammer and handaxe</p><p>Xio is the deity of battle, both honorable and otherwise; he goes wherever there is war or brings it to lands where it is not, ensuring constant and glorious battle.</p><h2>History</h2><p>None truly know when Xio came into existence, but it is said that as long as there has been conflict, he has been amongst those who fight. However the first record of his existence was only a few thousand years ago, after civilization was well established, and people warred amongst one another in vast numbers.</p><h2>Appearance</h2><p>It is said that in Xio one sees oneself, and at least literally this is true. Xio’s true form is unknown, as whenever a mortal sees him he appears as a battle-scarred member of the same race and gender as the observer (though most at least agree that Xio is a male deity).

None rise through the ranks of his church better than those who can wage war, and it’s most common that temples are within fortresses that see constant struggle, or are hastily erected on battlefields. Sites of worship to Xio are rare within towns that are not constantly pressed by conflict—it is said that to erect a shrine to the Eternal Combatant within a peaceful land is to invite war upon it.</p><h2>Worshippers and Clergy</h2><p>Most of Xio’s followers are traveling warriors, mercenaries, and captains of military units. Anyone whose business is war is almost unwillingly bound to the Captain of Captains, and his blessing is known to turn the tide of battle on numerous occasions. His clergy are most often those who begin war, or followers that find peace where it exists and start a violent conflict. Most lands find these warmongers to be no better than bandits (worse than most) resulting in an almost world-spanning bounty for Xio’s clergy—a fact which they relish, meeting each new bounty-hunter with zeal and their god’s greatest blessings.</p><h2>Holy Text</h2><p><em>The Business of War</em><br />Though there are strategic insights to be gleaned from these heavy tomes, the business of war is largely about relishing the glory of battle more than how to conduct it.</p><p> </p></div>","markdown":""},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{"core":{"sheetClass":""}}},{"sort":1250000,"name":"The Mother Spirit","type":"text","_id":"7JZLaCukpLMqn2R2","title":{"show":true,"level":1},"image":{},"text":{"format":1,"content":"<div class=\"aventyr\"><p class=\"s5\">The Mother Spirit</p><p><strong>Titles:</strong> The Great Mother, Leaf Gatherer, Four Heart</p><p><strong>Home:</strong> A nexus of the elemental planes of Air, Earth, Fire and Water</p><p><strong>Alignment:</strong> Neutral Good</p><p><strong>Portfolio:</strong> nature, creation, family</p><p><strong>Worshippers:</strong> @UUID[JournalEntry.QlctNkzE9injOde9.JournalEntryPage.myrc4omqUaiD3RKZ]{Halfling}and fey of @UUID[JournalEntry.PCe82J4UbHQWFYYL]{Picollo}, and those who believe in the Four Winds theory of creation.</p><p><strong>Domains:</strong> Air, Community, Earth, Fire and Water</p><p><strong>Subdomains:</strong> Family, Metal, Wind, Oceans</p><p><strong>Favored Weapon:</strong> Unarmed strike</p><h2>History</h2><p>Worshipers of the Mother Spirit believe that when the elements came together to form the world, a vessel was required to prevent disastrous interaction between opposed elements. The Mother Spirit gathered the elements into her four-chambered heart to allow them to work in community to craft the world.</p><h2>Appearance</h2><p>The Mother Spirit most often appears as a halfling woman with fey or otherworldy features. She wears a homespun brown robe woven with simple leaf patterns. Her hair is that of autumn leaves, tinged with flame. The presence of the other three elements can be found in her ever present tears of alternating joy and sadness, the comforting breath of her voice, and the adamantine sheen of her forearms and hands.</p><h2>Church of The Great Mother</h2><p>Although worshipped primarily in @UUID[JournalEntry.PCe82J4UbHQWFYYL]{Picollo}, knowledge of the Great Mother has been brought to other areas of Aventyr by halflings displaced by the Great Schism, or fey wandering throughout the lands as their whimsy takes them.</p><h2>Worshippers and Clergy</h2><p>Priests usually dress in homespun robes and go about unarmed. Clerics of the Great Mother must select the community domain (or family subdomain) as one of their domains, but may select any of the elemental domains or subdomains as their second. The prestige class, devotee of the Four Hearts, grants access to additional elemental domains.</p><p>Clerics with the separatist archetype can often be found. The Great Mother recognizes that there are many paths to community, and loves these “Fallen Leaves” as much as any other worshipper, hoping they will one day embrace community as a tenet of faith.</p><h3>Fallen Leaf cleric</h3><p>Fallen Leaves are clerics of the Mother Spirit Mastering the divine nature of dual elements requires further study, available only to the Devotee of the Four Hearts.</p><h3>Devotee of the Four Hearts</h3><p>Devotees of the Four Hearts are worshipers of the Mother Spirit who seek to understand more fully the act of creation initiated by the joining of all four of the elements through a deeper examination of the elements themselves. As their understanding increases, they add additional domains to their repertoire of gifts from the goddess.</p><p><strong>Role:</strong> A Devotee of the Four Hearts is more prepared to deal with elemental challenges than her less erudite brothers and sisters. Because the theological study of the elements is deeply intertwined with the nature of the goddess, the scaling of the holy abilities of these priests are less impacted with a diversion into a prestige class.</p><p><strong>Alignment:</strong> Most members of this prestige class tend to be neutral or neutral good to better understand the balance required in bringing together the elements. Lawful clerics embrace the discipline of safeguarding the elements and the world around them while those elements join in community, whereas chaotic priests embrace the messiness of creation.</p><h2>Holy Text: The Tree of Community</h2><p>Temples to the goddess are centered around a great tree which forms the center of the complex, regardless of its architectural style (or design of the grove in cases of a fey temple). The leaves of the tree contain the holy writings of the Mother, as well as the stories of her worshippers, unnumbered as the leaves themselves. Divination and prophetic magic is often tied to, or enhanced by, the tree of community; to read one’s leaf is to gain insight to one’s soul.</p><p></p><p></p></div>","markdown":""},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}},{"sort":1950000,"name":"Qathindli","type":"text","_id":"jjNtg5QMfe2uI6uS","title":{"show":false,"level":1},"image":{},"text":{"format":1,"content":"<div class=\"aventyr\"><p class=\"s5\">Qathindli</p><p><strong>Titles:</strong> The Monkey Primeval, The Unsullied</p><p><strong>Home:</strong> @UUID[JournalEntry.dHHrcptCELfN05gb.JournalEntryPage.eOVkEXkbiSWbkVcp#treeland]{Treeland}</p><p><strong>Alignment:</strong> Chaotic Neutral</p><p><strong>Symbol:</strong> A monkey face with a painted boomerang for a smiling mouth (only used by humans)</p><p><strong>Portfolio:</strong> Nature, Primates, Wilderness</p><p><strong>Worshippers:</strong> Monkeys and disparate or relocated people from the @UUID[JournalEntry.g4odaMsHbRkeNFhn]{Vast Swamp} or the @UUID[JournalEntry.dHHrcptCELfN05gb]{Yerek Steppes}</p><p><strong>Domains:</strong> Animal, Chaos, Plant, Protection</p><p><strong>Favored Weapon:</strong> Boomerang</p><p></p><p>Two hundred years ago, Mentane Flamebearer, a human cleric of a best-forgotten god, and Golar, his half-orc monk bodyguard landed on the eastern shore of what would become @UUID[JournalEntry.dHHrcptCELfN05gb.JournalEntryPage.eOVkEXkbiSWbkVcp#treeland]{Treeland}. The reason for the visit was that Mentane thought he had found a way to become a god. His hypothesis was that if he could instill the magical essences that he acquired daily into the same place for a long period of time, then the release of that pent up energy into himself would push him past the boundary of mortality and into the realm of godhood. Mentane chose a small fuzzy fruit with a green interior, called a forhoral, which grew on a vine as his receptacle of power.</p><p>As they settled on the eastern edge of the forest Golar began to notice the large numbers of primates in the forest. Ignoring them, Mentane had Golar find a piece of wood to allow the vines of the fruit grow upward.</p><p>For the next year, every morning, Mentane would slowly and carefully direct his magical energies into the seed that he had planted. Golar, not being needed, wandered the forest. Some of the primates took interest in the two for a while, but seeing that they were no immediate threat, they were content to ignore the two.</p><p>After about a month, one small chimpanzee began following the Golar as he explored what would become known as Treeland. He began to call her “Qathindli,” which translated roughly to “small one” in his local Orcish dialect. He would call and wave to her every morning and she would chatter back at him.</p><p>Something surprising that Golar noticed was that Qathindli would watch him when he went through his morning exercises. She would sit on a branch and stare at him while he moved in slow, deliberate patterns. She had taken a special liking to his three-bladed boomerang. When she wasn’t watching him practice, he would almost always find her at his pack, holding the throwing weapon. Eventually, he carved her her own two-bladed boomerang and placed a leather strap around the two ends. She took it with her everywhere.</p><p>As the year progressed, Mentane’s fruit began to grow, becoming larger than usual for this type of fruit. The vine grew quickly up the post and one year to the day of its planting, Mentane emerged from his tent, ready to become a god.</p><p>His forhoral fruit was gone. In its place, he found Qathindli sitting on the forest floor, holding the remains of the forhoral fruit.</p><p>She sat and stared, her monkey mind not comprehending what was happening to her.</p><p>Mentane began ranting and raving about the amount of effort he put into the project and his loss to a monkey. In his rage, he was preparing to utterly destroy Qathindli when she turned her head toward him and shocked both he and Golar.</p><p>“What is happening to me?” she asked loudly and haltingly.</p><p>All three stared at each other for a moment before Qathindli screeched and ran off into the forest.</p><p>A few days later, Mentane packed up his belongings and stowed them on the boat. He was going to make his way back to the @UUID[JournalEntry.QVrlu0lTv2vFtT5P]{Klavek Kingdom}. Golar said that he was going to stay in the forest for the time being. They bade each other farewell and Golar watched Mentane sail off into the sunrise.</p><p>Golar found Qathindli her near her tribe of monkeys. She was speaking quickly and erratically, words from every language spilling out of her mouth. Golar understood words from a few languages and recognized several more. The other monkeys were frightened of her.</p><p>Using food, Golar tempted Qathindli out of her tree and through a long and arduous process, explained what Mentane had done with the forhoral fruit and that his best guess was that when she had eaten the fruit, she had absorbed all of the magical power invested in it and that she had become more than a monkey.</p><p>Over the course of the next six months, Golar taught Qathindli control thanks to his martial training. While she did learn how to focus her newly found thoughts, she was still a monkey inside. Her train of thought often derailed into a conglomeration of words from different languages, which made it difficult for Golar to understand.</p><p>The change in her standing among the primates came when, as she and Golar were training in a small clearing, a wild boar broke through the undergrowth and charged at Golar. Though the battle was brief, it was also incredibly violent. In the end, the boar lay dead and Golar had numerous cuts and slashes from the boar’s wicked tusks. Qathindli rushed out from her hiding place and chattered at Golar in numerous languages as he started to succumb to his injuries. As he tumbled to the ground, Qathindli placed her hands on him and with a visible light, poured healing energy into Golar.</p><p>The forest around the two of them went silent as the watchful monkeys around them looked on and saw the power that Qathindli now possessed.</p><p>While she may not have been a demigoddess in the classical sense, Qathindli has eclipsed monkeyhood and is something more. She had decided to be the protector of Treeland, which she named herself. When she accepted that mantle, she became a demigoddess.</p><h2>Appearance</h2><p>Qathindli can change her appearance to that of any primate in existence, except human. Her preferred form is a pygmy monkey that stands roughly six inches tall, with bright red hair. This form seems to cause less violent reactions in those that she speaks with than one of her larger shapes.</p><p>Each of her forms has a face that is like the race she is interacting with than it is monkey-like.</p><h2>Church</h2><p>Even though she doesn’t understand it, the humans that live in @UUID[JournalEntry.dHHrcptCELfN05gb.JournalEntryPage.eOVkEXkbiSWbkVcp#treeland]{Treeland} worship Qathindli. The services are held outside usually around midday, but it varies due to the weather.</p><p>The leader of the humans, Damon, teaches that the people of his tribe should live like the monkeys: in harmony with nature. Because of his worship, Qathindli grants him spells, even if she doesn’t know how she does that.</p><h2>Worshippers &amp; Clergy</h2><p>Qathindi’s worshippers are all of the humans that live in Treeland, under the guidance of her only clergy member, @UUID[JournalEntry.dHHrcptCELfN05gb.JournalEntryPage.Tc1kTiX3bvQt4Jd7#damon]{Damon}. One of the titles Damon has given Qathindli is “The Unsullied.” He believes that she is holy because she has never been human, and therefore is above us and unsullied by her nature.</p><h2>Holy Text</h2><p>Qathindli has no holy text to speak of. As her knowledge of language grows, she has had Golar and Damon try to teach her how to write. The two main problems are that monkey hands are not designed for holding human writing utensils and Qathindli still has the mind of a monkey, so any given sentence contains multiple languages and bad translations, making them impossible to read. Damon still collects these “writings” and keeps them safe.</p></div>","markdown":""},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}}],"_stats":{"systemId":"dnd5e","systemVersion":"2.1.4","coreVersion":"10.291","createdTime":1662054505131,"modifiedTime":1675613756888,"lastModifiedBy":"EsIYTtNnjwxUbKOG"},"ownership":{"default":0,"R5IsvMTH5P79pBoG":3},"folder":"j9cXBagzZ1ARsO2I","sort":1000000},{"_id":"QVrlu0lTv2vFtT5P","name":"Klavek Kingdom","flags":{"monks-enhanced-journal":{"scrollPos":"{\".description\":0}","_lasttab":"description"},"core":{"sourceId":"Compendium.world.deities-of-aventyr.0FSVjV3WkdoAk7OX","viewMode":1},"scene-packer":{"hash":"af13afab06a078eaa241594be40fd382a54bd348"},"cf":{"id":null}},"pages":[{"name":"Klavek Kingdom","type":"text","title":{"show":false,"level":1},"text":{"format":1,"content":"<div class=\"aventyr\"><img style=\"display:block;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto\" src=\"modules/aaw-games-aventyr/Setting-images/Klavek-Kingdom-map-750x616.webp\" width=\"483\" height=\"445\" /></div>\n<div class=\"aventyr\"> </div>\n<div class=\"aventyr\"><img style=\"float:right;margin:0px 15px 15px 0px;border:0px\" title src=\"modules/aaw-games-aventyr/Setting-images/Mohkba-Royal-Guard-small.webp\" width=\"192\" height=\"383\" />\n<p>Sometimes referred to as the Klavek Homeland by its citizens, the Klavek Kingdom hosts the most powerful military in the known world.</p>\n<p>    The Klavek Kingdom is ruled by King Tokolvor XIII, a tyrannical leader and military genius.

The early @UUID[JournalEntry.QlctNkzE9injOde9.JournalEntryPage.DXD1ygEckY0JIUFB]{Klavekians} had spread from the borders of the elven woods toward the sea and built the first realms there before that time. But since almost everything built near the sea had been destroyed by the beast, the great evacuation that followed started a new age.</p>\n<img style=\"display:block;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto\" src=\"modules/aaw-games-aventyr/Setting-images/octopus-clip-art-2-640x413.jpg\" width=\"477\" height=\"354\" />\n<p>Immunity from attack, so rare in those days, caused the eastward movement of human colonization to become reversed. That is to say, settlers began to flow back from the old-established but now ravaged colonies of the Eastern Sea to the unoccupied lands near the Serpent Tail river. This constituted the first condition which, arising out of the geographical position of Mohkba, contributed to the successful settlement of the Mohkba region. Another condition which contributed to the growth of the Principality was the fact that Mohkba stood upon a river which had always – even from the most ancient times – been possessed of great commercial importance, a waterway connecting Central Klavek with the @UUID[JournalEntry.ismpCNWpGHvB1iPw.JournalEntryPage.Erya8w29cRTTJELu]{Serpent Lake} and its untouched resources. Of course these lucky years were way before the @UUID[JournalEntry.QlctNkzE9injOde9.JournalEntryPage.I4CpK8rTs0HgD7hW]{Vikmordere} discovered there was something worth raiding on the Serpent Tail river. The third factor was that said river was not connected to the eastern ocean and thus safe from the kraken.</p>\n<img style=\"display:block;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto\" src=\"modules/aaw-games-aventyr/Setting-images/Settlement-of-Mohkba-640x480.jpg\" width=\"449\" height=\"387\" />\n<p>Yuri Dvagaslov thus made Mohkba the point where two great popular movements intersected one another – namely, a movement of colonization northeastwards along the Serpent Tail river and a movement of commerce back southeastwards toward the sea once the kraken was sleeping again. The city’s geographical position conferred great economic advantages upon the early Princes of Klavek. A large population attracted to their appanage meant a large number of direct taxpayers, while the movement of a large volume of commercial traffic on the Serpent Tail river before the Vikmordere Wars meant a stimulation of popular industry in his dominions and a large flow of transit-dues into his treasury.</p>\n<p>The physical network of rivers leading toward the lake is first of all a transportation network. The early klavekians traveled the rivers and lake by boats in summer and with sleds over the ice in winter. But the river network supported social interaction. Trading of amber, honey and furs produced economic networks. Marriage alliances and divine exchanges both produced and strengthened social networks. And the frequent interaction permitted the klavekian language to spread and become so dominant over a wide area that it is now known simply as ‘common’.</p>\n<h2>Mohkba today</h2>\n<p>Mohkba has lots of quiet cozy lanes, wooden houses, an incredible number of monasteries and churches, and delicious pickles are on sale on every corner. The capital of Klavek is known for its great towers, most belonging to churches, but others to the nobility or to wizards. When alliances are forged due to marriages, illusions of bridges adorned with shared banners connect the towers, creating an ever changing scenery. Mohkba is composed out of eight quarters.

Be this as it may, the powerful monolithic massive structure of the monument still dominates not only the divine quarter, but the whole historic center of @UUID[.dwAJ5Jtc6ii8zQoh]{Mohkba}. The basis of its complex three-dimensional architecture is a four-domed, five-columned brick temple of the cross-and-cupola type with a high ground floor. It is built of brick and blue stone, and its blind arcades give it a special beauty and nobility. In the interior of this palladion a faithfuls attention is drawn by the unique historically formed iconostases icons. These are ancient mural paintings, national relics of Klavek that include the famous icon of Yuri Dvagaslov himself, the Holy Knight of the Crossroad. In the course of hundreds of years the Sophianeum was a center of the clerical, political and cultural life of ancient Mohkba.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<img style=\"float:right;margin:0px 15px 15px 0px;border:0px\" src=\"modules/aaw-games-aventyr/Setting-images/085-Cathedral-Tower-from-St-Johns-Street.jpg\" width=\"237\" height=\"316\" />\n<p>     Next to the Sophianeum is Alvarov’s Monastery that was founded by Prince Yaroslav the Witch as early as in the first century after the foundation of Mohkba, as a legend reads, and one cannot help being amazed by the striking beauty of another masterpiece of ancient Klavekian architecture. Many experts of Klavekian art justly believe Mohkba to be blessed by the Gods; no other old Klavekian cities have managed to preserve so many ancient architectural monuments adorned with wall murals. Visitors will see that with their own eyes visiting the churches of the Oreadean Gods on Vlassov Lake, appreciating at its true worth the old frescoes of world-famous Wulfgarin the Dwarf in the Church of the Enchantments on Vassili Street; singularly graceful murals in the Church of the Spirit of Bertramov on Prideful Field, admiring the beautiful clerical wall calendar of the Church of the Nameless Hero and studying wonderful mural compositions in The Sinless Cathedral. The later is also famous for its five-tier iconostasis with icons from up to four centuries ago.</p>\n<p>More mundane, but still very important are the Tower of the Inquisition and the Tower of the Order of the Elk, the latter the chivalric arm of the former and thus connected by a real bridge, one of the oldest non-illusionary bridges connecting Mohkba’s towers.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h3>Armour of Frozen Tears</h3>\n<p>When the @UUID[JournalEntry.QlctNkzE9injOde9.JournalEntryPage.I4CpK8rTs0HgD7hW]{Vikmordere} attacked @UUID[.dwAJ5Jtc6ii8zQoh]{Mohkba} in the old days, legend says that the face of Tsar Alexei VI was awash in tears of wrath, and that it was so cold during that attack that his tears freeze before hitting the ground. Those frozen tears were collected by a dwarven cleric and with the aid of an unknown smith forged into an armour of sparkling brilliance. Tsar Alexei himself wore the armour in the counterattack, when he charged the enemy at the front of his soldiers, and the vile Vikmordere magic dissipated into waterdrops while hitting the tsar, unable to harm him. While most of this tale seems to be a legend, the armour indeed does exist, and the tsars do wear it on the days of their coronation since the days of Tsar Gregory VI, twin brother and successor of Alexei. The armour is clearly magical, since it adjusts to the size of the monarch and even fitted Tsarina Anna’s very womanly body when her coronation came.</p>\n<p>The Armour of Frozen Tears is sky blue in colour, and in form unlike any other armour, though it somewhat resembles a flowing plate mail. The is no crest on the armour, nor any other sign, and, contradicting a then common legend, it can be worn by anyone, as was obvious after Mikhael the jester put it on during a festival. The armour also doesn’t prevent its wearer from being beheaded, which was also proven by said jester and the bodyguard of the enraged tsar. ‘To put on the frozen tears’ is now a common proverb for a daunting deed that went horribly wrong.</p>\n<p>The Armour of Frozen Tears is kept in the @UUID[.LGCNFtJ4cWlq0HjE#divine-quarter]{Sophianeum} and on display there, constantly guarded by a watch of honour.</p>\n<h3>The Tombstone of Bojar Pjotr</h3>\n<p>The Tombstone of Bojar Pjotr, build from marble and engraved with silver letters, describes the birth- and death-days of the Bojar Pjotr, who was known for his racial tolerance, and his bride, an unnamed Othyugh, who ate him at their wedding ceremony before being killed by the guests. Since that day the tombstone is used to promote racial purism, to be an outstanding example of foolish behaviour, to always come armed to a wedding and for lots of other more or less sensible things. But over the years the jokes gradually went sour, for even as Pjotr didn’t leave any relatives, the tombstone is always polished, and fresh flowers do appear next to it on the day of his birth, the day of both deaths and on a third day, which is supposed to be the birthing day of the proud bride. In later years a small fence was build around the tombstone, and now lovers faced with huge obstacles throw a flower inside the fenced area, where they lie fresh long after that should be possible, only to vanish without trace when another flower is thrown inside. It is known that the burden of the lovers is eased in some minor way as long as their flower is inside the fence, and that each pair of lovers may only throw one flower for this boon. Should there be no major obstacle to the love, or a second flower be thrown, then their flower withers away immediately, without replacing the last one, and bad luck is guaranteed for a month and a day. It also seems to matter what flower is chosen, a rose having other effects than a lily for instance, but that may be coincidence. Nonetheless there have been desperate lovers who went searching for a @UUID[JournalEntry.ismpCNWpGHvB1iPw.JournalEntryPage.w79VOo3UeUGraouv#winterflower]{Winterflower}, a rare wildflower supposed to grow in the northern mountains near the outpost of @UUID[JournalEntry.ismpCNWpGHvB1iPw]{Rybalka}, to better their chances for success.</p>\n<h3>Cold Iron Gate</h3>\n<p>The Cold Iron Gate is the impressive relict of a great effort to defeat the @UUID[JournalEntry.QlctNkzE9injOde9.JournalEntryPage.ei36LjIhEoh87vgE]{elves} and their fey allies once and for all. There is much disagreement about the details of the plan, but most sages agree that all walls and gates of @UUID[.dwAJ5Jtc6ii8zQoh]{Mohkba} were planned to be coated in cold iron. There are many different opinions about details though, if every town of the realm was to be coated in cold iron, and if the cold iron was meant to hold the fey outside or trap them inside instead. There is even a discussion if the elves themselves were hampered by cold iron in those ancient days, since they clearly aren’t in modern times. Whatever it is, after one gate was ready the whole plan was stopped due to lack of money. In modern days the Gate is infamous on the one hand, leading to the proverb of ‘he even has a cold iron toilet’ for someone with too much money, but oddly something of pride also, for it was a very ambitious project to say the least, and even unfinished its a symbol for Mohkba aiming very high. The Cold Iron Gate itself is somewhat barren, there are no gravels, signs or whatever in it, and has a dull blue colour that has appeared over time, since old texts describe the gate as being the colour of a grey stormcloud. Watchmen tell that the Cold Iron Gate is easier to close and to open then other gates of equal size. No invader has ever tried to break this gate down, so the ultimate test for the defensive attributes has not happened yet.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>Arcane Quarter</h2>\n<p> </p>\n<img style=\"float:right;margin:0px 15px 15px 0px;border:0px\" src=\"modules/aaw-games-aventyr/Setting-images/Wizard-with-Golem.webp\" width=\"252\" height=\"346\" />\n<p>The Arcane quarter is the only part of Mohkba without religious buildings. Not contend with lonely wizardly towers, the arcane wielders of Mohkba combined their resources to build the emerald fortress in the then Arcane suburb, now known as the somewhat infamous Fortress of the Arcane Arts. This fortress was mentioned in chronicles as early as five years after the foundation of the Sophianeum. The present walls and towers were constructed in a single night 200 years later. The central building of the emerald fortress is the four-domed college of Mutamateria, nicknamed ‘Transformation Cathedral’ to the chargrin of the clerics. The walls of the college are separated by pilasters with zakomari that were adorned with painting as far back as the 4th century after its foundation. The pinnacle of architecture when it was erected has a grandiose size and sensational shape, with eight cupolas, one for each school of magic, dazzling with luxury and an abundance of tiles, brick patterns and frescos. It is a real encyclopedia of arcane scenes which has no equivalent in Klavekian art. Today it is also connected with, or somewhat has overgrown, the Alchemists College, with is now part of the emerald fortress.</p>\n<h2>King’s Fortress</h2>\n<img style=\"float:right;margin:0px 15px 15px 0px;border:0px\" src=\"modules/aaw-games-aventyr/Setting-images/elizabethan-costumes-3.jpg\" width=\"270\" height=\"288\" />\n<p>The King’s Fortress was closely related to all the most important events in the life of ancient Mohkba: hosting foreign embassies, seeing-off warriors to fight the enemy, convening meetings of the Crown’s Advisors. Many centuries ago, the whole fortress was surrounded by ramparts, on which stood strong log walls and fortress towers. They served as reliable protection during the internecine wars of the Klavekian princes, but were later burned by Vikmordere invaders. Today, in a much safer age, nothing but a high wall remains.</p>\n<p>In addition to the above-mentioned Sophianeum, the King’s Fortress also features other striking monuments as the Faceted Palace – a rare specimen of elven architecture, built in the times of Vassily Elf-Friend jointly with elven masters, as well as the impressive and beautiful bellfry with a set of adamantit bells. In the central square of the King’s Fortress stands the monument “The Millenium of Klavek”, designed by Quincov the Stout and erected a bit prematurely 940 years after the foundation of Klavek by Tsar Alexei the Impatient. This unique document in bronze immortalizes all those who greatly contributed to the development of the country: its culture, science, art and literature, but also its tsars and war-heroes. The klavekian special political structure, spiritual freedom and territorial independence were highly favorable to the evolution of culture and art, and this is justly celebrated in the political heart of Klavek. Mohkba is one of the greatest art centers of the human world. Its architectural traditions, skaldic tales, school of icon-painting, jeweler’s and decorative applied art became famous all over the known world. Mohkba also is Klavekia’s major center of literacy and book production. As far back as the foundation years, by the will of the great Prince Yuri Dvagaslov himself, Mohkba saw the first school to train three hundred children at a time.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h3>The Emerald Casket</h3>\n<p>Once only known to a selected few trusted advisors of the Tsar, @UUID[.LGCNFtJ4cWlq0HjE#the-bridge-that-is-there-and-not-there]{ The Bridge That Is There And Not} There is supposed to be not the only legacy of Grigory Rivalnov. During the Time of Troubles a group of mercenaries took hold of the @UUID[.LGCNFtJ4cWlq0HjE#kings-fortress]{King’s Fortress} for a short time, and from these originated what is now a common legend. Deep under the King’s Fortress there’s an emerald casket, presumably holding the last of the Sinner Tsars in suspension, until a time where the lineage of Tsars is broken. There are some facts contradicting this tale, as the lineage of Tsars has been broken a few times in the past (most famously after the death of Tsarina Anna in 1143) and suspension doesn’t sound like illusionist magic, but still the legend persists. The Casket itself is rumored to be a huge emerald, hence the name, with a vague ageless male human shape enclosed in it. While nobody reliable has set her eyes on the casket in recent decades and talked about it, there are nonetheless many works of art depicting it in the city, even one monument in @UUID[.LGCNFtJ4cWlq0HjE#mariners-quarter]{Mariner’s Quarter}. Those works vary in many details from each other though, and there are ongoing and somewhat heated discussions which one looks more like the famous original.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>Trade-yard</h2>\n<p>On the opposite bank of the river, reachable by a footbridge, is Beatricov’s Court and the ancient Trade-yard, displaying many still-standing monuments of the early days of Klavek, all reminiscent of the busy trade life of Mohkba in the days before the Vikmordere Wars. Originally made of wood, it was almost completely destroyed by fire. Later new walls with defensive towers were erected. Not surprisingly, the symbol of the Trade-yard is a stone fortress, surrounded by an even more ancient earthen wall.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<img style=\"float:right;margin:0px 15px 15px 0px;border:0px\" src=\"modules/aaw-games-aventyr/Setting-images/237-The-Butcher-Newport-Market-Alley.jpg\" width=\"258\" height=\"233\" />\n<p>Nearly every house in the Trade-yard has a unique history and the central part of the quarter is one big architectural complex. The Beatricovan trading gallery is one of the biggest complexes in Klavekia. The layout is based on the plan of a typical merchant’s shop with trading on the ground floor and storage rooms in the attic and cellar. Rumors place the home of Klavek’s Thieves Guild here, but surely the Tsar’s Inquisitors would have ferreted this out long ago if there was any truth to the rumor.</p>\n<p>The most famous monument of the Trade-yard certainly is the Cube of Names for the most famous warrior-heroes of the first days of Mohkba, the greatest clerics, summoners, magi and oracles. The lower side on which the cube rests is supposed to show the names of rogues, the tsar’s under-hand, hidden even in the present. In the Trade-yard the ancient contracts are still stored, including such world-famous items as a great number of birch-bark scrolls and lead seals dating back to the founding years. These are indicative of a unique and striking level of literacy among ancient klavekians who were certainly and contrary to elven prejudices no barbarians at all and had a highly organized system of state control from the beginning.</p>\n<h3>The Hundred Candle Steps</h3>\n<p>When Yevgeni VI. married the elven lady Arianna Greenleaf in 692 his bride did make a grand entrance into @UUID[.dwAJ5Jtc6ii8zQoh]{Mohkba}. The last hundred steps of hers before she kissed the Tsar for the first time left footprints on the street, and immediatly after her delicate feet left the street a single cobblestone in each footprint went into tiny flames. Those flames still burn, a small but bright yellow light, unless @UUID[.ulLkhApELbg08M4o]{Klavek} is at war with the elves, when the flames change colour to blue.</p>\n<p>The flames may be extinguished easily, but they reflame on their own after a few minutes. They are unaffected by normal wind. The street were they are located is the street of the candlemakers and other trades who can use the handy open flames for their trade. It is one of the few tolerated displays of magic in the town since a rampaging troll could be stopped with help of these flames many years ago.</p>\n<h3>The Grand Scales</h3>\n<p>The @UUID[.LGCNFtJ4cWlq0HjE#trade-yard]{Trade-yard} has seen its share of good trades and bad trades, but also of frauds and con artists. Tsar Ironhand has had enough of that one day after his custom officers were cheated on a stormy night with a wooden block coated in gold and he commissioned the building of the Grand Scale, which is the height of a small building and able to weigh up to two tons of raw material. Its difficult and time consuming to handle, but very accurate and gives a +2 to appraise checks for raw materials. Rumours say that both the con artist and the custom officers are all part of the scale now, having been turned into the construction by magic or melted together with the iron from which is was built. In stormy nights they are rumoured to still wail for the tsars mercy.</p>\n<h2>Carpenter’s Quarter</h2>\n<p>Like every other separated part of Mohkba Carpenter’s Quarter has its own wall. The main gate connecting Carpenter’s quarter to the King’s Fortress has a famous décor on the outside, comprising three monumental tile compositions: To the right of the southern portal is a round bas-relief depicting Prince Yaroslav the Witch and under the arches of the side facades are two scenes of workers laboring. These unique ancient Klavekian tiles date back to first century after the foundation.</p>\n<p>The other way into this quarter is Nikolsky Gate. Behind it is the small “bridge of happiness,” hung with padlocks. At the edges of the bridge are two horseshoes of a centaur, one of which reads: “Eternal Love” in the language of the horsefolk. Holding hands, lovers go through the large horseshoe and walk on the eight small ones on the bridge. According to legend, a female centaur ambassador broke its horseshoe here on a stone, being dazzled by the sight of a Klavekian cavalry officer. To this day the “stone of desires” sits close to the bridge.</p>\n<p>Despite its name, Carpenter’s quarter has long been famous for its furriers and shoemakers. On the streets are a lot of wooden houses, stone mansion from the end of the century before last, as well as trading arcades new and preserved.</p>\n<p>Carpenter’s quarter is also known for its Abandoned Monastry, a building which stands empty for about 300 years now. Here False Yuri II (Grishka Raulyev) met the nun Tatyana, the widow of Alexei IV, Maria Poterowa, who had entered the monastery. She recognized the pretender as her son, Yuri. This was the trigger for the Troubles, an euphemistic name for one of the meanest of the Klavekian civil wars. Due to that sad part of Klavekian history the monastery is empty now, but still a fantastic sight. In the old days, in the minds of the people, the greatness of a monastery was always connected to the height of its belltower. The architectural center of the Carpenter’s Quarter is one of the highest belltowers in Klavekia, more than 89 meters high. Monumental and steadfast, it does not look overly heavy because of its many columns, wide arched openings and decoration, which contains Alexei’s monograms. The dome of the seven-storied belltower is decorated with the imperial crown – the monastry had always been under the special patronage of the tsars. On the orders of Metropolitan Vladimir, 8 bells were cast for it, including “The Bear”, the largest bell in Mohkba. Each has its own tone, but all together they allow the ringer to create a perfect harmonic composition, a gem of world cultural heritage, the Mohkba chimes. When the angels first heard it legend claimed they cried, creating the lake of Mohkba. Since the Troubles the bells are silent and refuse to ring, a sign that toppled the claim of false Yuri II more than anything else. Countless priests and magicians have tried to revive the chime since those days to no avail. Standing near “The Bear” they could only enjoy the stunning views of the river and the Bridge of Happiness across it.</p>\n<p>The boundless forests outside Mohkba behind the bridge are equally beautiful in summer as in winter, in morning as in evening. Mohkba and Mohkba region have long been intensely cultivated by man, perhaps more than any other region of Klavekia. Yet nature still occupies a huge part of it with clean lakes and rivers, and wild forests. It is hard to believe, but today forests still cover a huge part of Mohkba region, and with some luck one can still see wild animals looking from the belltower. One should take care though, the monastry is neglected and the stairs are somewhat unsafe.</p>\n<h3>The Bridge That Is There And Not There</h3>\n<p>Grigorij Rivalnov was the greatest Illusionist Mohkba has known in its long history, living in the days of the Sinner Tsars. It is told that once, at the 25th birthday of Tsar Anatol V., he changed the whole capital so that it looked like covered in molted gold, sparkling in the sunrise. Another story is not that beautiful, telling a tale where the Illusionist came to the Tsarina in the night disguised by foul magic to resemble the Tsar. Whether that tale is true or not, it was used against the Tsarevitch during the civil war after the death of Anatol V., claiming the young prince to be a wizard’s bastard. It was one of the many reasons why magic is so distrusted in Klavek up to the present time.</p>\n<p>Be the stories true or false, most of Rivalnov’s illusion have been banned or timed out over the long years since his death, save for the famous Bridge That Is There And Not There, or Rivalnov’s Bridge. It looks like a sturdy stone bridge, including small statues of famous citizens of Mohkba from the time where it was cast, most prominent among them the tsar and tsarina (but not the tsarevitch) in the middle of it. The bridge is famous enough that most people of Klavek know its an illusion, but nonetheless whoever attemps to cross it for the first time has to make a will save. If she fails, she is able to cross it for the rest of her life, even inside a carriage if every other passenger and the horses failed also. If she succeeds, she falls straight through the illusion and most likely takes a cold bath in the river. Most citizens of Mohkba are able to cross the bridge freely, having failed their save as children when they still believed in wonders.</p>\n<p>Of course its a common prank among teenagers to guide foreigners over the bridge, telling them about the illusion while doing so and laughing the moment the strangers take a bath.</p>\n<h3>The Unprotected Ruby</h3>\n<p>On a plaza in the midst of @UUID[.LGCNFtJ4cWlq0HjE#carpenters-quarter]{Carpenter’s Quarter} is an ebony pedestal with a flawless fist-sized red ruby on it. It is not protected by any means, and in fact has been stolen four times already, but always was returned in a week at most. It is obviously worth a fortune, should someone find a buyer for it, but doing that is the difficult part. Tied to the ruby is bad luck of the gravest sort, so most who did ever handle it for more than a few hours died horribly, and no one has managed to break that curse, if it is a curse at all. If the gem is returned to the pedestal all is well again, save for some scars, wounds or broken bones from the time of possessing the gem, but no unusual bad luck happens again. Sages have wondered about the properties of the Unprotected Ruby for long, and examined it – usually from afar – but no one knows its secret. Legend claims one tsar or another, the details vary, paid tribute to the @UUID[JournalEntry.QlctNkzE9injOde9.JournalEntryPage.I4CpK8rTs0HgD7hW]{Vikmordere} with this specially prepared gem, to weaken the enemy by cursing their leaders, but the gem had been returned after some time or never delivered at all after killing its maker in a weird accident which centered around a goose, a flower and a nail.</p>\n<h3>Watching Torches</h3>\n<p>In the Street of the Eye, where once the royal treasury was located, is one of the few magical features of Mohkba of the divine nature. Dating back to the years of Pjotr the Pius in ancient times the Grand Robbery of the treasury shook @UUID[.dwAJ5Jtc6ii8zQoh]{Mohkba} to the core. Pjotr did pray to the Guardian God for help against further occurences of this kind, and some claim that he could do not much else but pray after being poor like a goblin thanks to the thieves. Be this as it may, the street once leading to the treasury has magical torches to this day. They catch fire the moment an intelligent creature comes in 40 feet of them, and they sputter out with no one in the vicinity any longer. It was a very efficient warning system until the Second Great Robbery of the treasury which was committed with the help of golems. After the @UUID[JournalEntry.QlctNkzE9injOde9.JournalEntryPage.I4CpK8rTs0HgD7hW]{Vikmordere} plundered the treasury twice, each time illuminated by torchlight, it was relocated to a more secure location, and today wonderworkers, con artists and charlatans have their shops in the torchlit street, to the chargrin of many clerics. They sell everything, from splinters of the true bowl that graced the Empty Pedestal once, enough of them to build a glass dome over @UUID[.dwAJ5Jtc6ii8zQoh]{Mohkba} as the critics claim, to bones of the Sinner Tsars or the head of the Vikmordere chieftain Angus the Old from the days when he was still a child. Sometimes true magic can be found here, so its a place visited by many for its sense of wonder and promises.</p>\n<h3>The Floating Tower</h3>\n<p>When Klavek was young and mostly build of wood two rival families had a feud with each other that slowly escalated. One night the tower of one of the families was put to the torch by its rival, and the ground burned to ashes – but the ground only. The tower is still there to this day, the only wooden tower of this height in the town, but it has no first floor. Indeed it floats from the second floor up, but it stays in place no matter the wind. It was even inhabitat a while afterwards, but with the distrust in magic growing the family that owned it later moved away and now is rumoured to have left no inheritors. There have been some attempts in the past to remove or destroy the floating tower, but none did succeed so far. Today the floating tower is protected by the military, mostly to prevent hotheads from another attempt to burn it – along with the rest of the town while trying.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>Mariner’s quarter</h2>\n<p>Mariner’s quarter is the underbelly of @UUID[.dwAJ5Jtc6ii8zQoh]{Mohkba}, known for its cheap brothels and ramshackle pubs. But even in this bad place is a national icon to be found, the Navy Museum, a colorful painted wooden house. It exhibits the wooden boat, great-grandfather of Klavekia’s navy, that was sent out on the water of the Lake of Angelic Tears by the young Tsar Alexei III. Sadly that’s the only thing exhibited in the whole museum.</p>\n<p>According to legend, there was a stone idol standing in what is now the Mariner’s quarter that the ancient centaurs worshiped. The hermit Natalya prayed and received a magical staff from a divine elk with which she destroyed the idol, and then built a church on the site of the pagan shrine. Before going to fight the Vikmordere, Tsar Alexei the Twin made a pilgrimage to the monastery to take the staff of Natalya. After the battle of the Serpent, the tsar in gratitude built a cathedral where the church stood, one of the first multi-altar churches, which have additional altars dedicated to different gods. The interior of this cubic six-domed church is unusual: The arches are supported by five pillars, which gives the effect of volume. It could justifiably be called the pearl of that period of Klavekian architecture and its domes, walls, door frames and all other available surfaces are full of mural paintings. In modern days the cathedral is seldom visited, and but the altar of the gods dedicated to the sea and to long voyages is cleaned regularly. The staff of Natalya is rumored to have inspired Tarissov the Leprous in building the first @UUID[.1hMoSKS1OqlchIwq#the-blank-staffs]{Blank Staff}. This made his treason the more unbearable and added to the neglect of the Church of Natalya’s Staff.</p>\n<h3>The Empty Pedestal</h3>\n<p>In the Harbour area stands the famous Empty Pedestal, by itself a rather blank structure with no artistic value whatsoever, but in ancient time Leo II, The Tsar in the Bowl, had his crystal home on this pedestal overlooking the harbour and looking for outside help to break his curse. Its not clear who cursed him or why, and tales blame everyone from the Vikmordere, the clerics, the magicians to his own relatives for the vile deed. His grandson did break the bowl in 173, not wanting to be a mere regent as his father has been, thereby killing the tsar or what was left of him and provoking a short civil war known as the days of the Cleared Succession or the days of the Murdering Tsar by his enemies. The infamous victory speech by Tsar Leo IV was held standing on the very pedestal that held his grandfather for so many decades, and it was one of the longest and most winding speeches in the history of Mohkba, rumoured to have crashed the last resistance to his rule by boring all dissidents to death. Leo IV was known as the chattering tsar or the shattering tsar for many decades until Tsar Anatol VIII decided the matter almost 150 years later by naming Leo IV the Tsar who Broke the Bowl. Until today the people of Mohkba express their feelings toward the government by placing various fishes on the empty pedestal, each of them with a different meaning. Knowing which fish means what is a science in itself and a riddle to even many people of Mohkba, let alone foreign guests. Most governments see any fish in any position and any state of decay as an insult to them nowadays, which lets the pedestal been guarded most of the time and certainly when government is cutting public spending or raising taxes.</p>\n<h3>Dancing Skeleton</h3>\n<p>Once during the many wars with the Vikmordere a regiment of Klavekian archers managed to surprise a ritual by the Vikmordere. Suspecting a vile purpose of this ritual the archers peppered everyone attending in the grove, slaying everyone – almost. When the storm of arrows ceased, only the leading shaman was still on his feet and dancing, amidst a sea of dead. The next volley of arrows hit him exclusively, but, even being obviously dead, the dance continued. The Klavekian were scared, but took the shaman captive, without getting any response from him. Even bound he twitched in his dance moved with vacant, dead eyes. Back in Mohkba the shaman was showered with positive energy to no avail and ultimately thrown in a pool of acid, where his flesh receded, but his skeleton still danced. It was bound again and put away in a deep cell.</p>\n<p>An unknown number of decades later Tsar Alexei V., later called the ‘Mad Tsar’, decided to bolster morale of the citizens by putting the shaman on display. So the skeleton dances on a pedestal, at first closely watched by clerics and guards, but these days only by an honour guard of veterans of Klavekian skirmishes or battles with the Vikmordere. Oddly enough the few Vikmordere ambassadors that have visited Mohkba and seen the shaman have been reported to not be offended by the sight, but smiling knowingly, which unsettled more than one of the veterans guarding the Dancing Skeleton. But since the skeleton is dancing for more than 250 years by now and nothing visibly bad has come out of it yet, the citizens of Mohkba see the Dancing Skeleton as nothing more than a celebrated oddity, a trophy of war and a symbol of the weirdness of their Vikmordere neighbors.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h3>Spitting Statue</h3>\n<p>At the harbour of @UUID[.dwAJ5Jtc6ii8zQoh]{Mockba} is the statue of Dimitrij Denisonovitch, most honoured advisor to Tsar Pjotr the Diplomat and, for a very short time, of his successor Alexei the Twin. Denisonovitch is portrait as an especially ugly man, with an evil looking face, a long hook-like nose and a hunchback. It is well known that he featured none of this in his life, having been a rather handsome and charismatic man, but he counseled his Tsars toward accepting surrender and tribute to the Vikmordere, like Mohkba paid to the Saatman Empire before. His statue was erected to remember the people of the price of betrayal, for Denisonovitch was beheaded on the very first day of the reign of Alexei the Twin in 1096 for this craven council, and until this day passerby spit on the statue as their sign of national pride. There are rumours though that before 1096 there had been another statue of Denisonovitch, built by Pjotr the Diplomat for former successes of his councellor, showing the real self with a concerned face, and some people did cut themselves in front of this statue of Denisonovitch to let a drop of blood or two spill at his feet, for in the first battles of the Twin’s war theVikmordere claimed much blood of Mohkba and won most of them. Denisonovitchs council seemed wiser those days, but with the shifting tides of war and victory increasingly favouring Mohkba the old statue was toppled and later replaced by the new and ugly one, and today a different body fluid is offered to the advisor that failed from grace.</p>\n<h3>Statue of the Shamans</h3>\n<p>In the Vikmordere wars, Mohkba was frequently plundered, at least in parts, but at one time the Vikmordere tried to stay to conquer the town of their enemies once and for all. Chieftain Angus the Old died shortly after this decision, many claiming being struck down by the gods for his decision, and the Vikmordere went away to being splintered tribes as before. But a relic from those days is the statue of ice, vaguely build like a sea snake, was left behind by the Vikmordere. It still is in the @UUID[.LGCNFtJ4cWlq0HjE#mariners-quarter]{Mariner’s Quarter} as a warning from the Vikmordere threat, an oddity from times long past, and a part of the city defences. The serpent statue has a faint glimmer of conjuration magic. If touched and used as a focus component during the casting of summon swarm, summon monster or summon nature’s ally, and the spell is used to summon a serpent swarm or giant serpent, the spell lasts for an additional round, and, in the case of a summoned swarm, the swarm does not attack the caster, so long as he retains hold of the statue, allowing him to stand freely in the area of the swarm. The statue provides no such protection against serpent swarms conjured by others or encountered normally.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>Gardener’s quarter</h2>\n<p>On the Gardener’s quarter’s central square, Natalyaskaya Ploshchad, stands a monument in honor of the hermit Natalya. Natalyaskaya Ploshchad practically runs into another square, named after Yuri Sansurov who sacrificed his life for the sake of young tsar Alexei the Twin. Outside Gardener’s Quarter is Chistoye Boloto, the clean bog, into which Sansurov led the Vikmordere who had come to capture the Klavekian tsar, there by sacrifying himself for his tsar.</p>\n<p>The Gardener’s quarter has an elk farm in honor of Natalya the hermit. This is one of the few places in the world where druids have been successfully breeding elks for 90 years now. Pilgrims can not only take a good look at the elks but interact with them too. Trying elk milk is an absolute must since it has an unusual flavor and is known to grant divine favors every few years.</p>\n<p>There are about 15 gardens and parks in the Gardener’s quarter alone. A favorite recreation spot is the pine wood within its center. Here is the Klavekian Calling celebrated, the traditional custom for greeting the spring, calling the elks and the warming sun. Its on a small but long hill with a spring near its top, and in winter few children can resist the temptation to slide down the frozen slippery slope on their backsides or on sledges. The spring is also famous throughout Mohkba for its water purity.</p>\n<p>There are more than 13 bridges in the quarter. Many artisans come here for inspiration, which visitors are reminded of by monuments to writers, painters and druids that decorate gardens, parks and promenades. In the warm season there are six fountains in the squares and parks leading to ponds, little waterfalls and a boulder three-span bridge decorated with a unique carved iconostasis of rose, walnut and birch.</p>\n<p>Gardeners quarter was once the private property of the son of a simple Gardener. In childhood he fled from his father to a neighboring village, where he lived with the priest and sang in church. His beautiful voice drew the attention of a major who was driving by, who took the boy and brought him to Mohkba, to the delight of the tsarina, Tatjana Valakova, who loved his beautiful singing. The 22-year-old ‘voice of an angel’ became involved with the princess Anna Alexeievna. After she became tsarina, she awarded her lover some property and the rank of general, marrying him in secret. The influence wielded by this favorite of the tsarina became colossal, as did his wealth and land ownership. However, Gregory the Gardener remained throughout a modest and pious man, who financed the construction of many churches and always viewed his exalted status with humor. Later, when offering an explanation for Anna’s choice, one of her nieces recalled Gregory as one of the most beautiful men she had met in her whole life. After his death he dedicated his beloved garden to the people of Mohkba, to be tended by druids, and thus Gardener’s Quarter was founded and named after him.</p>\n<h2>Zveni Island</h2>\n<p>The Mohkba Lake’s individual shape can be explained by its glacial origins. It is in fact several lakes, joined to each other by short narrow canals, stretching in a chain from west to east for 50 kilometers. At its eastern end, at the mouth of Serpent Tail River, is Zveni Island. Its thus far away from the capital, but Alexei the Twin deemed it so important that he named it part of the capital itself, and that was never changed. The decision made Mohkba the biggest town of the world, at least if one measures size by east-west miles.</p>\n<p>On the remote Zveni island a monastery had been built, which today is connected with the mainland by bridge. In the early days of the empire a hermit called Gregory settled on the island. He was given the nickname Stolbensky, from the word “stolb” meaning pillar. After his death, fame spread far and wide of his the healing power, and the monastery became a center of pilgrimage, one of the largest in Klavekia. Not many years later an unique ensemble came together, and today the monastery comprises seven churches and 30 buildings in the tradition of Mohkba architecture. The shores of the island were reinforced with granite embankments. The monastery became a veritable “city of clerics,” a little part of Mohkba by some miracle abandoned in the wilderness of the region.</p>\n<p>As told in a legend, Zveni got its name, ‘bell-tolling’, thanks to its bells, which rang out for hundreds of miles around. When neighboring villages heard them, they also began to sound the alarm by tolling bells, and so on until the signal reached Mohkba, warning the capital of the kingdom of the approach of the Vikmordere enemy. Thus, Zverni was destroyed many times, and rebuilt after every attack. The Tsars did this in part out of piety, in part out of military thoughts and in part because the island became sort of a repository for unwanted wives and daughters and politically dangerous persons of both genders. To die on the island is said to grant a dying limited wish, but it has to be worded carefully and can’t have a political or military approach, for the first tsar who had died on the island, Gregory the Other Twin, also known as the Shortlived, had wished it so.</p>\n<p>Entry to the monastery is through two arches, one of which stands at the bridge, and the other at the pier. Rebuilt only a few years ago, it nonetheless is famous for its rich decoration of klavekian baroque and frescoes in the style of oreadean masters. The main hall is bright and spacious with four pillars that bear arches. On the walls are two thematic series: seven paintings depicting the various battles with the Vikmordere and four illustrating the Miracles of Gregory Stolbensky.</p>\n<p>Water clarity in this part of the lake can be up to 5 meters. The lake is inhabited by about 20 species of fish, including smelt, bream, perch, burbot, whitefish, ide and pike, but also the occasional sea serpent. The forests are rich with game and poultry. There is a park on the shore, overlooking the lake, and a cape in the south of the island is covered with meadows. On the very point of the headland is a snow-white church which has miraculously survived the last two Vikmordere attacks unharmed.</p>\n</div>","markdown":""},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"sort":700000,"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}},{"name":"Klavekian Grasslands","type":"text","_id":"J642N3NDDUewmTFn","title":{"show":false,"level":1},"image":{},"text":{"format":1,"content":"<div class=\"aventyr\"><p class=\"s5\">Klavekian Grasslands</p><h2>Weather</h2><p>The winters on the Klavekian Grasslands last seven to nine months. Temperatures vary from −40 °C to 36 °C throughout the year. The summers are short but sometimes even hot, with plant life exploding as to make up for a whole year in but a few weeks.</p><p>The grassy plains in the Klavekian lowlands are a very windy area, with winds often blowing upwards of 40–90 km/h. It lies on top of permanently frozen soil called permafrost.</p><p>During the spring, the permafrost thaws just enough to let plants grow and reproduce. The ground below it stays frozen though, so the water can’t sink low, and so forms the streams, lakes and marshes found during the snowless months.</p><p>Rivers of the Klavekian Grassland flow over the same permafrost, so they erode their banks rather than the bottoms. They usually consist of countless channels, and can be difficult to cross. Most of them dry out after the end of the thawing period, leaving not many traces behind them until the next spring.</p><p>Most of the permanent rivers freeze to the bottom in some places. Water breaks the ice and then freezes on top of it. These ice plugs, called naled in the region, often don’t melt until the next autumn. If this happens on the important Serpent Tail River, which connects the @UUID[.ulLkhApELbg08M4o]{Klavekian mainlands} to the @UUID[JournalEntry.ismpCNWpGHvB1iPw.JournalEntryPage.Erya8w29cRTTJELu]{Serpent Lake}, it’s a major obstacle for trade, so the government sends spellcasters to remove these dangers by magical fire. Travel is not easy in these times of the year, and sometimes there are casualties in spite of the government efforts. Locals want the magicians to be permanently located near their villages, or at least for the duration of winter, but that has not been ordered so far despite of the protests.</p><p></p><h2>Flora</h2><p>As soon as the snow melts, the “Klavekian Pervenets” (The Firstborn) grows up thickly around the rivers and lakes. This huge grassy plant announces the start of the growing season after the winter is gone. Its juice has a sweet taste, but leaves blisters and sores on the skin that ache for months and has a 50% chance of lowering the dexterity score by one point until healed. The people of the three villages extract a form of sweet sugar out of it, and also distill wine that produces wonderful dreams after just one or two glasses. The dreams can carry portents sometimes; there is a 5% chance per glass drunk, up to a maximum of 10%, that the drinker can cast augury like a caster of third level right after waking up, regardless of his real class level or even if she is no spellcaster at all. The augury may happen or not, but another side effect does always take place; in the morning the drinker feels miserable and is nauseated for the next three hours per glass imbibed. Strangely the wine distilled out of Klavekian Pervenets as well as the juice itself loses its potency after only three days, so transporting it to larger markets is a huge challenge.</p><p>Maybe even better known in Klavek is one kind of plant that appears shortly after the Firstborn, but keeps growing in huge patches until late autumn. Talgana is a truly giant herb that reaches up to 3,5ms in height, a remarkable example of the famously tall forms of Klavek flora. In autumn, the stems can hide a wooly rhino easily. Inside the thickets, the sun and skies are hidden by the broad leaves, and bears’ paths cleave the wall of stems like tunnels. Talgana’s leaves are soft and its stems are easy to move apart with hands or a stick. Its young sprouts are edible, so much so that for bears they are a remedy against hunger in the early summer when there are neither berries nor fish yet. In winter-time, with snow on their umbels, these giants look like exotic trees, and numerous stories for children link them to fairies, but such a link is not proven by sages. They finally cave-in under their white burden when winter takes its course.</p><p>Aside from these endemic plants, this region supports numerous other species of rare flora, particularly grasses, herbs and shrubs. These shrublands are difficult to cross and full of bugs and other insects in summer, but they are a much better place than the neighboring regions for surviving the winter. A lot of wildlife uses them as shelter.</p><h2>Fauna</h2><p>One of the world’s largest herds of moose breeds in the Klavekian Grasslands, and there are three kinds of elk living here, from the smaller normal elks up to the river elk and then onto the megaloceras, but all in all the region is known for its megafauna. Vast herds travel the flatland, most of them following the seasons by going north in spring and south in autumn. They are followed by their predators like the smilodons or ice trolls in most cases, but there are exceptions to the hunting techniques used by creatures such as this, as described in the next paragraph.</p><p>One of the greatest predators in the Grasslands is the addanc, which lives like a beaver and builds dams. When prey tries to cross the water in its territory, it attacks like a crocodile. The various oozes of the region, most notably the grey ooze, the glacial ooze and the white pudding, also tend to be lurking hunters. However, the king of the Grasslands is the one-eyed frostwurm, which even attacks herds of mammoth. It radiates cold, is 35 feet long and weighs 8,000 pounds.</p><p>Other strange hunters include the flightless Ahlinni-birds or the hunting parties of Mimi, the sole fairy of the Grasslands, which have their villages mostly in the nearby forest, but roam the plains for prey. Also on the plains are the fogwarden (spelt the same for singular and plurals), aberrations that look like fog taking a humanoid form. The sight of their ice blue eyes has doomed more than one adventurer who had seen herself as a predator, not prey.</p><p>Maybe the most unusual species for this environment is the Kolasuchus, an amphibian, because it is known for surviving deep freezes, as low as -35 to -40°C. In some cases Kolasuchi have been known to remain frozen in permafrost for years, and after thawing, just walking off.</p><h2>Lake Voltaran</h2><p>One of the few permanent lakes in the Klavekian Grassland is Lake Voltaran, an enormous flooded volcanic caldera where more than a million salmon gather and spawn every year. The water is warm and doesn’t freeze in winter due to volcanic activity or a quasi-dormant gate to the Elemental Plane of Fire, depending on what sage you are listening to. The lake is a lifesaver for many species in the dead of winter, prey or predator, but a hunting ground for very dangerous monsters also. Travelers are wise to avoid it if their lifes don’t depend on its warmth.</p></div>","markdown":""},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"sort":800000,"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}},{"name":"Klavekian Staffweaving","type":"text","_id":"1hMoSKS1OqlchIwq","title":{"show":false,"level":1},"image":{},"text":{"format":1,"content":"<div class=\"aventyr\"><p class=\"s5\">Klavekian Staffweaving</p><h2>The Blank Staffs</h2><p>When confronted with the strange @UUID[JournalEntry.QlctNkzE9injOde9.JournalEntryPage.I4CpK8rTs0HgD7hW]{Vikmordere} magic the traditional wizards of the @UUID[.ulLkhApELbg08M4o]{Klavekian Empire} were at first at a total loss. No one had ever seen such magic as the savage Northmenn could wield. The Vikmordere wouldn’t explain how they did it for obvious reasons and Vikmorere prisoners sooner died then shared tribal secrets. Explorers sent to neighboring lands came back empty handed also.</p><p>Finally, Tarissov the Leprous, Magister of the Klavekian Academie of Magical Arts, came forth with a solution for at least part of the problem. He invented the famous Blank Staffs, magical tools to not only explore foreign magic, but to steal its secrets to a degree. When a spellcaster is hit with a Blank Staff she loses a prepared spell to it. The owner of the Blank Staff can then use the stolen spell. Strangely, when the user of a Blank Staff would be able to cast the stolen spell on its own, the magic vanished, but leaving the Blank Staff rechargeable once more. In the times when the Blank Staff was invented, those magic has not vanished at all, but been transferred to Tarissov the Leprous himself, who in this way became mightier and mightier. Finally, he felt strong enough to challenge the tsar himself, but he overestimated his abilities and was finally slain after what is known as the War Without Faces. Where the magic of a Blank Staffs vanishes now is uncertain, some speculate that Tarissov the Leprous isn’t dead at all, still accumulating power, other say the magic simply dripples away.</p><p>The magic needed to create Blank Staffs went to the grave with Tarissov the Leprous and is lost. But since the traitor-magician wanted the Blank Staffs to be spread wide he produced great amounts of them and sold them cheaply in what was viewed as a patriotic act those days. The Blank Staffs aren’t cheap anymore, but still readily available on the Magical Fair, charged or uncharged. Buyers have to beware though, there are Blank Staffs staffs with magic in them that no one can use, since the user has to be able to understand the magic in the staff on principle. An arcane specialist can’t used a stolen divine spell. The Vikmordere do have something entirely different sometimes, the so called mosaic magic. Only rarely are staffs with mosaic magic useable by any non-Vikmordere in Klavek.</p><h2>Empty Staffs</h2><p>While the magic to create @UUID[.1hMoSKS1OqlchIwq#the-blank-staffs]{Blank Staffs} is lost, the general art of staffbinding has made strides in @UUID[.ulLkhApELbg08M4o]{Klavek}. In these days it is possible to create staffs that are empty in their own ways. The procedure of creating them is expensive and time consuming, but also very flexible. The exact method is a guarded secret of the Klavekian Academie of Magical Arts, but the effect is, when a buyer wants a specific staff, he has to pay an extra amount of money equal 20%, but gets his staff in but 24 hours, for the raw Empty Staff had been prepared in advance. Since other nations still use methods that take a hundred days to produce an individual staff, Klavek’s magicians have a sharp competitive edge in emergencies or with clients not known for their patience. On the other hand, the Magical Fair is known to have most common staffs readily available to buy at normal costs if one spends some time searching, so Empty Staffs would usually be only required for exotic or rare inventions if it was just a matter of speed. With a successful DC 15 Spellcraft check the Empty Staff can be filled with additional magic for the usual fees (and 20%) by a skilled staffweaver, though a failed check makes the Empty Staff unusable for a full moon circle (a month). Empty Staffs are used for Bonded Objects or by wizards who don’t want to use an Efficient Quiver to sort through their magical staffs.</p><h2>Two Staff Weaving</h2><p>Klavekian spellcasters have perfected the art of fighting with staffs since Tarissov the Leprous days. Lukov the Fencer was the first magician to invent the art of Two Wand Weaving, and this feat is still popular in modern Klavek.</p></div>","markdown":""},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"sort":900000,"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}},{"name":"Lineage of Klavekian Tsars","type":"text","_id":"T3yjCTV19TztrWUu","title":{"show":false,"level":1},"image":{},"text":{"format":1,"content":"<div class=\"aventyr\"><p class=\"s5\">Lineage of Klavekian Tsars</p><ul><li><p><strong>About -520-490:</strong> Years of the Angry Sea, the Kraken terrorizes the eastern shores of what is today’s modern @UUID[.ulLkhApELbg08M4o]{Klavek}</p></li><li><p><strong>About -500:</strong> @UUID[.dwAJ5Jtc6ii8zQoh]{Mohkba} founded by Prince Yuri Dvagaslov, the Holy Knight of the Crossroad. @UUID[.LGCNFtJ4cWlq0HjE#divine-quarter]{The Sophianeum }is built in Mohkba, or, by a different account, the city is built where the Sophianeum already stood.

From charging unheard of (and obscenely high) “docking fees,” “cargo fees,” or “passenger fees,” that money goes straight into Casta’s pocket. Although there have been numerous complaints to Marshall Mulcahey, Casta has a complex system of how the docks are run that no one else understands and Tatiana came to the conclusion that hiring a new dockmaster and untangling everything at the docks would end up costing more than the town can afford, so she allows Casta to charge these fees, but talks with him occasionally about making sure some of those funds make their way to the city coffers.</p>\n<h2>Torrent</h2>\n<p><strong>Alignment and Type:</strong> True Neutral small town</p>\n<p><strong>Modifiers Crime:</strong> +1, Law -3, Lore +1, Society +4</p>\n<p><strong>Qualities:</strong> Academic, Notorious</p>\n<p><strong>Danger:</strong> 10</p>\n<p><strong>Disadvantages:</strong> –</p>\n<p><strong>Government:</strong> Magical</p>\n<p><strong>Population:</strong> 275</p>\n<p><strong>Notable NPCs:</strong> Matron Elizabeth Dunleavy, Daughter of Nature (CN, female, Klavek (human), Druid 11), Yugorg Daemonbreaker, Jailor (LN, male, ogre, Fighter 6)</p>\n<p><strong>Base Value and Purchase Limit:</strong> 1,300/7,500</p>\n<p><strong>Spellcasting:</strong> 6th</p>\n<p><strong>Minor Items</strong> 3d4; <strong>Medium Items</strong> 1d6; <strong>Major Items</strong> –</p>\n<p>Torrent, named for the increase in the speed of the where the two rivers join, is the “middle child” of the Three Sisters.

Separated from the other nations by the blasted deserts of the North, and the cliffsides overlooking the ocean to their East, the outside interferences within their growing culture were few and far in between. Developing a spiritual belief system that relies heavily upon the animal spirits around them, as well as the spirits of the moon and sun, and heavily practicing human sacrifice, the N’rcul experienced a true miracle, when, following the passing of a beloved ruler, their leader returned from the grave, restored to life, stronger and filled with the power of the spirits themselves. Kham-a-Tael rose from the grave ignorant of the world outside of his lands, knowing no more of the mysteries of the world then his people, and truly believed that he and only he had been chosen to return from the other side by the spirits, as a sign to his people, a sign that the spirits are listening, and they are watching.</p>\n<p>Kham-a-Tael’s rising sparked a religious fervor within his people, a renewed strength within the nations under his name, and renewed hope for the future of these lands. It was into these lands that a pair of undead were drawn, sensing the power of a newly awakened, and extremely powerful, undead, an unlikely pair of traveling companions (The Vampire Davional, and the @UUID[.mALZCj1Avtm347FY]{Lich Malakittal}). Presenting himself to The Risen Lord within his sleeping chambers, Davional set about establishing nightly visits with the curious undead lord, building a rapport, staying only long enough each night to make sure the interest was there, until the two had gotten familiar enough with each other that the talks got lengthier and lengthier, building to the point that Davional and Malakittal were given rooms within the temples to better accommodate them. It was through these late night conversations that Davional began to educate Kham-a-Tael as to what he believed him to be (a mummy), and several of the abilities demonstrated by Kham-a-Tael supported the theories of the cunning vampire.</p>\n<p>It was within these conversations that Davional laid the seeds for Kham-a-Tael’s mistrust of the outside world, and allowing outsiders to know of the miracle of his rebirth, and in friendship offered to both Davional and his companion Malakittal a permanent place of safety within his lands as well. Davional, realizing the possibility, took the offer a step further, and countered the offer with a safe means of utilizing the resources of the lands to make both his own and Kham-aTael’s people profitable, while guaranteeing that outside influences would be kept at bay. Davional offered to take the edges of NaeraCull for his own people, the Wandering Nation, forming a living buffer between the N’rcul and the outside world, and begin setting up trade with other nations and consortium’s for the natural resources of the rainforest, with the people’s of the wandering nation and the N’rcul supplying the work force, splitting labor between the materials being harvested. Convincing the Risen Lord that it was only a matter of time before a force to large to repel would arrive and begin harvesting resources against their will, it was only logical that they preemptively set up trade relations of their own. All connections were made from Davional’s people, and work began immediately on gathering the Wandering Nation and building them a home to call their own, as well as setting up mining sites, harvesting camps, and farms to utilize local fauna such as the cacao and several other rare herbs.</p>\n<p>Of all the materials available however, the desert offered up the strangest, in the form of raw glass. The deserts of NaeraCull lie within the path of the Scorched Lands, and as such are subjected to temperatures that fuse dunes of sand into glass on a regular basis. Organizing a workforce comprised of constructs, golems and undead all under the watchful eye of a handful of trusted subservient necromancers, Davional has turned the harvesting and export of glass into an extremely lucrative enterprise.</p>\n</div>","markdown":""},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{"core":{"sheetClass":""}}},{"sort":200000,"name":"Malakittal","type":"text","_id":"mALZCj1Avtm347FY","title":{"show":false,"level":1},"image":{},"text":{"format":1,"content":"<div class=\"aventyr\">\n<p class=\"s5\">Malakittal</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center\"><strong>Malakittal, the shadow behind the thrones</strong></p>\n<p> </p>\n<img style=\"float:right;margin:0px 15px 15px 0px;border:0px\" src=\"modules/aaw-games-aventyr/Setting-images/Malekittal-272x300.webp\" width=\"272\" height=\"300\" />\n<p>The Lich who had no desire to be, Malakittal was a cruel and selfish child, gifted with an abnormal intellect amongst his peers, but a complete lack of social grace. Sold into apprenticeship to an older wizard, Malakittal’s father was more than happy to watch his son disappear over the horizon. It was that devalued concept that hardened the heart and soul of the boy who would, within the next year, poison and slay his mentor, and flee into the night with a collection of his tomes. Hiding in the underbelly of a city is an even easier thing to do when you have magical tricks at your disposal to trade with the local guild, and Malakittal soon found himself a means to get by while he studied. At least until the first time he lost control of a spell he was attempting to to cast, and it cost the life of a valued guild member. strung up and disemboweled, left to die, all should have ended in lonely violence for Malakittal, but such was not to be the case.</p>\n<p>Upon piercing the veil, and casting his gaze upon the first realms of death, as his life left his body, terror tore through the young man’s frame, for there was his arcane master, like a rabid dog, at the end of a chain held by a terrifying Demonic being. With the last breaths of life did Malakittal learn that he had interfered with a demonic pact, and had left his former teacher unable to uphold his end of the deal. Seeing no value yet within Malakittal, the Demon trapped his soul, binding it within a crystal prison, and used his foul magics to force lichdom upon what was left of the young man’s body. Sent back amongst the living, a thing of undeath and fear, Malakittal fled the city, and went even further into hiding. Several hundred years passed between that night in that back city alley, and the night everything would change for ever in the “life” of Malakittal. The night he met Davional.</p>\n<p>Davional was merely looking for a place to wait out the passing of a caravan. Transporting several relics from one temple to another, this caravan had enlisted the aid of a full contingent of Templars and a handful of Paladins, seeking to guarantee the safe arrival of their cargo. It was enough of a threat that Davional, a vampire with several generations of age to his name, felt it better to seek a deeper shelter until they had left his lands, rather than risk discovery and be forced to defend himself. It was this need for a deeper tomb that led the two unlikely friends to first meet, the charismatic vampire, and the antisocial lich. Davional, being ever the opportunist, recognized the power within his grasp, and manipulated the lich expertly, taking full advantage of his lack of social grace or experience, to earn the friendship and loyalty of this powerful being hiding from the world.</p>\n<p>Malakittal has been the shadow behind Davional ever since. When Davional relocated his people (the Wandering Nation) to NaeraCull, it was on the promise to Malakittal that the temperate environment would be good for him, and provide more opportunities to learn new arcane secrets. Establishing themselves within a land ripe with the cultural acceptance of human sacrifice has turned out to be of great amusement to Malakittal, as there is never a shortage of souls wishing to “aid” him in his research.</p>\n</div>","markdown":""},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{"core":{"sheetClass":""}}},{"sort":300000,"name":"The Dralman Documents","type":"text","_id":"Cxr0Se9MxlOrH7Ne","title":{"show":false,"level":1},"image":{},"text":{"format":1,"content":"<div class=\"aventyr\"><p class=\"s5\">The Dralman Documents</p><p></p><p>A skald of some renown, Theo Dralman was quested by the Grand University of @UUID[JournalEntry.QVrlu0lTv2vFtT5P.JournalEntryPage.dwAJ5Jtc6ii8zQoh]{Mohkba} to enter the dark jungle and learn all he could of the spirits to which the native people prayed, and how the @UUID[JournalEntry.QVrlu0lTv2vFtT5P]{Klavek Kingdom} could use this information to its own end.

For many species, Obri<strong> </strong>and Obor<strong> </strong>are interchangeable, despite the differences in meaning.</p>\n<h3>Definicni Obor</h3>\n<p><strong>Definicni Obor</strong> – meaning values that define giants. It is a divine position, one taken by a member of the clerical council. Although clan leaders are usually member of the <strong>@UUID[.bUzRK3wWLJPr3eIJ#obrovsky]{Obrovsky}</strong>, they frequently take advice from the members of this group.</p>\n<h3>Maakarioborkauppias</h3>\n<p><strong>Maakarioborkauppias</strong> – meaning “the makers and sellers of giant goods”; all trades belong to this group. It covers all known Crafts, from the most basic wooden utensils to the most complex of locks and traps, and Professions. Within towns and cities, guilds may exist if 10 or more inhabitants are involved in the same activity, but if asked which group they belong to by someone else, a craftsperson or giant of a particular profession will state, “Maakarioborkauppias.”</p>\n<h3>Maatilaoborllinen</h3>\n<p><strong>Maatilaoborllinen</strong> – meaning “owner of the giant lands” and the title used by those who farm or cultivate the agricultural areas of Obor.

It is an arcane position, one taken by a member of the wizard amalgamation or sorcerer collective. They frequently live slightly isolated lives as their magic can be unpredictable.</p>\n<h3>Obrovsky</h3>\n<p><strong>Obrovsky</strong> – meaning “of the giants”. It is a military position, usually populated by fighters, paladins and barbarians of all types and alignments, which can cause conflict of a deadly nature.

As a language, it can clearly be traced back to Abyssal, Celestial and Infernal roots and is a primordial language.</p><p>Individual @UUID[.YvplRrSOlzeMa3MI#societies]{societal} and @UUID[.YvplRrSOlzeMa3MI#sub-types]{sub-type} dialects and variations are as follows:</p><h2><span id=\"Societies\">Societies</span></h2><h3>Votunobri</h3><p><strong>Votunobri</strong> – the basic language of all giants. Anyone who can speak this can communicate with any creature that is able to speak “Giant”. When most creatures say they can speak “giant”, this is usually the language they mean. However, in terms of complexity, it is a little like a child talking to an adult and giants often chuckle at the lack of sophistication and understanding of what is being said.</p><h3>Votunmenot</h3><p><strong>Votunmenot</strong> – ceremonial language used by all officials, but particularly the <strong>@UUID[.bUzRK3wWLJPr3eIJ#viceoborovy]{Viceoborovy}</strong>. Complex and enormously descriptive at times, it is punctuated by individual words which sum up what may have just taken 20 minutes to describe. It has a great deal in common with the language spoken by treants, which is another language which can be traced back to primordial times.</p><h3>Votunmyymme</h3><p><strong>Votunmyymme</strong> – the trade dialect of the <strong>@UUID[.bUzRK3wWLJPr3eIJ#maakarioborkauppias]{Maakarioborkauppias}</strong>, indicating that the giant itself, or an item made by the giant, is for sale. The dialect consistently suggests “we sell” as a group rather than individualizing any particular activity, reflecting the belief that all crafts and professions rely on each other to be successful.</p><h3>Votunruoka</h3><p><strong>Votunruoka</strong> – the group dialect of the <strong>@UUID[.bUzRK3wWLJPr3eIJ#maatilaoborllinen]{Maatilaoborllinen}</strong>, indicating that the group feeds giantkind, both in terms of providing raw food and cooked meals. It is another basic dialect that leaves little room for misunderstanding or use elsewhere. Giant druids use a form of this dialect.</p><h3>Votunsota</h3><p><strong>Votunsota </strong>–<strong> </strong>language used by the <strong>@UUID[.bUzRK3wWLJPr3eIJ#obrovsky]{Obrovsky}</strong>, full of martial phrases and strident exclamations as well as sections dealing specifically with might, power, arms and armor and battle tactics. It is a relatively straightforward language that can be used without confusion on a battlefield and doesn’t suffer from a possible misunderstanding in meaning when passed along a chain of command. It is at all times a practical and effective dialect.</p><h3>Votuntaika</h3><p><strong>Votuntaika</strong> – language used by the <strong>@UUID[.bUzRK3wWLJPr3eIJ#mezioborovy]{Mezioborovy}</strong>. Full or mysterious and arcane phrasing, it has elements of Draconic entwined within it. There are a number of mythical and legendary words of power within <strong>@UUID[.YvplRrSOlzeMa3MI#votuntaika]{Votuntaika}</strong> which act like metamagic feats when sufficiently understood and practiced, although these seem to only work for giants able to wield arcane power of some significance.</p><h3>Votunuskonto</h3><p><strong>@UUID[.YvplRrSOlzeMa3MI#votunuskonto]{Votunuskonto}</strong> – language used by the <strong>@UUID[.bUzRK3wWLJPr3eIJ#definicni-obor]{Definicni Obor}</strong>. As the language of religion, philosophy and guidance, it has to be clear and exact at all times. All texts and statements which deal with matters of the gods and the ways of giant life are now all recorded in <strong>@UUID[.YvplRrSOlzeMa3MI#votunuskonto]{Votunuskonto}</strong>, as well as the language they were originally received in. This has made the language a powerful tool in dictating the path the giants will take, as it links together the dictates of the gods over time.</p><h2><span id=\"Sub-types\">Sub-types</span></h2><h3><strong>Votunjatti</strong></h3><p><strong>Votunjatti</strong> – spoken by the @UUID[.0ru8kn3zml6fAvTq#athach]{Athach}. Whilst it is recognized by all Obri that athachs are actually aberrations, they are considered the Children of the Gods (see @UUID[.0ru8kn3zml6fAvTq#athach]{athach entry}). <strong>Votunjatti</strong> is even more simplistic than <strong>@UUID[.YvplRrSOlzeMa3MI#votunobri]{Votunobri}</strong>, a straightforward version that athachs have slipped into over the millennia. Some sages moot that it is in fact the gods’ original attempt at a language for a mortal creature (and that athachs are the first attempt at giants), an idea that is closely studied and debated.</p><h3><strong>Votunpilvi</strong></h3><p><strong>Votunpilvi</strong> – spoken by the @UUID[.0ru8kn3zml6fAvTq#cloud]{Cloud giants}. Although these giants have universally deep voices, the tone and flow of their dialect ranges between dark and brooding all the way to high and wispy, just as clouds themselves. Occasionally used by bards for songs and tales of attempts to take hold of the unobtainable.</p><h3><strong>Votuntupla</strong></h3><p><strong>Votuntupla</strong> – spoken by the @UUID[.0ru8kn3zml6fAvTq#ettin]{Ettins}. It is an odd dialect, one that is made up of repetition, double explanation or statement and sometimes cross purpose, particularly when arguments are taking place. It is (correctly) thought that the two heads of an ettin can each only speak part of their overall language capability and that if an ettin was to lose one head yet survive, they would find it very hard to communicate verbally.</p><h3><strong>Votunpalo</strong></h3><p><strong>Votunpalo</strong> – spoken by the @UUID[.0ru8kn3zml6fAvTq#fire]{Fire giants}, the dialect is, naturally, a fiery one, fully of inflammatory delivery and passionate appeals. It is a dialect that lends itself most easily to arguments and energetic activity. Many giants who wish to motivate those around them who make things include a smattering of this dialect.</p><h3><strong>Votunkuura/Votunhuurre</strong></h3><p><strong>Votunkuura/Votunhuurre </strong>– spoken by the @UUID[.0ru8kn3zml6fAvTq#frost]{Frost giants}, <strong>Votunkuura</strong> is a dialect with a significant number of clicking and cracking sounds in addition to actual words. <strong>Vutunhuurre</strong> is a little more delicate and is most frequently used to describe the lands within 100 miles of a frost giant’s home, particularly when discussing details of the natural environment.</p><h3><strong>Votunkunnas</strong></h3><p><strong>Votunkunnas </strong>– spoken by the @UUID[.0ru8kn3zml6fAvTq#hill]{Hill giants}. Like the hills themselves, the dialect is one that rolls, with noticeable peaks and troughs in delivery. It has a range of words to describe fertile land and is sometimes used by those in the druid circle to get complex points across to those knowledgeable about giants.</p><h3><strong>Votunmakeanveden</strong></h3><p><strong>Votunmakeanveden </strong>–<strong> </strong>spoken by the @UUID[.0ru8kn3zml6fAvTq#merrow]{Merrow}. It is a guttural dialect, full of liquid sounds and use of air bubbles in the throat. Not an easy dialect to get to grips with for those who do not speak Aquan.</p><h3><strong>Votunkaaos</strong></h3><p><strong>Votunkaaos </strong>– spoken by the @UUID[.0ru8kn3zml6fAvTq#ogres]{Ogres}. A highly-changeable, ever-adapting dialect that readily picks up words and phrases from other languages and, if spoken for relatively short periods in lands where other humanoids dwell, will morph into a good approximation of that land’s natives’ language.</p><h3><strong>Votunkivi</strong></h3><p><strong>Votunkivi </strong>– spoken by the @UUID[.0ru8kn3zml6fAvTq#stone]{Stone giants}, full of rumbles and grinding notes. Elders use a variation called <strong>Votunjalokivi</strong> when communing with the earth. Although it has close links to Terran, there are no recorded cases of non-stone giant elders being able to speak the dialect.</p><h3><strong>Votunmyrsky</strong></h3><p><strong>Votunmyrsky </strong>– spoken by the @UUID[.0ru8kn3zml6fAvTq#storm]{Storm giants}, it is an all-or-nothing dialect, sounding either at complete calm or alarmingly strident, even when being used, for example, to tell jokes.</p><h3><strong>Votunparantaa</strong></h3><p><strong>Votunparantaa </strong>– spoken by the @UUID[.0ru8kn3zml6fAvTq#trolls]{Trolls}, it is a dialect which can talk endlessly about any topic, given the chance. It folds back in on itself and develops and grows in a seemingly unstoppable way.</p><h3><strong>Votunalamaailma</strong></h3><p><strong>Votunalamaailma </strong>– spoken by the @UUID[.0ru8kn3zml6fAvTq#underworld]{underworld giants}, this dialect is frequently more easily used and understood by Underworld dwellers than other giants when first encountered. If listened to for a week, it becomes clear that it contains much that any other giant does actually understand but is a dark and shadowy version of Votun.</p><p>It is not known if there are any other languages or dialects used elsewhere by yet-to-be-encountered giant types. However, giant language and dialect is so heavily influenced by the land within which users live, particularly in delivery, that if giants do live in swamps, deserts or jungles, then it is more than likely that their dialect will have many components strongly influenced by those natural surroundings, such as the soft, shifting sounds of moving desert sands or dripping, lush noises of a tropical jungle.</p><p> </p></div>","markdown":""},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{"core":{"sheetClass":"core.JournalTextPageSheet"}}},{"sort":300000,"name":"Religion","type":"text","_id":"eSZclzdgw0E9gdK6","title":{"show":false,"level":1},"image":{},"text":{"format":1,"content":"<div class=\"aventyr\"><p class=\"s5\">Religion</p><p>The basis of all giant religion is called Vodoun. It is a traditional animistic religion; Vodoun origin, history and evolution centres around the vodoun spirits and other elements of divine and arcane essences that govern the Obor, a hierarchy that range in power from major deities governing the forces of nature and giant society to the spirits of individual streams, trees, and rocks, as well as dozens of ethnic vodoun spirits, defenders of a certain clan, tribe, or region as well as the nation as a whole.</p><p>The vodoun spirits are the centre of religious life, which is structured around doctrines such as the interaction of spirits (which usually manifest as angels, demons and devils) with living giants. A single adult giant is often a physical equal, if not superior, to an angel, demon or devil, so such interactions aren’t to be feared, more to be learned from.</p><p>Adherents also emphasise ancestor worship and hold that the spirits of the dead live side by side with the world of the living, each family of spirits having its own clearly-stated priesthood, sometimes hereditary, when the clerical or druidic responsibility is passed from parent to appropriate blood child.</p><p>Patterns of worship follow various dialects, gods, practices, songs and rituals. Vodoun recognises two overseeing creator deities with many lesser spirits called @UUID[.eSZclzdgw0E9gdK6#the-apulainen]{Apulainen (Helpers)}. The two creators, one divine and one arcane, called Pappi and Salainen respectively, are androgynous beings who combined to bear thirteen children. These children became the principal Apulainen spirits and Pappi and Salainen gave each rule over a realm of Obor.</p><p>The creators embody a dual principle of light and dark, in which Pappi represents light and the sun whilst Salainen represents darkness and the moon. Each aspect has good and bad points and is considered in positive and negative ways at different times for different reasons.</p><p>Of the thirteen children, twelve are still worshipped today. Each child, all also androgynous beings, now represents one of the twelve remaining giant types that live in Obor. Each giant type is loyal to their patron Apulainen, but gives praise and collection to Pappi and Salainen on appropriate days as well as to the lesser Apulainen of the society, clan and tribe they belong to, and to their own family spirits.</p><p>The thirteenth Apulainen represented the titans, who left Obor to travel the planes many millennia ago. They are no longer considered to be part of giantkind and are rarely referred to. It is considered to be extremely rude to talk of titans with any giant.</p><p>All creation is considered both divine and arcane, and therefore everything contains the power of both of these forces. This is how medicines such as herbal remedies are understood, and explains the casual use of mundane objects in religious ritual. Vodoun talismans, called “fetishes”, are objects such as statues, dried animal parts or manufactured items that are used for their healing and spiritually rejuvenating properties.</p><p>The @UUID[.bUzRK3wWLJPr3eIJ#definicni-obor]{Definicni Obor} and @UUID[.bUzRK3wWLJPr3eIJ#mezioborovy]{Mezioborovy }are entrusted to cast spells on or at enemies on behalf of supplicants, either calling upon vodoun spirits to bring misfortune or harm to a person or group or/and benefit to the supplicant. Sacrifice is a common way to show respect and thankfulness to the gods, usually consisting of something that has taken time, effort and energy to personally produce. Value is of secondary importance to these three factors.</p><p>Pappi and Salainen’s youngest child, @UUID[.eSZclzdgw0E9gdK6#ogres-–-kuopus]{Kuopus}, remains to this day in Obor and acts as a go-between with their other children; it is the principal Apulainen of the @UUID[.0ru8kn3zml6fAvTq#ogres]{ogres} and appears as either a young and virile female when something needs to be done urgently or takes the form of an old man when something needs to be learned and time is available.</p><p>The other chief Apulainen are listed below. After these principal Apulainen, there comes an entire range of lesser and least spirits. The most visible and easily recognised of these is Airut, a messenger spirit who relays messages between the giant world and the world of the Apulainen. It almost always takes the form of a dark, squat giant with a large bag over its shoulder and a pipe in its mouth. As the mediator between the gods and the living Airut maintains balance, order, peace and communication. Airut’s Pipe is able to cast spells and act as a weapon as it can transform into a two-handed hammer as a free action.</p><p>The principal Apulainen of the twelve giant types in Obor are listed below. Each can appear as a male or female as it chooses, or in its natural androgynous form. Each change is usually a free action that doesn’t provoke an attack of opportunity if undertaken in a situation where it is threatened.</p><p>The forms come complete with any clothing, armour and equipment the Apulainen choose to be wearing and carrying at that point. No item worn by an Apulainen remains if it chooses to leave Obor or if it is dismissed or banished. However, it is able to bring specific items to give to giants for a purpose.</p><p></p><h2>The Apulainen</h2><h3>Athach – Ennen</h3><p>Ennen appears as a five-limbed creature that chooses whichever configuration of limbs is most beneficial at that moment in time. It can change up to three limbs as a free action, but changing four or five is a move equivalent action. Although it mostly appears as either a male or female @UUID[.0ru8kn3zml6fAvTq#athach]{athach}, it can also appear as any four-legged beast that resides in Obor but have an arm sprouting from the middle of its back. Alternatively Ennen will walk amongst the athach as a rogue that is particularly dexterous, and attempt to get them to think about solutions to problems that don’t always involve brute strength.</p><h3>Cloud – Ylla</h3><p>Ylla will appear amongst the @UUID[.0ru8kn3zml6fAvTq#cloud]{cloud giants} as a male hunter with huskies or a female bard telling tales of lost souls. In both cases the form is neither particularly striking nor overly plain; it is in its actions that Ylla makes its point. It will also appear as a spectacular display of lenticular clouds over important events, either causing fear in the enemy or providing cover for attackers if required. Ylla will sometimes be found in the company of @UUID[.eSZclzdgw0E9gdK6#storm-–-salama]{Salama}, particularly when the latter is in dragon form, in a cloud form that confounds Salama’s abilities, allow each of them to hone their skills.</p><h3>Ettin – Kaksois</h3><p>Kaksois can appear as a martial-looking male or female @UUID[.0ru8kn3zml6fAvTq#ettin]{ettin} when it wishes to walk amongst its children. It can also appear as twins that are barely distinguishable from their faces but are clearly one male and one female if viewed in their entirety. The ettin forms are experienced and at their prime, whilst the twins are youngsters looking to gain help from the ettins and are a test of their tolerance and wisdom. Kaksois will occasionally appear as a sage, able to see both sides of an issue, and will mediate on a disagreement that hinders progress, whether of an individual ettin or the whole race.</p><h3>Fire – Hotkia</h3><p>Hotkia will appear as a burning fire giant to its followers, either a female cleric or male “paladin”, both of which will look to lead the @UUID[.0ru8kn3zml6fAvTq#fire]{fire giants} it has visited to greater glory. Hotkia will also appear as ceremonial fire at events where such is in place, which is just about every event you can think of that involves fire giants. The flames will be the purest red that any fire giant has seen, with the heat being a cleansing rather than damaging experience.</p><h3>Frost – Valkoinen</h3><p>Valkoinen chooses to appear either as a female ranger out to accompany those who face peril alone or as a monk accompanying travellers and asking them to test themselves as a group, perhaps to complete tasks they never imagined they would face. Valkoinen will also appear as snow fall where every flake is the same or as a layer of frost where every crystal is identical. In either case, it takes a cleric of Valkoinen 2d6 rounds to spot this, a follower [[/roll 2d4]] minutes and anyone with knowledge of giants [[/roll 5d6]] minutes. Once the snow or frost has finished falling ([[/roll 3d2]] hours), it will rise up into Valkoinen’s androgynous form and consider answering requests.</p><h3>Hill – Lehti</h3><p>Lehti appears either as a druid or as a barbarian, male or female. In any of these forms, Lehti is quite young, and always younger than the @UUID[.0ru8kn3zml6fAvTq#hill]{hill giant} it is appearing before. It will often offer to act as a helper for an individual hill giant going about an important or necessary task, slowly showing a more effective or efficient way of completing that task. Only when the task is complete and the hill giant concerned has thanked its new young friend will Lehti reveal itself in its true form, a cross between a hill giant and a treant, although much more like the former.</p><h3>Merrow – Jokijarvi</h3><p>Jokijarvi tends to present an appearance that is overwhelming: as a colossal elder water elemental, engulfing island-size patch of sentient seaweed, or a colossal kraken. It is even said that the great lake serpents are a taken form. At other times, Jokijarvi will walk amongst the @UUID[.0ru8kn3zml6fAvTq#merrow]{merrow} as a cleric, or very occasionally sorcerer. The merrow aren’t known for their spell casting ability, and every now and then Jokijarvi will conduct an “enlightenment drive” to ensure knowledge is spread by more merrow than shamen and tribal elders. These drives involve finding up to a dozen young merrow and providing the “Mark of All Merrow,” a birthmark that actually taps into innate spell casting ability and brings it forth.</p><h3>Ogres – Kuopus</h3><p>Kuopus is generally happy to let the image of @UUID[.0ru8kn3zml6fAvTq#ogres]{ogres} as crude boors ride, because it means they have to learn to stand on their own two feet and be rewarded by a distinct place in the world. Taking the typical barbarian form of the ogres, Kuopus encourages robust tournaments designed to let the cream of the ogres rise to the top, even as the god appears as an old man. But at other times, Kuopus walks amongst the ogres as the most charming and eloquent of their type, encouraging a self-expression that is usually held in almost brutal check. Often female, but not exclusively, Kuopus appears as a bard or story-telling illusionist, and revels that the ogres throw themselves whole-heartedly into can last for weeks. These revels encourage the often down-trodden ogres to face a world that despises them with renewed vigour. Kuopus is also the go-between for the other gods.</p><h3>Stone – Paasi</h3><p>The @UUID[.0ru8kn3zml6fAvTq#stone]{stone giant} people rarely see Passi, but they know their god is amongst them at all times. Passi IS stone, and has adopted the stone giants because of their affinity with the material, and is present as the mountains and lands the giants live on, work with, and use as tools, homes and weapons. If Passi does appear in a clearly recognisable form, it is as a travelling elder at a moot, or as an expert in some problem, stepping in to advise and guide, but never tell, a stone giant council or individual how to move on from an issue OR not make a mistake through a particular curse of action. Occasionally Passi will take the form of an ideal earth elemental from the dreams of stone giant children, although this is really just a slight variation in Passi’s usual form of stone itself.</p><h3>Storm – Salama</h3><p>Salama is a slightly contrary god, usually appearing as the opposite of the @UUID[.0ru8kn3zml6fAvTq#storm]{storm giant} who receives a visit. A heavily-armed fighter will see Salama as a robed monk, a wandering ranger sees a desk-bound mage or sage, an aristocrat sees a commoner, males see a female, and so on. Salama enjoys changing perception as much as the weather, and will present a form that encourages introspection and then release of hidden talents and unexpected innate abilities. If angry, Salama appears as a force dragon of a size sufficient to frighten whoever is the annoyance into an apology; all storm giant tales relate that Salama has never killed anyone or anything in this form, preferring to humiliate them and leave them bereft of all belongings and dignity. However, those tales also say that if Salama does kill someone when in dragon form, it will herald the end of the world. Salama is sometimes found with Ylla, who provides a worthy sparring partner for Salama’s force dragon form.</p><h3>Trolls – Oliivi</h3><p>Oliivi was once a simple @UUID[.0ru8kn3zml6fAvTq#trolls]{troll}, just like those walk Obor to this day. The difference between Oliivi and the trolls that came before is that the now-god found a way to channel the chaos and evil that trolls live by into unifying forces. Oliivi is actually responsible for introducing the isolationist views that all giants now hold, encouraging trolls to use their chaotic ways to promote troll clans over all others, and their evil approach to ensure troll elite were able to come out on top in any situation. Today, Oliivi will appear amongst the trolls as a ranger or druid of either sex, often when a tribe has fallen to ways that are too chaotic or too evil; after appearing out of seemingly nowhere, Oliivi will once again show that the way for trolls to succeed is to channel their natural instincts outwards onto others, not onto each other. This is a never-ending task</p><h3>Underworld – Maan–Uumenissa</h3><p>Little is known about Maan-Uumenissa, even by the @UUID[.0ru8kn3zml6fAvTq#underworld]{underworld giants} themselves. Stories say that the god bears the weight of the entire world at all times, and that providing places for the underworld giants to live and thrive is enough to give thanks for. Maan-Uumenissa is actually currently in torpor; when the world was struck by the “Shard of the Sun”, the carnage it caused (such as the Scarred Lands) struck the god deeply, and now Maan-Uumenissa rests to heal wounds that have damaged an entire planet. The god does visit the underworld giants on very rare occasions, usually as the ghost a mage who concentrates on spells associated with stone and force, or as the spirit of an expert stone mason able to carve a place to live from the solid mass of the Underworld. It is rumoured some @UUID[JournalEntry.QlctNkzE9injOde9.JournalEntryPage.t4LZuyNruvzneOHD]{deep dwarves} also worship Maan–Uumenissa, tapping into the god’s ability to work with stone to create particularly spiritual places far below the surface of Obor. If an alliance of these dwarves and giants ever occurs, other races will almost certainly find themselves out of a home.</p><p></p></div>","markdown":""},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}},{"sort":400000,"name":"Race History","type":"text","_id":"0ru8kn3zml6fAvTq","title":{"show":false,"level":1},"image":{},"text":{"format":1,"content":"<div class=\"aventyr\"><p class=\"s5\">Race History</p><h2>Athach</h2><p>Athach – The athach people came about as a result of <em>Pappi</em> and <em>Salainen</em> gathering together all the children of the other giant races that didn’t quite match the ideal they had in mind for them. They saw the advantage of a race that confounded belief, both within Obor and without, and ensured the newly-named athach race survived and, in its own way, flourished, with <em>@UUID[.eSZclzdgw0E9gdK6#athach-–-ennen]{Ennen}</em> charged to watch over it. To this day, the athach view themselves as special and chosen, but this knowledge is often enough to drive them to the brink of madness.</p><p><strong>Leader: </strong>Kolme Kadet - 5th level bard, 5th level fighter (Cha 13)</p><h2>Cloud</h2><p>Cloud – The cloud giants came into being from the very air, as <em>@UUID[.eSZclzdgw0E9gdK6#cloud-–-ylla]{Ylla}</em>, drew air, earth, fire and water together and moulded them into the clouds. To this day, cloud giants are able to show how each of the four elements are part of their “whole”, and explain why this sum is greater than the individual elemental parts. At their death, the most venerated cloud giants are afforded a ceremony which ensures their bodies are returned to the four elements in equal parts, so they can influence the very being of future members of the race.</p><p><strong>Leader: </strong>Tupruta Kevyt 12th level cleric</p><h2>Ettin</h2><p>Ettin – Ettin tales relate that when they were created, their maker <em>@UUID[.eSZclzdgw0E9gdK6#ettin-–-kaksois]{Kaksois }</em>had so much for them to say and do that two heads were necessary in order to achieve all that was required of them. Unfortunately, <em>Kaksois</em> failed to give any indication which head was in charge and so discord is as frequent a visitor as harmony. It is also said that if the two heads of a single ettin ever achieve complete agreement on every matter for the duration of a full moon, ettins everywhere will rise to lead the Obri nation in a wise and benevolent way.</p><p><strong>Leader: </strong>Kaksikko Paa 13th level fighter</p><h2>Fire</h2><p>Fire – Fire giants originally consisted of outcasts from all other societies, hotheads and rabble-rousers who drove others to despair before finding themselves permanently banished in order to save everyone else’s sanity. Many retreated from the land that was known, taking to the depths and lost places away from the hills and mountains that giants were used to living in. <em>@UUID[.eSZclzdgw0E9gdK6#fire-–-hotkia]{Hotkia}</em> is talked of as if the god actually walked amongst the earliest outcasts, leading them to the fiery rifts and heights that others ignored. These travels took the nomads to <em>Aitotulivuori</em>, the largest, most internally-active volcano in Obor. From here the fire giant tribes and clans grew, descending deep into the earth at the same time. Eventually a rift to the Elemental Plane of Fire was discovered, and the identity of the fire giants properly established.</p><p><strong>Leader: </strong>Palo Halko 6th level expert, 6th level warrior</p><h2>Frost</h2><p>Frost – The frost giants hold that they were the first giants, when <em>Pappi</em> and <em>Salainen</em> took it upon themselves to count the flakes of snow that fell on the ring of mountains far to the north of what is now Obor. As they landed, each became a giant; the first of these were the frost giants, who took their place at the top of the mountains. Others that followed became the other races and moved elsewhere to live their live, making the frost giants the pre-eminent members of their species. At least that is what the frost giants say, and who’s to doubt them. Their artefacts are clearly older than those of any other race, whilst <em>@UUID[.YvplRrSOlzeMa3MI#votunkuura/votunhuurre]{vutunhuurre }</em>has no direct link with any other Obri language, other than <em>@UUID[.YvplRrSOlzeMa3MI#votunkuura/votunhuurre]{votunkuura}</em>. Elderly frost giants are also known to occasionally hibernate, something no other giant-type does.</p><p><strong>Leader: </strong>Routainen Tanner 10th level sorcerer (Cha 18)</p><p></p><h2>Hill</h2><p>Hill – Hill giants took their place amongst the other races when no other giant wanted to live on the “lowlands”. Instead, those who found themselves at the bottom of their own hierarchy move away and banded together on the low peaks and wooded slopes of the Obor hills, becoming their own people. Although this life was difficult, without any of the massive majesty other giant environs offer, <em>@UUID[.eSZclzdgw0E9gdK6#hill-–-lehti]{Lehti }</em>show this new clan how to make the most of their new life and home, things which the hills giants still guard with jealousy, even as many secretly wish they could trace their heritage and return to an original home.</p><p><strong>Leader: </strong>Alava Kumpu 12th level paladin (Wis 14, Cha 12)</p><h2>Merrow</h2><p>Merrow – Although only the most senior clerics or deep-in-trance sorcerers of their will admit it, the original merrow were giants driven from the Obor lands for acting in the worst interests of all Obri. The exact nature of their actions is unclear, but the guidelines of the <em>@UUID[.bUzRK3wWLJPr3eIJ#definicni-obor]{Definicni Obor }</em>make a number of statements that refer to the “outcasts beyond our shores”. To the uninitiated, this seems to simply mean non-giants; internally, it refers to the merrow. <em>@UUID[.eSZclzdgw0E9gdK6#merrow-–-jokijarvi]{Jokijarvi }</em>took up their cause at the request of <em>Pappi</em> and <em>Salainen</em>, who ultimately want all giants to live together, yet know that those who don’t think of the Obri first and foremost need to pay a price. This price is being cursed to ultimately have to live in water, with only short periods on dry land.</p><p>Saltwater merrow are thought to exist, but are very rare if they do.</p><p><strong>Leader: </strong>Vesi Pesa 14th level druid</p><p></p><h2>Ogres</h2><p>Ogres – <em>@UUID[.eSZclzdgw0E9gdK6#ogres-–-kuopus]{Kuopus’s}</em> ogres have always been viewed by other giants as the children of <em>Pappi</em> and <em>Salainen</em>; they are usually loud, vulgar, and act in an out-of-control manner should they pick up barbarian tendencies. But they have also always been the link between the Obri and the outside world. The elves first realised this and gave the giants a number of islands of their eastern coast, where a part-elf-part ogre race developed and flourished, in order for the Obri to present skilled diplomats to the rest of the inhabitants of the planet. To this day, the agreed representative of all the giants is a member of this race, and has been for as long as giants can remember. As the go-between between his parents and the other <em>apulainen,</em> <em>Kuopus </em>knows what it is like to be an emissary,<em> </em>and ensures the chosen <em>elgres</em> do the very best job they can at all times.</p><p><strong>Leader: </strong>Rumilus Hirmu 13th level barbarian</p><h2>Stone</h2><p>Stone – As <em>Pappi</em> and <em>Salainen</em> created the frost giants, <em>@UUID[.eSZclzdgw0E9gdK6#stone-–-paasi]{Passi }</em>sat on a rock and watched. Eventually the ground froze, and then cracked, as the cold seeped into it. From the shards of rock that were created when these cracks occurred, the first stone giants were formed. They were charged with protecting the ground that made up Obor from the frost giants, offering other giant types a chance to find a place to call home. As caretakers of the land, stone giants take their duties very seriously, and will engage with another creature only until it promises to stop harming the land. Then will turn from foe to friend in a moment, help heal the individuals concerned, and send them on their way.</p><p>The stone giants also built the wall that surrounds Obor; along with gnome engineers, the wall was created within a month, with time to spare to have giants everywhere test it by hurling rocks at it. To this day, it has survived any and all assaults.</p><p><strong>Leader: </strong>Jalo Marmori 11th level rogue (Dex 17)</p><h2>Storm</h2><p>Storm – The contrary nature of <em>@UUID[.eSZclzdgw0E9gdK6#storm-–-salama]{Salama}</em> is what drove storm giants to leave the land and take to the air. However, <em>Salama</em> couldn’t quite leave the land behind, and granted storm giants to ability to raise up huge flying citadels that float as might the lightest feather. To this day, tales of aggrieved storm giants uprooting villages and small towns to either save them or punish them occur in equal measure. Storm giants are also called on when drought has occurred as they can, for the right price, ensure enough rain falls to satisfy even the most water-starved area.</p><p>Storm giants have also traditionally overseen the flying fortress that holds a sliver of the “Shard of the Sun” in a highly-protected sphere that is used to power a particularly effective weather machine. This particular task has fallen to one family for many years now, as is a task that is undertaken with complete seriousness.</p><p><strong>Leader: </strong>Alykas Kipina 14th level wizard (Int 17)</p><h2>Trolls</h2><p>Trolls – Any troll will tell you that they spontaneously stepped from the ground the moment <em>@UUID[.eSZclzdgw0E9gdK6#trolls-–-oliivi]{Oliivi} </em>decided that it should be so, and that they will never leave the land until <em>Pappi</em> and <em>Salainen</em> ask them to go. This means not only the troll species as a whole, but also the individuals that make up its number, particularly those that are able to spur the troll nation to bigger and better rewards. Within the giant lands, trolls tend to keep to themselves, fitting in with all the other giant types almost unnoticed. However, when decisions are to be made, senior trolls appear seemingly out of thin air to voice their strongly isolationist views. The other side of this is that they make better-suited individuals for certain professions, and can be trusted to the very end once a deal has been struck (unless another troll is involved).</p><p><strong>Leader: </strong>Kasvaa Paluu 7th Level ranger, 6th level druid</p><h2>Underworld</h2><p>Underworld – As with <em>@UUID[.eSZclzdgw0E9gdK6#underworld-–-maan–uumenissa]{Maan–Uumenissa}</em>, little is known about the history of the underworld giants, more because it is shrouded in mystery rather than individuals not knowing. Nothing is clear about why the original members retreated to the depths, or how they managed to establish themselves once they were there. In fact, the first few giants to retreat into the Underworld were a band who could not decide which of the other <em>apulainen</em> to follow, so left the surface of Obor to follow another path. <em>Maan-Uumenissa</em> found them wandering in despair, and vowed to support them forever onwards, even though the weight of the world was on the god’s shoulders. Since then, Underworld giants have slowly adapted to their home, and are now experts at getting the most from the cold, hard rock around them.</p><p><strong>Leader: </strong>Alempi Kamara 9th level monk (Dex 14, Wis 14)</p></div>","markdown":""},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{"core":{"sheetClass":"core.JournalTextPageSheet"}}},{"sort":500000,"name":"Regions","type":"text","_id":"DGCq9pB33FlnM4rY","title":{"show":false,"level":1},"image":{},"text":{"format":1,"content":"<div class=\"aventyr\"><p class=\"s5\">Regions</p><h2>Ydin-koto</h2><p>The north coast that runs along the side of the @UUID[JournalEntry.QVrlu0lTv2vFtT5P]{Klavek Kingdom} is known as Ydin-koto (Original Home). It is a narrow range of massively tall mountains, some of which are built into the wall surrounding Obor. It is the home of the @UUID[.0ru8kn3zml6fAvTq#frost]{frost giants}, along with many @UUID[.0ru8kn3zml6fAvTq#cloud]{cloud giants} and some storm giants. Links to the Elemental Planes of Air and Earth can be found here, although none are permanent. A continuous storm, roughly 10 miles across, follows a circular path that is about 1,500 miles in circumference, travelling at between 15 and 20 miles a day. Much of this storm is out at sea, but it works its way along the coast for about six or seven days of every 86 day cycle</p><h2>Aitotulivuori</h2><p>The home of the @UUID[.0ru8kn3zml6fAvTq#fire]{fire giants} is Aitotulivuori, which is about three miles high and surrounded by the taller, frozen mountains. It is also situated to the north of Obor, and is considered part of @UUID[.DGCq9pB33FlnM4rY#ydin-koto]{Ydin-koto} by non-giants. There are a number of deep rifts around the base of the volcano, at least two of which descend around nine miles underground. At this depth, a permanent link to the Elemental Plane of Fire can be found, although very few creatures, including the fire giants themselves, ever make it there. Any that are encountered are usually extraplanar visitors, with many coming to or going from a summoning, having completed their part of a bargain or spell; almost all are seen leaving with payments of some kind, sometimes in kind.</p><h2>Ylä–mäki</h2><p>Ylä–mäki which sits in the bay at the top of mainland Obor, is the greatest peak in the country, standing at roughly 13 miles high. Deep within it are the entranceways to the Underworld and giants that make their home there. At its summit, a @UUID[.0ru8kn3zml6fAvTq#frost]{frost giant} observatory sits, watching the skies for the celestial conjunction that will signal ”The Beginning of the End”. This is either a time when all people will come together to live harmoniously, or is the first in a series of cataclysmic events that will trigger the implosion of Obor and its neighbouring lands. Unfortunately, the frost giants aren’t certain which it is that is going to happen. Outside of Obor, it is known as ”High Tor”.</p><h2>Keha and Kaari</h2><p>Off the northern shore are Keha and Kaari (the Ring and the Arc). These islands were formed when debris from the falling ”Shard of the Sun” landed and caused the seabed to rise up above the level of the surface in some places. The islands are often used by @UUID[.0ru8kn3zml6fAvTq#merrow]{merrow} as resting places if, for example, storms become too rough, or they are meeting non-giants for, for example, trading purposes. The islands are riddled with caves and narrow inlets, making currents around them treacherous. Giant pirates operate from here. The islands are also rather gem-rich, as the heat from their creation caused much of the raised seabed to turn to gems, but getting them is difficult.</p><h2>Taivas Tasanko</h2><p>There is a huge mesa plateau, Taivas Tasanko, on a disputed bulge of land that is almost surrounded by Klavek, roughly in the middle of that country’s southern border. The mesa is over three miles high and just about 400 miles in circumference, taking up the whole of the ”bulge”. The wall enclosing Obor is even built around the base of the mesa, to ensure continuity. This is where Pappi and Salainen first stepped on the planet, and is still the first stepping stone for all the apulainen when they visit. On the top of the plateau is a martial monastery and place of worship, Luostari. Every giant race is represented here, although it is not an “equal” place; for example, currently the @UUID[.0ru8kn3zml6fAvTq#athach]{athachs} are camped on the roof, whilst the @UUID[.0ru8kn3zml6fAvTq#merrow]{merrow} have to change their representatives every few days due to the lack of water.</p><h2>Raja Linnoitus</h2><p>The entire southern sea border of Obor is one huge military and governmental administrative building called Raja Linnoitus. This building, built entire for giant-sized occupants, is where anyone visiting Obor is officially allowed to enter. Anyone found in the country without the required paperwork issued from this place has just one chance to be taken into custodial care or will be executed on the spot. The giants are very particular about this. Only two groups – all @UUID[JournalEntry.QlctNkzE9injOde9.JournalEntryPage.lMtTJxWecu1ISdP0]{gnomes} from @UUID[JournalEntry.2cK9lISUylZwk24i]{Pradjna}, and @UUID[JournalEntry.QlctNkzE9injOde9.JournalEntryPage.ei36LjIhEoh87vgE]{elves} who are residents of the Elgres islands – are exempt.</p><h2>The southern border</h2><p>The southern border with the Scorched Lands, and western borders with the unclaimed territories and Pradjna, all have a series of airboat platforms every 50 miles along the protective wall. These towers are roughly half a mile high, with the only landing platform at the top and just one exit at the base. When the Pradjna gnomes helped the giants build the defensive wall around the whole country, the giants gave the gnomes the details of how to make the flying citadels that storm giants use. The gnomes developed airboats for both themselves and the giants, and requested that safe stations be placed on the joint border. These airboats are prized items, in particular those built for giants, and are defended at all costs. Any non-giant or non-gnome in possession of one will find that they receive constant requests to sell it, often for overly-large sums. Neither the giants nor the gnomes like them falling into the hands of other races.</p><h2>Kadotettu</h2><p>Off the coast of the Vast Swamp, towards its northern border with the Scorched Lands, Obor has ownership of an island, Kadotettu, which is the place where the titans left for other realms. It is unclear whether the loss of the titans from the giant population is considered a good or bad state of affairs; the titans were insisting on being allowed a stronger influence over the entire giant population just before their departure, a situation that was causing internal rifts throughout the rest of the @UUID[.bUzRK3wWLJPr3eIJ#obri]{Obri}. Eventually the titans’ request was refused and they left, which brought about a return to internal stability and a golden age when the rest of giantkind took significant strides forward. Kadotettu is now inhabited by a force of @UUID[.0ru8kn3zml6fAvTq#trolls]{trolls}, land-based and aquatic, that protects the ancient titan departure site from treasure hunters and glory-seekers. These trolls are all extremely experienced druids, rangers and sorcerers, for whom the service of guarding the island is one of great honour.</p><h2>Jattaltia</h2><p>At the southern end of the @UUID[JournalEntry.wVQiwLZtRuaqbpFA]{Silent Forest}, in a bay close to @UUID[JournalEntry.oVgfVPmxlNXfN3CW]{Timaeus} and a little further out to sea, Obor has sovereignty of a group of six islands called the Jattaltia. It is here that the ogre-elf clans, the Elgres in Common tongue, live; careful selective matchmaking continues to produce exemplary children who are trained to become the outward-facing elite of Obor. Korkein Esimerkki, 20th-Level Expert, is currently the main contact any of the other races have with Obor (except the gnomes of Pradjna) and he is a member of a prominent Jattaltia family that can trace its mixed lineage back for over 350 generations. These islands are almost identical in nature to the Silent Forest, yet most structures are giant-sized. They also each have an airboat docking tower.</p></div>","markdown":""},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{"core":{"sheetClass":"core.JournalTextPageSheet"}}}],"flags":{"cf":{"id":null},"core":{"sourceId":"Compendium.Aventyr-Campaign-Setting.aventyr-campaign.CZklpkirPVkYlgVp"},"scene-packer":{"hash":"fdd58e3603cfda298b3fd31731d921c0b1350b56"}},"_stats":{"systemId":"dnd5e","systemVersion":"2.1.4","coreVersion":"10.291","createdTime":1664018841723,"modifiedTime":1674975191536,"lastModifiedBy":"EsIYTtNnjwxUbKOG"},"_id":"CZklpkirPVkYlgVp","ownership":{"default":0,"R5IsvMTH5P79pBoG":3},"folder":"j9cXBagzZ1ARsO2I","sort":200000},{"name":"Picollo","pages":[{"sort":200000,"name":"Picollo","type":"text","_id":"Fo8ZyJ0HbBDVVALU","title":{"show":false,"level":1},"image":{},"text":{"format":1,"content":"<div class=\"aventyr\">\n<p class=\"s5\">Picollo</p>\n<img style=\"display:block;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto\" src=\"modules/aaw-games-aventyr/Setting-images/Picollo-map-750x277.webp\" width=\"496\" height=\"246\" /></div>\n<div class=\"aventyr\"> </div>\n<div class=\"aventyr\"><img style=\"float:right;margin:0px 15px 15px 0px;border:0px\" src=\"modules/aaw-games-aventyr/Setting-images/halfling-bosun-copy.webp\" width=\"204\" height=\"287\" />\n<p>Two hundred miles off the southern tip of @UUID[JournalEntry.oVgfVPmxlNXfN3CW]{Timaeus} lay the island nation of Picollo. Once an archipelago stretching deep into the southern ocean, much of its ancient lands were destroyed in the Great Schism, crushed by the falling body of the Dracoprime. Only the big island and a few scattered isles survived the cataclysm some 500 years ago, and since the disaster, the peoples and culture of @UUID[JournalEntry.QlctNkzE9injOde9.JournalEntryPage.myrc4omqUaiD3RKZ]{Halfling} society have struggled for their very survival, some might say for their very souls.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Ancient Picollo was first and foremost a peaceful realm of farmers, drinkers, and enjoyers of all the good stuff that life has to offer. Halflings were simple and open people, finding beauty in all the blessings that the gods placed upon their island homes. @UUID[.Gv1vyttllOYQaK2t#mainland-picollo-–-the-big-island]{Mainland Picollo – The Big Island} was covered in green rolling farmlands, save for the @UUID[.Gv1vyttllOYQaK2t#the-great-mountain]{The Great Mountain} in the north, and @UUID[.Gv1vyttllOYQaK2t#the-great-forest]{The Great Forest}to the west. The isles of the archipelago provided a diversity of agricultural products and stimulated halfling naval architecture and maritime trade; in its heyday, the merchant fleets of Picollo traded with most of Aventyr, and trading enclaves from other nations were common on the big island. Many of these grew into larger towns and cities, in contrast to halfling settlements, which remained centered on village life.</p>\n<p>The destruction of the Great Schism changed the face of Picollo forever. The two hundred years following the cataclysm were consumed by efforts to survive and rebuild, but just as the land and people started to recover, @UUID[JournalEntry.QlctNkzE9injOde9.JournalEntryPage.SGw7zGFtvjLNPDMY]{Hoyrall} burst onto the scene. For two centuries the aliens tunnelled inside the great mountain, and then to other parts of Aventyr through the caverns and tunnels of the Underworld that intersected with the new construction. Hives that remained behind launched a full scale invasion of the halfling lands—the invading force wiped out halfling villages everywhere they went, colonizing the land and setting up new hives like mindless drones. The only diplomacy they engaged in was to strip away the alliances of the human settlements in Picollo; the twicelings thought themselves safe but when the ties were cut, the hoyrall broke their agreements and turned, destroying them utterly.</p>\n<p>The remaining halflings took to the forest and isolated slopes of the great mountain. Stealth, trickery, and valiant assaults kept the sorely pressed halflings from being completely overrun, but it was the Confluence and breaking of the hoyrall hive-mind that allowed them to make headway against the invaders. The halflings joined forces with the fey of the great forest and the @UUID[JournalEntry.QlctNkzE9injOde9.JournalEntryPage.t4LZuyNruvzneOHD]{Dwarf} of @UUID[.Gv1vyttllOYQaK2t#stoneroot]{Stoneroot}, wiping their land clean of the insectoid invaders.</p>\n<p>Recovery has been slow; @UUID[JournalEntry.QlctNkzE9injOde9.JournalEntryPage.myrc4omqUaiD3RKZ]{Halfling} tribes returned to their homes to find everything their ancestors had built completely destroyed. They had to start from scratch and build anew. Though once drawn together by a common enemy, despair and exhaustion has taken its toll. In ancient times, nearby villages often joined together to accomplish greater projects than they could alone: now, the rebuilding of Picollo is insular and clannish. Desperate for labor but wary of other humanoids, indentured servitude has been introduced across the island for would-be immigrants. Travelers to these lands find scant welcome and are carefully watched, spied upon by night. Most visitors rarely travel further than the coastal ports due to the @UUID[.PmrSWZmvMcJz6g4H#xenophobia]{Xenophobia} in Picollan villages. Any non-halfling in the interior is assumed to be an @UUID[.PmrSWZmvMcJz6g4H#indentured-servitude]{Indentured Servitude}, or perhaps a freedman who has completed his term of service.</p>\n<p>Modern halflings pay lip service to the merry and celebratory traditions of ancient times, and the end of the wars means that the traditional festivals are once again being celebrated, but there is a darker shadow now to their people, an untrustworthy part. This is the part that forges secret pacts, creates thieves guilds, and negotiates dark deals in an effort to protect the halfling way of life and prevent outsiders from again invading or betraying their kin.</p>\n</div>","markdown":""},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{"core":{"sheetClass":""}}},{"sort":300000,"name":"History","type":"text","_id":"fP5CHtZClE3BVaIe","title":{"show":false,"level":2},"image":{},"text":{"format":1,"content":"<div class=\"aventyr\">\n<p class=\"s5\">History</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Circa -6,000:</strong> Primitive halflings once watched over by the fey of the @UUID[.Gv1vyttllOYQaK2t#the-great-forest]{The Great Forest} begin to develop agriculture, primarily to raise domestic crops of barley for beer, honey for mead, and pipeweed.

While most of these leaders paid lip service to the ancient tradition of the eldermoot, this sense of expedience laid the foundation for the formation of secret societies and deal-making that still exists in Picollo, even with the re-establishment of the ancient assembly.</p><header class=\"journal-page-header\" style=\"box-sizing:border-box;user-select:text;color:rgb(25, 24, 19);font-family:Signika, sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-variant-ligatures:normal;font-variant-caps:normal;font-weight:400;letter-spacing:normal;orphans:2;text-align:start;text-indent:0px;text-transform:none;white-space:normal;widows:2;word-spacing:0px;-webkit-text-stroke-width:0px;text-decoration-thickness:initial;text-decoration-style:initial;text-decoration-color:initial\"><h3><span style=\"font-family:Signika, sans-serif\"><span style=\"font-family:Signika, sans-serif\">The Eldermoot</span></span></h3></header><section class=\"journal-page-content\" style=\"box-sizing:border-box;user-select:text;color:rgb(25, 24, 19);font-family:Signika, sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-variant-ligatures:normal;font-variant-caps:normal;font-weight:400;letter-spacing:normal;orphans:2;text-align:start;text-indent:0px;text-transform:none;white-space:normal;widows:2;word-spacing:0px;-webkit-text-stroke-width:0px;text-decoration-thickness:initial;text-decoration-style:initial;text-decoration-color:initial\"><p style=\"box-sizing:border-box;user-select:text;margin:0.5em 0px;min-height:1rem\"><span style=\"font-family:Signika, sans-serif\"><span style=\"font-family:Signika, sans-serif\">An assembly of elders from the villages all over Picollo, the Eldermoot meets in @UUID[.Gv1vyttllOYQaK2t#the-nines]{The Nines}, a collection of nine villages within easy walking distance of each other loosely recognized as the capitol. Any elder visiting The Nines is free to participate in the ongoing debates and discussions; the Eldermoot serves more as a cultural communications hub rather than a legislative assembly. Its decrees and proclamations have only the force of recommendations to the villages throughout Picollo with the single exception of matters relating to indentured servitude and freedman colonies—both of which are strictly regulated throughout Picollo.</span></span></p><p style=\"box-sizing:border-box;user-select:text;margin:0.5em 0px;min-height:1rem\"><span style=\"font-family:Signika, sans-serif\"><span style=\"font-family:Signika, sans-serif\">The First Speaker, along with an advisory board of four Second Speakers, runs the meetings throughout the year and manages a professional team of scribes and servants that record the events in assembly. The First Speaker is elected every spring from amongst the elders present during the Festival of Renewal and receives a stipend to cover all costs of the administration (as well as his own personal living expenses) from funds collected at the close of each debate—some unpopular Speakers are reduced to penury when the donations dry up. Bribery within the Eldermoot is almost unheard of as most of the edicts of the Eldermoot have little force in law.</span></span></p><h3><span style=\"font-family:Signika, sans-serif\"><span style=\"font-family:Signika, sans-serif\">Board of Indentures and the Council of Freedmen</span></span></h3><p><span style=\"font-family:Signika, sans-serif\"><span style=\"font-family:Signika, sans-serif\">Since the introduction of @UUID[.PmrSWZmvMcJz6g4H#indentured-servitude]{indentured} servitude in Picollo some six cycles of servants have served their terms and achieved freedman status—many thousands more are serving out their indentureship. Responsible for the legislation and regulation of both indentured servitude and freedman rights, ten halfling elders sit on the Board of Indentures. The original ten elders were elected by the @UUID[.X0uyBqIKLevC15mx#the-eldermoot]{Eldermoot;} currently election to the board is the prerogative of the Council of Freedmen. The appointment is for life and the council has had the opportunity to elect only four replacements in the last fifty years. With these younger fellows, the six original members enjoy their venerable years dominating the most politically influential group in Picollo.</span></span></p><p><span style=\"font-family:Signika, sans-serif\"><span style=\"font-family:Signika, sans-serif\">The Council of Freedmen consists of seven freedmen serving the interests of both freedmen and indentures throughout Picollo. Its representatives are chosen not by the freedmen themselves, but by the Eldermoot at the same time as the speakers. A councillor serves a single term of seven years, and the terms are staggered so that a new councillor replaces a retiring one every year. The most powerful influence the council retains is the election of a member to the Board of Indentures, but as this opportunity comes rarely, one could argue how much influence actually resides within the prerogative.</span></span></p><p><span style=\"font-family:Signika, sans-serif\"><span style=\"font-family:Signika, sans-serif\">The council sits in the Eldermoot seven days out of every ten, but is granted the right to speak only on the first and last day of each cycle (the Right of Voice). The council usually meets in private during the three-day banishment, when the Eldermoot (advised by the Board of Indentures) is free to discuss freedman issues without prying ears.</span></span></p><p><span style=\"font-family:Signika, sans-serif\"><span style=\"font-family:Signika, sans-serif\">Legislation regarding freedman and indentured rights may only be proposed by members of the Board of Indentures, although freedman councillors can speak to the issue when they have the Right of Voice. Freedmen councillors also vote on proposed legislation. Passing, amending, or abolishing a law requires a majority vote on both the Board and the Council.</span></span></p><p><span style=\"font-family:Signika, sans-serif\"><span style=\"font-family:Signika, sans-serif\">Unlike election to the Eldermoot, bribery is commonplace in the Council of Freedmen and within the Board of Indentures. Members of both bodies are courted by conservative and progressive villages in regards to indentured rights, and having a tame freedman councillor or a friendly ear on the Board can be useful.</span></span></p><h3><span style=\"font-family:Signika, sans-serif\"><span style=\"font-family:Signika, sans-serif\">Guilds and Secret Societies</span></span></h3><p><span style=\"font-family:Signika, sans-serif\"><span style=\"font-family:Signika, sans-serif\">Though not part of formal government, Picollo is rife with guilds, collectives, and secret societies.

Gone are the days of bucolic, carefree attitudes and the joy of discovery. The traditional (and often religious) ties of family and community are threatened by an increasing reliance on deal making and practicality. Some families and villages long to return to the ancient traditions, but modern halflings have scant experience with them, save tales of days long past. Most halflings attempt to live a life of tradition as evidenced in these tales, but the agrarian, village-centric life only masks a deeper and more cynical pragmatism.</p>\n<h2>Xenophobia</h2>\n<p>Due to their enslavement during the Hoyrall Wars and betrayal by humanoid settlements in their lands, halflings have become very protective of each other. This protection manifests in different ways; at a very young age all halflings are taught to help one another regardless of their moral standing or ulterior motives. As they grow to maturity, however, halflings begin to realize that they have survived in part due to a darker heritage, one of suspicion and mistrust. This heritage is the one that forges secret pacts, thieves guilds, and dark deals to protect the halfling way of life and prevent outsiders from again betraying or invading their lands. Even with this dark shadow, it is taboo for one halfling to kill another even under dire circumstances—those that do face banishment.</p>\n<p>Halflings of mainland Picollo (and the Isles) do regard the @UUID[JournalEntry.QlctNkzE9injOde9.JournalEntryPage.RTYoyteEKY7EOhy2]{Dweorg}of Stonehelm as worthy allies, as well as the fey of the @UUID[.Gv1vyttllOYQaK2t#the-great-forest]{Great Forest}.

In desperate need of labor to rebuild, halfling merchants often collect the downtrodden and out-of-luck across Aventyr to ship home and bind to a seven-year term of service. Not only does this provide additional labor and hard coin for the merchant captains who ply the seas, some halflings believe a term of service will teach those of other races the value of loyalty.</p>\n<h2>Religion</h2>\n<img style=\"float:right;margin:0px 15px 15px 0px;border:0px\" src=\"modules/aaw-games-aventyr/Setting-images/Great-Mother.webp\" width=\"195\" height=\"280\" />\n<p>Worship of @UUID[JournalEntry.dOJJ8mRNTPtoihmF.JournalEntryPage.7JZLaCukpLMqn2R2]{The Mother Spirit} still pervades halfling culture and has spread to other lands by way of the many exiles residing across Aventyr. Villages are centered around the Holy Tree of of the central green where communal worship is held. The pressures and loss of the Hoyrall Wars have undermined the tenets of community espoused by the Great Mother however, and a village religious leader is as often as not to be a “@UUID[JournalEntry.dOJJ8mRNTPtoihmF.JournalEntryPage.7JZLaCukpLMqn2R2#fallen-leaf-cleric]{Fallen Leaf cleric}”, not through any evil or heretical design, but simply through an erosion of the ancient understandings.

The big island is 400 miles wide at its widest point. At the northern end of the island, the weather is temperate and the Great Mountain rises seven miles to its peak. The western side of the island sports the Great Forest, while the eastern side is made up of rolling farmlands in the interior and deepwater ports on the coast. The fractured southern tip of the island still bears the scars of the Great Schism, and overland travel is difficult in the sub-tropical climate of the south due to the number of fresh and brackish waterways permeating the broken landscape.</p><h3>The Nines</h3><p>LN large town</p><p><strong>Corruption:</strong> +0; <strong>Crime:</strong> +0; <strong>Economy:</strong> +2; <strong>Law:</strong> +1; <strong>Lore:</strong> +0; <strong>Society:</strong> +3</p><p><strong>Qualities:</strong> rumormongering citizens, strategic location, tourist attraction</p><p><strong>Danger:</strong> +5</p><p>DEMOGRAPHICS</p><p><strong>Government:</strong> council</p><p><strong>Population:</strong> 4,750 (3,500 @UUID[JournalEntry.QlctNkzE9injOde9.JournalEntryPage.myrc4omqUaiD3RKZ]{Halfling}; 30 @UUID[JournalEntry.QlctNkzE9injOde9.JournalEntryPage.RTYoyteEKY7EOhy2]{Dweorg}, 200 freedmen humans, 20 freedman other, 900@UUID[.PmrSWZmvMcJz6g4H#indentured-servitude]{ indentured} humans; 100 indentured others)</p><p><strong>Notable NPCs</strong></p><p><strong>Eseld Penberry, First Speaker</strong> (LN Female halfling aristocrat 9)</p><p><strong>Wren Machek, Freedman Councillor</strong> (NE Male human expert 8/warrior 3)</p><p><strong>@UUID[.D1IrajgFIr9gyZFw#jory-tremorgan]{Jory Tremorgan}, Historian</strong> (NG Male halfling wizard 5/expert 7)</p><p>MARKETPLACE</p><p><strong>Base Value:</strong> 2,600 gp; <strong>Purchase Limit:</strong> 10,000 gp; <strong>Spellcasting:</strong> 5th</p><p><strong>Minor Items:</strong> [[/roll 3d4]]; <strong>Medium Items:</strong> [[/roll 2d4]]; Major Items [[/roll 1d4]]</p><p>Located at the mouth of the Marigold river, the nine villages that host the @UUID[.X0uyBqIKLevC15mx#the-eldermoot]{Eldermoot}, @UUID[.X0uyBqIKLevC15mx#board-of-indentures-and-the-council-of-freedmen]{Board of Indentures}, and the@UUID[.X0uyBqIKLevC15mx#board-of-indentures-and-the-council-of-freedmen]{ Council of Freedmen} consist of a deepwater port, milling villages along the river, fishing villages up and down the coast, and farming villages, all within half a day’s travel of each other. Individually, the deepwater port of Culloden and the government seat of Scrivenston would be considered small towns, but the symbiotic relationship of all nine settlements together creates a stronger municipal collective.</p><p>Not included in the name (but certainly in the population count) is a tenth settlement, the freedman colony of Rivercross. Situated across the river from Scrivenston, this village of some 120 souls contains some of the wealthiest freedmen in Picollo. Many owe their riches to a term of service on the Council of Freedmen (with its attendant bribes) and some retain considerable political influence. A few of the freedmen in Rivercross keep indentures of their own, and in general indentures and freedmen from other colonies across Picollo hate those who dwell within and all that Rivercross stands for: the perpetuation of the injustices of the halflings’ “peculiar institution”.</p><p></p><h2>The Isles</h2><p>The ancient archipelago once consisted of thousands of smaller islands stretching three thousand miles to the southwest. Only a handful survived the tectonic disturbances and tidal waves that accompanied the fall of the Dracoprime; the highest concentration of these islands are within 300 miles of the southern tip of the big island. The islands vary in habitability from the uninhabited desert island to tropical paradises; the warming ocean currents of the south flow east to west off the southern tip of mainland Picollo. Clans and villages of seaborn halflings are sometimes found on these islands. The most dangerous stretch of the sea is known as the Spine of the Dragon, where the vertebrae of the Dracoprime pierces the surface of the ocean, creating vicious currents and putting ships at hazard.</p><h2>The Great Mountain</h2><p>The base of the mountain is over 100 miles in diameter, surrounded by rolling hills. No other peaks compete with the seven-mile high summit; the mass that is the Great Mountain is unique. Many valleys and rises, both forested and grassy, lie sheltered on the great slopes of the mountain and alluvial rivers cascade off cliffsides, running swiftly through these vales. The civilized races on the mountain include the @UUID[JournalEntry.QlctNkzE9injOde9.JournalEntryPage.RTYoyteEKY7EOhy2]{Dweorg} at the base in their city of @UUID[.Gv1vyttllOYQaK2t#stoneroot]{Stoneroot}, highland halfling clans on the slopes, and @UUID[JournalEntry.QlctNkzE9injOde9.JournalEntryPage.MsDyrandNiqdPIrd]{Zwerc} cloud fortresses near the peak. Monsters and tribes of monstrous humanoids (as well as some giants) live in the many hidden valleys of the mountain; some have even taken over the old @UUID[JournalEntry.QlctNkzE9injOde9.JournalEntryPage.SGw7zGFtvjLNPDMY]{Hoyrall} tunnels that riddle portions of the Great Mountain’s interior (though hoyrall have not been seen on the slopes or in the tunnels of the Great Mountain since the end of the wars.) An amber road runs from deep within the bones of the mountain to its peak, guarded by the dweorgs of Stonehelm and the zwerc in the clouds above.</p><h3>Stoneroot</h3><p>LN small city</p><p><strong>Corruption:</strong> +-1; <strong>Crime:</strong> +1; <strong>Economy:</strong> +4; <strong>Law:</strong> +2; <strong>Lore:</strong> -1; <strong>Society:</strong> +6</p><p><strong>Qualities:</strong> holy site, prosperous, strategic location, tourist attraction</p><p><strong>Danger:</strong> +5</p><p>DEMOGRAPHICS</p><p><strong>Government:</strong> council</p><p><strong>Population:</strong> 8,850 (7,000 @UUID[JournalEntry.QlctNkzE9injOde9.JournalEntryPage.RTYoyteEKY7EOhy2]{Dweorg}; 500 @UUID[JournalEntry.QlctNkzE9injOde9.JournalEntryPage.myrc4omqUaiD3RKZ]{Halfling}; 1,000 humans (freedmen); 100 @UUID[.PmrSWZmvMcJz6g4H#indentured-servitude]{indentured} humans; 250 other)</p><p><strong>Notable NPCs</strong></p><p><strong>Rogan Hardamber, Dwarven Council</strong> (LN Male dweorg fighter 9)</p><p><strong>Rory Bessamer, Freedman Demagogue</strong> (CN Male human bard 7)</p><p><strong>@UUID[.D1IrajgFIr9gyZFw#elerin-crosseyes]{Elerin Crosseyes}, Merchant</strong> (LN Female halfling expert 10)</p><p>MARKETPLACE</p><p><strong>Base Value:</strong> 6,400 gp; <strong>Purchase Limit:</strong> 37,250 gp; <strong>Spellcasting:</strong> 8th</p><p><strong>Minor Items:</strong> [[/roll 4d4]]; <strong>Medium Items:</strong> [[/roll 3d4]]; <strong>Major Items:</strong> [[/roll 1d6]]</p><p>The city of Stoneroot is carved into walls of a great sea cavern at the base of the Great Mountain on the eastern shore of mainland Picollo. The size of the entrance to the cave as well as a great underground river allows a significant amount of maritime trade to pass through the city, and the dweorg keep a harbor fleet of galleys for defense. Tunnels and avenues lead to the surface, as well as deeper into the mountain itself.</p><p>The dweorg are excellent smiths; magical arms and armor under the base price are more likely to be available in Stoneroot (85%), but staves, rings, wands, rods, and wondrous items are less likely to be available (65%). Most such items are brokered by halfling middlemen who represent zwerc mages from the cloud fortresses above, or on the black market, due to the friction between dweorg and zwerc. Scrolls and potions can be found normally.</p><p>The non-dweorg population of Stoneroot consists of halfling diplomats, merchants, and craftsmen, and their indentured servants (the dweorg do not keep indentures), as well as freedmen. Many abolitionist societies use this city as a base of operations, due to the more egalitarian government of the dwarves.</p><h2>The Great Forest</h2><p>One of the last bastions of resistance during the wars, the Great Forest suffered the least damage from the @UUID[JournalEntry.QlctNkzE9injOde9.JournalEntryPage.SGw7zGFtvjLNPDMY]{Hoyrall} invaders. Though some portions of the perimeter suffered depredation, the interior maintains its primaeval characteristics, guarded and husbanded by the fey living within. Magical and mystical creatures also share the virgin woodland; not all are friendly. In addition to the fey living in the woods, villages of tree-borer halflings can also be found, as well as the scattered humanoid settlements of runaway indentures and independently inclined freedmen.</p><p>The Great Oak of the Mother is located somewhere in the Great Forest. In ancient times, holy druids transplanted acorns from the tree to the central greens of many halfling communities. Only a few of these “Second Growth” trees survive; they are among the most powerful foci of divine magic on the island.

A hero may be the exception to the rule, but will never let other races know the secrets of their homeland. Elves live for thousands of years and have an inner-wisdom of the natural world that humans will never attain. They are aloof and secretive and generally keep to themselves. The majority of elves live within the protective confines of the @UUID[JournalEntry.wVQiwLZtRuaqbpFA]{Silent Forest} to the south of the @UUID[JournalEntry.QVrlu0lTv2vFtT5P]{Klavek Kingdom}. The Silent Forest is a magical place where humans are forbidden, and those who have ventured into the forest never return. An elf cannot willingly give up the secrets of her homeland even if tortured, magically manipulated, or even psionically attacked. Most elves choose either the path of magic or nature and given the seemingly endless life they are gifted, excel marvellously in either.</p>\n<h2>The Vast Swamp</h2>\n<p>Magic is used by the Black Gold Consortium to speed up extraction and enhance the efficiency of its workers, tasks excelled at by elven mages and alchemists—it spends a hefty sum to these scholars if they can provide results. Elves reluctantly take the money for their services but their true reasons for inhabiting the area remain hidden from the Black Gold Consortium. The elves’ love of nature is always paramount and the reason why they are truly working with them is to see that the business does not damage the ecosystem of the swamp. Magic means of extraction are cleaner and less damaging to the area, and there are whispers of a secret order of elven saboteurs who work towards stopping any forms of extraction that the elves do not approve of.

Large portions of their island home of @UUID[JournalEntry.PCe82J4UbHQWFYYL]{Picollo} far to the southeast remain uninhabited. Enclaves of exiles across the breadth and width of Aventyr have exposed many nations and races to the existence of halflings, but many isolated folks often perceive them as children or humans of stunted growth.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Halflings bear scant trust for the other races of Aventyr, especially humans, whom they view as feckless and faithless. Halflings from exiled backgrounds are more likely to be trusting of non-halflings and tend to hold more true to the ancient ways and happy-go-lucky traditions of halfling society. Those whose families suffered during the @UUID[.SGw7zGFtvjLNPDMY]{Hoyrall} Wars and enslavement are more prone to pragmatism. This practical outlook has begun to erode the traditional paths of fellowship and community. Though fragile, a bond does still remain between all halflings; it is taboo for one halfling to kill another even under dire circumstances; those that do face banishment. When banding together in groups halflings are a force to be reckoned with.</p>\n<h2>Vast Swamp</h2>\n<p>Halflings are often called upon when the Black Gold Consortium needs something done in a tight spot. Small folk can often find employment cleaning or fixing in-between the cogs of extraction centers, or removing blockages in tall chimneys or long pipes; the work is always dangerous, so they expect to be paid well. The Neliton family is one of the core families in the consortium and in charge of halfling relations in @UUID[JournalEntry.g4odaMsHbRkeNFhn.JournalEntryPage.Tdkqx23iD22AVlLv]{Cherrian’s Rest}. The family’s easy going nature has protected them from the internal conflicts of the consortium—they love to show off their strong sense of fashion. The Nelitons are the trendsetting family of the Consortium, often wearing the finest garments and jewels just to show off their lavishness and to invoke the jealousy of the other families.</p>\n<h2>Subtypes</h2>\n<h3>Seaborn</h3>\n<p>Most of the of the archipelago that made up greater @UUID[JournalEntry.PCe82J4UbHQWFYYL]{Picollo}was buried under the sea when the Dracoprime fell in the Great Schism, but scattered isles remain. Some halflings spend their whole lives on ships traveling between these isles, mainland Picollo, and the rest of Aventyr. While they feel bonds of kinship to all halflings, their ties to their shipmates are the closest. Years of fighting wind and wave have taught them caution, and that discretion is often the better part of valor.</p>\n<h3>Highlanders</h3>\n<p>On the @UUID[JournalEntry.PCe82J4UbHQWFYYL.JournalEntryPage.Gv1vyttllOYQaK2t#the-great-mountain]{The Great Mountain}, the highland halflings were in the thickest fighting during the @UUID[.SGw7zGFtvjLNPDMY]{Hoyrall} Wars as the insect-like race spewed forth from the tunnels and chambers riddling the great peak. Alliances with the @UUID[.RTYoyteEKY7EOhy2]{dweorg} at the base of the mountain and the @UUID[.MsDyrandNiqdPIrd]{zwerc} its top provided arms and armor and magic during the struggle, and often a place of retreat.</p>\n<h3>Tree-Borers</h3>\n<p>These halfling clans live alongside the fey in @UUID[JournalEntry.PCe82J4UbHQWFYYL.JournalEntryPage.Gv1vyttllOYQaK2t#the-great-forest]{the great forest of Picollo}. They make their homes in living trees, hollowed out with a combination of plant husbandry and fey magic. Endless pranks and tricks played on the halflings by their fey neighbors often have them cursing their luck. The tree-borers took in many refugees during the @UUID[.SGw7zGFtvjLNPDMY]{Hoyrall} Wars, and the final resistance was mounted from within the forest itself.

The Vikmordere had been using @UUID[JournalEntry.ismpCNWpGHvB1iPw]{Rybalka}, a village of tribal fishermen and woodworkers as a base of operations for their attacks on the three Riverside Klavekian villages. The village of Rybalka also works a local iron mine which supplied ore for the Vikmordere weapons and shipbuilding tools.</p>\n<p>  The Klavek Kingdom Monarchy moved troops into the Vikmordere Valley and launched an arduous assault against the Vikmordere in hopes of securing this strategic location and obtaining the lucrative iron mine. After many failed attempts and the death of hundreds of Klavekian ground troops, the Klavek Kingdom was finally able to oust the Vikmordere raiders and take over the small village and local mine. In order to hold the location, additional troops were brought in to clear the mountainside forests of the rest of the Vikmordere warriors which resulted in horrible casualties for the Klavekians. Eventually, almost every Vikmordere in a 15-mile radius was slaughtered. A few Vikmordere survived by hiding in abandoned ruins and mountain caves, which were passed up by the Klavek Kingdom soldiers seeing as it was impossible to follow every possible lead in such a large territory.</p>\n<p>The majority of the Vikmordere people still thrive in the mountains and in the deep recesses of the winding Serpent Lake, waiting for the day when a great Vikmordere champion rises up to lead them to victory and reclamation of their ancestor’s land and the village now called “Rybalka” by the filthy Klavs.</p>\n</div>","markdown":""},"_id":"sPIEyCZy4k35amgs","image":{},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"sort":900000,"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"JournalEntry.aQr9obWamQcmAPUN.JournalEntryPage.wRMpAyePvqRtSHn0"}}},{"name":"Human (Klavekian)","type":"text","title":{"show":false,"level":2},"text":{"format":1,"content":"<div class=\"aventyr\">\n<p class=\"s5\">Human (Klavekian)</p>\n<img style=\"float:left;margin:0px 15px 15px 0px;border:0px\" src=\"modules/aaw-games-aventyr/Races-Images/Klavekian-Human-Male.webp\" width=\"282\" height=\"365\" />\n<p><em> </em></p>\n<p>Klavekians are a hearty steadfast people who have been dealt with impossible odds and found ways to cope.

The limited time available to the undead wizard prevented wide dispersal of the anti-colloid virus, leaving the extraterrestrial sentience puzzled by how any creature can resist its psyche (there is a 1% chance that a PC has been exposed to this otherwise benign virus and is immune to the detrimental effects of the colloid). Colliatur are often found leading the subjects of the colloid—their independence proving to be an attracting force to the alien’s thralls—and may be encountered anywhere in the Underworld or Upperworld.</p>\n<p>   Exploring is a natural impulse for the colliatur, and spreading the message of the alien overmind is their first priority.

They stayed deep beneath the world toiling in their greatest cities, only an echo of their former selves.</p>\n<p><strong>The third </strong>were named the @UUID[.MsDyrandNiqdPIrd]{Zwerc}, created from the spirits of the Dvergr. This granted them innate power over magic, their mystical nature making them loners and travelers with an endless thirst for knowledge.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The potent avarice of the Dvergr, however, would not be undone by the gods—traveling far from the deific crafting, the very essence of their greed delved deep into Aventyr, much deeper than the gods had permitted the Dvergr to go. Soon they had discovered HEL—where devils and demons dwell—and while the first three races were created, a pact was forged with the denizens there. The devils granted the Dvergr’s avarice physical form and realms in the deepest, most foul and flaming depths of the Underworld—but they did not stop there. The devils gave the @UUID[.Atn2VIF5a1D1uJUZ]{Gitwerc} the ability to siphon souls from the other races to feed themselves, and in turn they granted the Gitwerc more power.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>When the gods returned to forge the fourth, they found the Dvergr’s entrails snatched up by devils who had turned them into a terrible creature, the Gitwerc.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The gods, realizing their mistake in creating a race with no evil intent, vowed never to do so again and went to work creating the fifth race in secret, using all the remaining parts of the Dvergr. The fifth and final race would be eloquent, honorable, knowledgeable, and nearly immortal, yet the race would be forever divided, torn between light and darkness. Their souls were permanently bound to the world, sentenced with a nearly endless life staring out upon the sea of eternity, never able to attain that balance which comes so easy to the other races. The gods placed this race above and below the world, both in light and in darkness; they became the @UUID[.ei36LjIhEoh87vgE]{Elves} and the @UUID[.8HyVcZ70eyhwNJsu]{Drow}.</p>\n<p>     Then the gods did something which surprised all of the races.

In the past, Vikmordere raiders used the strategic location of the fishing village as a launching point for attacks against the @UUID[JournalEntry.QVrlu0lTv2vFtT5P]{Klavek Kingdom}. An abundant iron mine nearby provided all the ore the Vikmordere raiders needed for their tools, weapons, and armor.</p>\n<p>The Klavekian Monarchy moved troops into the @UUID[JournalEntry.Cg0Nt8mDPQ7JrmyB]{Vikmordere Valley} and launched an arduous assault against the Vikmordere in hopes of securing this strategic location and obtaining the lucrative iron mine. After many failed attempts and the deaths of hundreds of Klavekian ground troops, the Klavek Kingdom was finally able to oust the Vikmordere raiders from Rybalka. In order to hold the location, additional troops were brought in to clear the mountainside forests of the rest of the Vikmordere warriors. This resulted in horrible casualties for the Klavekians, losing 10 soldiers for every 1 Vikmordere raider found and killed. Many of the Vikmordere avoided persecution by hiding in abandoned ruins and mountain caves where it is thought they still exist to this day.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<img style=\"display:block;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto\" src=\"modules/aaw-games-aventyr/Setting-images/Serpent-Lake-Map-Todd-Gamble.png\" width=\"650\" height=\"571\" />\n<p> </p>\n<img style=\"float:right;margin:0px 15px 15px 0px;border:0px\" title src=\"modules/aaw-games-aventyr/Setting-images/Klavekian-Warrior-Nestor-the-Dragon-480x579.webp\" width=\"272\" height=\"328\" />\n<p>The Klavek Kingdom placed a permanent contingent of guardsmen at Rybalka to protect the populace and the vital iron mine.</p>\n<p>Without access to the ore in the mine, the Vikmordere’s military strength and foothold on the region has been greatly reduced.</p>\n<p>Many Rybalkan Vikmordere villagers who were not affiliated with the raiders were allowed to stay and live freely in the village if they continued to provide services to the Klavek Kingdom settlers. These services include blacksmithing, fishing, mining, and ship construction as well as various menial tasks requested from time to time. Racism in Rybalka is still quite prevalent, especially amongst the Klavekian settlers, and a few interracial families that were harassed and persecuted by the Klavekians moved into the dangerous and unforgiving wilderness just to escape the ignorance and hatred of the average Klavekian settler.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<img style=\"display:block;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto\" src=\"modules/aaw-games-aventyr/Setting-images/Rybalka-close-up-750x465.webp\" width=\"607\" height=\"423\" />\n<h2>Fishing</h2>\n<p>Rybalka has established a very lucrative trade with the other towns and cities in the @UUID[JournalEntry.QVrlu0lTv2vFtT5P]{Klavek homeland}. The rare mountain fish caught in the @UUID[.Erya8w29cRTTJELu]{Serpent Lake} are highly coveted in the metropolitan areas of the Klavek Kingdom.</p>\n<h2>Logging</h2>\n<p>Two logging camps exist on the Rybalkan Peninsula. The most prominent of these is a @UUID[.mGX47vjQ83yO2l2T#logging]{small logging camp} which exists in the forested hills west of Rybalka. The camp contains two outbuildings, a smithy, and logging equipment. A water flume redirects water from a stream in the hills into the camp to turn a mill-blade and operate saws. Trees are harvested and transported out of the hills and into the great glacial lake. The logs are then loaded on a barge to float down Serpent Lake to the Serpent Tail River and into the waiting hands of the Klavek riverside settlements below.</p>\n<h2>Mining</h2>\n<p>The heavily fortified Rybalkan Mine is northeast of Rybalka. The iron mine imports/exports directly with the Klavekian Monarchy and does not fall under Rybalkan jurisdiction despite its close proximity. The mined ore is shipped via replica Vikmordere vessels through the @UUID[.Erya8w29cRTTJELu]{Serpent Lake} and Serpent’s Tail River into the Klavek Homeland. The large amounts of ore being pulled from the mine has prompted the Klavek Kingdom to invest additional funding and expansion plans to Rybalka as well as an increase in ground troops to patrol the nearby countryside.</p>\n<h2>Climate</h2>\n<p>The temperature varies considerably depending on the season; summer can be as warm as 65F (18C) and winter can be as cold as 8F (-13C). There is generally snow on the ground from early fall until mid spring, although depending on weather patterns this can change.</p>\n<p>Cold winds tend to rush down out of the mountains in winter and push through the valley and down Serpent Lake into the lowland plains below. In winter much of the lake freezes over completely making travel by boat difficult if not impossible.</p>\n<p>In spring when the snow begins to melt many animals with new offspring venture down to the shores of the Serpent Lake. The surrounding forested hillsides go into full bloom. Spring and summer both display the beauty of the land and the true reason why the locals stay and live in such a harsh environment most of the year.</p>\n<p>The end of summer is a time of feasting and celebration.</p>\n<h2>Everyday Life</h2>\n<p>A Rybalkan day begins as the sun finally reaches high enough in the sky to cast its light over the jagged peaks of the Eastern Mountains. The suns rays hit the crystallized snow cover creating myriad colors; lights begin to dance upon the partially frozen @UUID[.Erya8w29cRTTJELu]{Serpent Lake}. The folk living in the small village begin to stir and go about their daily duties; fishermen push their skiffs over the jagged chunks of ice and into the water, Rybalkan Soldiers gear up for wilderness patrols, and the blacksmith stokes the fire at the smithy.</p>\n<h2>Trades</h2>\n<p>The majority of townsfolk in Rybalka are lumberjacks, miners, or fishermen. The only other trades in Rybalka obtain their roots in the three major professions thus woodworking, blacksmithing, and cooking are the secondary trades.</p>\n<h2>Construction</h2>\n<p>Most of the structures in Rybalka are cabins and constructed of wood harvested from the nearby mountain forest. A few permanent structures like the Rybalka Temple are built from stone.</p>\n<h2>Tradition</h2>\n<p>The entrance to a man’s cabin usually has a large set of antlers hanging directly over the door as a sign of virility. Upon marrying, the wife will traditionally hang small bundles of aromatic herbs from the antlers, along with semi-precious stones placed in specific places upon them using tree sap; these herbs are refreshed by the wife weekly.</p>\n<p>When a married couple gives birth to their first child, they take down the antlers and hang a circular wooden disc carved by a native Vikmordere villager over their front door. The Vikmordere villager blesses the disc and the home to ward away evil spirits and calls upon nature to protect the family. Although new arrivals scoff at this practice (calling it superstitious nonsense) they soon find out the hard way that no protection from the wild land brings evil to your doorstep. Before long even the most hardened in their stance invite a native to show them how to protect their home and family from the evils spawned from the nearby Dark Wood</p>\n<img style=\"display:block;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto\" src=\"modules/aaw-games-aventyr/Setting-images/Village-of-Rybalka-Illustration-by-Todd-Gamble.webp\" width=\"594\" height=\"355\" /></div>","markdown":""},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"sort":0,"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{"monks-enhanced-journal":{"appendix":false},"core":{"sheetClass":""}}},{"name":"Rybalkan Establishments","type":"text","_id":"zpUSPaV4mxOVvVDx","title":{"show":false,"level":1},"image":{},"text":{"format":1,"content":"<div class=\"aventyr\">\n<p class=\"s5\">Rybalkan Establishments</p>\n<h2>Rybalka City Hall</h2>\n<p>The governmental hub of the small village, this intimidating structure contains the guard barracks, mayor’s quarters, the council court, among others important facilities.</p>\n<img style=\"display:block;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto\" src=\"modules/aaw-games-aventyr/Setting-images/Rybalka-City-Hall-1-of-2.webp\" width=\"486\" height=\"800\" />\n<p>The governmental hub of the small village, this intimidating structure contains the guard barracks, records/licensing, village jail, mayor’s office, council court, and @UUID[.AMC4KKCcHuBgS853#mayor-igor-leonid]{the mayor’s} personal living quarters.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<section id=\"secret-J2CFEg1Z3ESt8owz\" class=\"secret\">\n<p>Two secret rooms are hidden within the onion domes.

Sulwotik Spirits serves up heavily intoxicating spirits made from local berries which while tasting quite sour quickly warm up a chilled weary traveler. Traditional Vikmordere foods are served here which are a mix of the Vikmordere tribal nomad diet and the Vikmordere settler staples.

A meeting place for visitors and dignitaries and place where one could always find a warm meal and a clean bed. That all ended around a year ago when the lodge mysteriously caught fire and burnt to the ground. After the suspected arson of the original lodge, one of the lodge’s former patrons- Albreck Samson decided to rebuild. Albreck, spent his life savings on the reconstruction of the old building. He wanted every detail of the new lodge to match the former establishment.</p>\n<p>The construction process was plagued by strange occurrences which always seemed to happen at night. The carpenters would return each morning to find tools missing and ladders knocked over. Although these incidents happened quite frequently the pranksters never caused any harm to the workers.

Several of the younger members of the family travel far and wide promoting their product, but most of the family is employed in and around the yard, tending the copper vats and stores of maturing alcohol in cask.</p>\n<p>The secret, as Markus Balcan just might tell you, is the spring rising in back of the yard. Its fresh, clear water imparts a distinctive pure taste to the grain alcohol the family is rightly renowned for producing.

From a distance it looks like a drop of blood on snow, hence its name. The petals of the Bloodflower can be crushed and are able to lessen the effects of intoxination with the single side effect of causing a bad breath. Winning a drinking contest versus an opponent who uses Bloodflowers in his drink is barely possible, for he won’t feel much of the effects and after a few mugs he just has to exhale in his opponent’s general direction. It not only stinks to turn all but a half-orc’s stomach, it also carries the alcoholic amounts it bound in the opponents direction.</p><p>Bloodflowers grow nearly everywhere, and certain people in Rybalka grow them in their gardens to give newcomers a special welcome in a friendly drinking contest.</p><h2>Coldflower</h2><p>The coldflower grows near the timberline. Its iceblue petals are cold to the touch. Coldflowers are liked by the remorhaz of the North, who eat them whenever possible. Even in a fight there’s a 1 in 4 chance that they eat instead of attacking. Additionally, when the remorhaz has eaten a coldflower the dreaded heat ability of the polar worms is dulled by the effect and only half as potent for an hour. Plucking a flower keeps that ability for but a day, and alchemists of the North have tried in vain to emulate the ability of the coldflower or at least keep it fresh for an extended time.</p><h2>Liverleaf</h2><p>This flower is all green, petals, leaves and stem. It blooms only a few days each year, when the sun doesn’t set. The long leaves, which are curled when the eight orange petals are open, is highly prized in @UUID[JournalEntry.QlctNkzE9injOde9.JournalEntryPage.DXD1ygEckY0JIUFB]{Klavekian} noble restaurants, for it tastes like the very expensive fresh liver of a remorhaz. Obviously it’s much less dangerous plucking that taste then getting it fresh from a most likely enraged polar worm. The leaves have to be dusted as long as they are curled, then applied to meat like a spice. A single leave can turn the taste of a chicken into the taste of liver.</p><h2>Oreadian Flower</h2><p>This plant is named after the notoriously closemouthed oreadians, for its petals are almost always closed, too. Only when its freezing cold the blue petals open and their nectar can be harvested. The oreadian flower is warm, almost hot, and attracts creatures by the warmth in order to procreate.</p><p>The nectar of one oreadian flower is enough to heal small wounds for 2-5 points of damage, but it heals the double amount of wounds from cold and, maybe due to its warmth, cures exhaustion from cold sources. Northerners are known for using magical cold to get the petals to open and to harvest them.</p><h2>Singing tree</h2><p>This tree grow sparsely on the northern edge of the @UUID[.zUmf61j380tilNZt]{Dark Wood}. Its wood is very hard, able to dull a logger’s ax, but it’s easily affected by magic like Warp Wood, which has a stronger effect on the material and can easily transfer two times the normal amount. The oddest thing about the trees are its fruits, though. They ripe in the short summer of the North, then the nutlike shells open, releasing the seed. The shells keep hanging on the tree and freeze over as early as autumn. In the winter the winds let the shells chime and sometimes even sing. Certain feys collect the shells right before they thaw in spring, before they fall down and shatter, and use them to built musical instruments.</p><h2>Winterflower</h2><p>The Winterflower is the rarest flower in the world and even a festival is named after it. It thrives in cold mountainous regions and has a reputation for growing on difficult-to-access mountain peaks and cliffs. It is the only known flower to grow through layers of snow to reach the sunlight. The one to retrieve a Winterflower and transplant it near Rybalka receives great praise from the entire village. The Wildflower is considered a blessing which protects the village from harm. Only once in the past eight years has this feat been accomplished.</p><p></p></div>","markdown":""},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"sort":0,"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}},{"name":"Fauna of the North","type":"text","_id":"BSbDtCDmgwQBw1co","title":{"show":false,"level":1},"image":{},"text":{"format":1,"content":"<div class=\"aventyr\"><p class=\"s5\">Fauna of the North</p><p>The animal life of the northern lands includes common animals big and small like yaks, vultures, rats or cave bears, but also a few less well known like those described below.</p><h2>Coppercat</h2><p>Coppercats live near the mines or with settlers who have adopted them but are rarely seen in other parts of the Rybalkan peninsula.

In settlements coppercats like iron ovens, but that may be connected to the warmth those oven produce more than to the metal.

Though it looks like a sheep from afar, the name is misleading, for the daggersheep is biologically related to the goat, not the sheep. The daggerlike horns for which it is named and its aggressiveness when cornered makes it difficult to tame, so it usually is but hunted. It has a soft wool which is easy to weave and fat flesh to offer, but tends to flee into the mountain ranges like the goat it really is. The white wool it grows when the temperatures start to fall makes it difficult to spot in the snow. Winter clothes made out of daggersheep wool are warm, but stink heavily and tend to curl when wet, which hasn’t made it very popular in the @UUID[JournalEntry.QVrlu0lTv2vFtT5P]{Klavek Kingdom}.

The valley and the lakes were carved out over two thousand years ago when a massive glacier passed through the area. In the great Serpent Lake the preferred method of travel is by boat. One must be cautious and hire an expensive and well trained navigator to steer through the maze that is Serpent Lake lest they lose their way.</p>\n<img style=\"display:block;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto\" src=\"modules/aaw-games-aventyr/Setting-images/Serpent-Lake-Map-Todd-Gamble-750x497.webp\" width=\"750\" height=\"497\" />\n<p>The Lake is named after large slimy black predatory serpents which are spotted surfacing from time to time. Legends speak of a behemoth Serpent which dwells in the deepest darkest part of the lake. The Serpent is rumored to surface and feast upon entire ships which lose their way in the confusing corridor of linked lakes of the Vikmordere Valley.</p>\n<p>The Serpent Lake is largely navigable over the whole year in most parts, only the shores freeze in winter in its southern and middle parts. Further north the lake almost totally freezes, maybe due to a lack of depth. Sages speculate about the reason for the southern and middle parts being so free of ice, hot springs in the depth being the most common explanation, though the water does indeed feel very cold. The oreads do think that there is salt in the sea, even if it is defined as freshwater, but the salt was somehow changed by the Ancestors, who were experts at earth magic and known to work with subterranean salts, as the Wall of Salt that seals Aisnley’s Lake from the Serpent Sea confirms. Rumors speak of a whole palace made of salt with something sleeping in it, waiting with inhuman patience to be awakened once more.</p>\n<p>Although the Serpent Lake has its share of dangerous sea serpents, there are of course countless other harmless animals in it also. The most common are listed in the following section.</p>\n<h2>Snowsquid</h2>\n<p>The squids in the Serpent Lake are thick-skinned and even more rubbery then their more known cousins from the south. They are as white as snow, which let to their name. The meat of snowsquids takes about two hours to cook, but is very tasty. Its not storeable without magic, though, losing its consistency after a day and developing a stench that’s not only tough to bear – Fortitude DC 15 or nauseated as long as in 50 feet distance to the squid or 100 feet downwind from it – it also tends to attract remorhazes, who seems to think of it as a rare delicacy. After three days the stench (and remorhaz-attracting) stops and the meat is no longer eatable for creatures who are not carrion crawlers.</p>\n<p>On at least two occasions there have been round wounds on a washed on @UUID[.Erya8w29cRTTJELu#wintereel]{wintereel} , causing rumors of a giant squid living somewhere in the Lake with tentacles big and strong enough to crack a ship’s hull.</p>\n<h2>Snow Water Lily</h2>\n<p>In remote corners of the Serpent Lake the snow water lily grows. Although it looks a bit withered and brittle to most observants, the kitsune of the @UUID[.zUmf61j380tilNZt]{Dark Wood} trade a fortune in for each living exemplary. It’s unknown what they need them for, but it has raised the interest of other inhabitants in recent years.</p>\n<h2>Wintereel</h2>\n<p>Some say that the name of the Serpent Lake originated from a bad perception. There are some big eels in the lake easily mistaken for a sea serpent, which may give this story credit. Biggest among those harmless freshwater eels is the wintereel, which is 3 feet long and light blue in color. It can even go on land, and many an unsuspecting witness was shocked to see such a giant fish crawling through the mud. Wintereels are not tasty and generally harmless, they avoid fishing vessels and oretransports and are ignored by the twolegged landwalkers in turn.

The crab burrows into the sands when threatened, but if unearthed can provide a healthy meal for a grown human that lasts for a day. The burrowed crabs are almost perfectly hidden though, one needs a survival check DC 20 to spot a part of their fur or shell poking up. The shells are recently coming into favor in @UUID[JournalEntry.QVrlu0lTv2vFtT5P]{Klavek }as a new form to decorate noble estates, but it’s tough to say how long this particular fashion trend will stay.</p>\n</div>","markdown":""},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"sort":0,"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{"core":{"sheetClass":""}}},{"name":"Dark Wood","type":"text","_id":"zUmf61j380tilNZt","title":{"show":false,"level":1},"image":{},"text":{"format":1,"content":"<div class=\"aventyr\"><p class=\"s5\">Dark Wood</p><p>Feared and respected by even the most powerful Vikmordere warriors, the Dark Wood is a shadowy and foreboding place. Legend speaks of a horrible deed done by evil druidic sorcerers long ago which created a rift to another world through which devils spawned. @UUID[.gu6JRkzbpzHfoNf6#ruins/crypt-of-sun-lord-kateek]{The Sun Lord Ka’Teek} of the Ancestors along with his followers battled many of the beasts and were able to seal the rift. Unfortunately the damage was already done; The devils and maybe even demons had spread into the forest now known as Dark Wood. Over hundreds of years the devils from the rift bred with the creatures of the forest creating all manner of foul monsters.</p><p>Travel through Dark Wood is extremely dangerous during the day and considered suicide if undertaken at night. Regional hunters must learn the art of the warrior or die in this unforgiving land. The strong survive while the weak become fodder for the beasts of Dark Wood.</p><h2>The three parts</h2><p>In reality the feared Dark Wood consists of three separate woods with very specific features to each of them. One part of the forest is dominated and formed by the fey, the second by the devils that were let lose here, and the third is the contested area between those two, which is partly a battleground and partly ignored, which makes that tiny part a fairly normal wood.</p><h2>The forest of the fey</h2><p>This part of the wood has many great trees with leaves as thick as barrels, the canopy woven together like a roof. In most parts the sky can’t be seen from the grounds, which was a reason for the name of the Dark Wood. Oddly enough, and surely a sign of fey intervention, there is much undergrowth, narrow gullets and bramble-infested thickets. Strange berries grow in this land, but trespassers are advised to let them be, since the fey are known to hunt down all who pluck them. Thus very little is known about them and the other fruits of the faeries. There are rumors of healing berries, berries that cure sickness or even exhaustion, and berries that are like alcohol growing on bushes. A strange land it is, reigned by a mighty dryad if rumors are to be believed.</p><p></p><h2>The forest of the devils</h2><p>Where the fiends run rampart, the forest is bleeding. That’s not literary so, most of those rumors are regarded as at least inflated, but the devils have left their marks for sure. Since it’s almost impossible to reach the devil-part of the Dark Wood without crossing through the fey-part, which is dangerous enough, information about the home of the infernals are scarce. Sometimes a devil crosses the fey-part to reach human lands, though, and the resulting battles take a heavy toll each time. The current colonization reinforcement is partly caused due to such a transgression, and the @UUID[JournalEntry.QVrlu0lTv2vFtT5P]{Klavekian} government has reacted to the demand for a whole legion of soldiers by sending a few adventurer groups. The joy of the populace of @UUID[JournalEntry.ismpCNWpGHvB1iPw]{Rybalka} is a bit less then boundless about this Klavekian decision to save money.</p><h2>The contested forest</h2><p>There are known ways through parts of the forest where the chances to avoid devils and fey are better than elsewhere. Those paths are shifting, though, depending on the latest conflicts, and adventurers are still strongly urged to keep away from the Dark Woods. There are some tough souls who live in the friendlier parts, most notably there is the Hunter’s Cabin of Cual Beartooth, but rumors tell the man who lived there has long been abducted by one of the fighting parties.</p><p></p></div>","markdown":""},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"sort":0,"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}},{"name":"The Jagged Crags","type":"text","_id":"vLMBL7x85Ve3NC06","title":{"show":false,"level":1},"image":{},"text":{"format":1,"content":"<div class=\"aventyr\">\n<p class=\"s5\">The Jagged Crags</p>\n<img style=\"display:block;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto\" src=\"modules/aaw-games-aventyr/Setting-images/Jagged-Crags.webp\" width=\"707\" height=\"435\" />\n<p>The Jagged Crags are a low lying broken mountain range on the Rybalkan Peninsula. Most of the wilderness located within the Jagged Crags has not been explored by the Rybalkans.</p>\n<p>The entrance to the Dwarf Realm, Icecrag Monastery, and the location of the rare @UUID[.w79VOo3UeUGraouv#winterflower]{Winterflower} are all rumored to be hidden in these frigid mountain peaks. The crags get their name from the jagged points that jut hundreds of feet into the air throughout the region. Climbing these small mountains is utterly suicidal and unnecessary. There is a reason why this particular region has not been explored.</p>\n<p>The Jagged Crags are dangerous enough for their terrain, but a strange weather phenomenon makes them even more hazardous. During autumn and spring the winds are gusting, which means that periods of calm breezes, lasting for 3d10 minutes, are followed by short busts of strong wind, lasting for 1d10 minutes and reaching up to 50 mph. During the onset of later phases those with strength 13 or less must make successful Strength checks DC 7 to not fall prone, and movement during strong winds is halved. The animal life of the Jagged Crags has adapted to these weather conditions and is thus not affected. Skilled mountaineers do get signs from this though. With a successful Survival check DC 12 they notice seemingly odd animal behavior like birds landing or soaring high, animals burrowing into the earth or snow and even @UUID[.w79VOo3UeUGraouv#oreadian-flower]{oreadean flowers} flattening themselves. Many a would-be-mountaineer was blown from a ledge by a gusting wind, never to be seen again.</p>\n<p>In winter the Jagged Crags are stormy, with blizzards raging for 2d6 hours before a calm but still frosty breeze replaces them. Those calm phases are also longer and can last from a few hours to whole days. With a storm comes a great amount of snow, restricting vision to 10 feet, be it normal, lowlight- or darkvision. The @UUID[.BSbDtCDmgwQBw1co#daggersheep]{daggersheep} still have good movement rates under those condition, letting sages speculate that they have a strange additional sense of orientation.</p>\n<p>In summer the Jagged Crags do explode with life. The snow never leaves the mountain tops entirely, but whole summits are red as blood with blooming @UUID[.w79VOo3UeUGraouv#bloodflower]{bloodflowers}. In lower regions the snow does melt, creating the summer flows through ragged ravines. Oreads are sometimes seen to travel far and wide, collecting the water for the spirits they are supposed to carry. @UUID[JournalEntry.QlctNkzE9injOde9.JournalEntryPage.t4LZuyNruvzneOHD]{Dwarves} also prefer to collect the cold waters, but they do it for their distillery operations. Since those summerflows that flow through the @UUID[.zUmf61j380tilNZt]{Dark Wood} are a preferred home for water nymphs and other feys, sages do agree that there is something special about the flows of summer, but as of now no one seems to have a clue about the details.</p>\n<p>While mountaineering in the Jagged Crags is best done in summer, many agree that it is best not done at all. Even in summer the mornings can be below freezing, but temperatures can rise to almost hot conditions within hours. Wind is between calm and light, but can reach 40 mph occasionally and carry heavy rains, which lower perception to 10 feet except for the aforementioned daggersheeps. During a summer storm, which can last from 15 minutes to an hour (roll 1d4 for 15-minutes increments), there is a chance of 70% per increment that 1d4 lightning bolt strikes near an adventuring party. Determine the victims randomly, but double the chances for members in heavy iron armor or with a pole weapon. Each bolt deals 3d10 points of electricity damage, a reflex save halves that damage. Daggersheep are not immune against this, its not unusal to find a cooked daggersheep somewhere on the Crags in summer. If you saw off a daggerlike horn of such a sheep, you can use it three times as a dagger with the shock special ability (extra 1d6 points of electricity damage), but this also affects the wielder. The lightning is stored for up to three weeks or until spend, whichever comes faster. Harvesting a daggersheep horn deals 1d8 of electricity damage unless protected. This doesn’t count against the shock special ability. A daggersheep horndagger can be reloaded with lightning bolt as by the rules.</p>\n</div>","markdown":""},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"sort":0,"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{"core":{"sheetClass":""}}},{"name":"Rybalka-NPCs","type":"text","_id":"AMC4KKCcHuBgS853","title":{"show":false,"level":1},"image":{},"text":{"format":1,"content":"<div class=\"aventyr\">\n<p class=\"s5\">Rybalka-NPCs</p>\n<h2>Government</h2>\n<p><strong>@UUID[.AMC4KKCcHuBgS853#mayor-igor-leonid]{Mayor Igor Leonid}</strong> – Igor Leonid is the Mayor of @UUID[JournalEntry.ismpCNWpGHvB1iPw]{Rybalka} and originally hails from @UUID[JournalEntry.QVrlu0lTv2vFtT5P.JournalEntryPage.dwAJ5Jtc6ii8zQoh]{Mohkba}, capital city of the @UUID[JournalEntry.QVrlu0lTv2vFtT5P]{Klavek Kingdom}.</p>\n<p><strong>@UUID[.AMC4KKCcHuBgS853#village-guard]{Village Guard}</strong> – The 10 guards who protect the fishing village of Rybalka from the dangers of the wilderness.</p>\n<p><strong>@UUID[.AMC4KKCcHuBgS853#wvolf]{Wvolf of the Village Guard}</strong> – Rybalkan resident long before the Klavek Kingdom ousted the @UUID[JournalEntry.QlctNkzE9injOde9.JournalEntryPage.I4CpK8rTs0HgD7hW]{Vikmordere}.

In his free time, Igor frequents the @UUID[.zpUSPaV4mxOVvVDx#thirsty-serpent-tavern]{Thirsty Serpent Tavern} where the patrons revel in his boisterous, booming singing voice as he leads them in traditional Klavekian songs. He has been known to raise the morale to such great heights that patrons of the tavern often volunteer for guard duty. Rumors persist of a song which the mayor sang upon coming to Rybalka which convinced twenty young men to sign up and serve in the Klavekian military.</p>\n<p>Despite his rough and tumble nature, Igor Leonid upholds the strict laws of the Klavek Kingdom in this cold and forsaken outpost on the edge of Vikmordere territory.</p>\n<p>After defeating the Vikmordere in a bloody war, the village of Rybalka was established and Igor was sent to hold the peace. Igor has a fine record of making peace out of hostility in the Klavek Kingdom and will perform the same way here. He has no fear of battle but prefers negotiation if at all possible. When it comes to negotiation, Igor’s soft-spot is homemade bread pudding, those in the know can exploit this and win his heart by tempting his gluttonous belly.</p>\n<p>The Klavekian Monarchy has assigned Mayor Igor Leonid thirty Klavekian Soldiers which patrol a 15-mile radius around Rybalka.</p>\n<p>Ten Rybalkan soldiers (dubbed the @UUID[.AMC4KKCcHuBgS853#village-guard]{Village Guard} by the locals) have also been appointed to Rybalka under the direct leadership of Mayor Igor Leonid.

He keeps his past life a secret and speaks only when spoken to.</p>\n<h3>Barrett Colvek</h3>\n<p>Barrett is a foolhardy adventurer type who drinks too much and is always late for his shifts. He loves his job, but is quite distracted.</p>\n<h3>Derann the Orphan</h3>\n<p>Derann is someone who you would want at your back. He is the first to warn others of danger and is always looking out for the best interests of the Klavek Kingdom.</p>\n<h3>Jells</h3>\n<p>Jells is a roguish type who was once a pickpocket but decided to change his ways and become a Klavekian Guard. The catalyst for this change was his brother’s death at the hands of the Vikmordere during one of their many raids on the Klavek Kingdom.</p>\n<h3>Lexandor Hyrule III</h3>\n<p>Following in his father’s footsteps, Lexandor is noble, arrogant, and rude. Lexandor spends much of his time studying, flaunting his family’s wealth and notoriety, and flirting with women at the local tavern.</p>\n<h3>Nolan Brenweld</h3>\n<p>Nolan comes from a noble family, but unlike Lexandor does not flaunt it. Nolan prefers to keep to himself and works on improving his skills as a warrior. @UUID[.AMC4KKCcHuBgS853#mayor-igor-leonid]{The mayor} has trusted both Nolan and @UUID[.AMC4KKCcHuBgS853#wvolf]{Wolf} with secret missions from time to time and both men are in line for a promotion.</p>\n<h3>Olav Gyutok</h3>\n<p>Olav is a huge man who wades into battle with joy. He loves to crush skulls and make mince-meat of his enemies. Olav has been a guard for over 10 years and plans on defending the Klavek Kingdom until he can no longer heft a sword.</p>\n<h3>Perry Yefim</h3>\n<p>A naturally curious young lad, Perry prefers to stay indoors where it is warm. Perry most times chooses to perform clerical duties while working on his own novel about life on the edge of the untamed wilderness. He performs his rounds quickly and then returns to his writings, hoping to publish a book in the next few years.</p>\n<h3>Valerius Untoo</h3>\n<p>Valerius comes from a family of mages, thus he is the black sheep but does not mind. He has a bit of an inferiority complex, but does a satisfactory job of defending the village. Valerius is having an affair with a local young woman. If the woman’s husband was to find out he would most likely attempt to kill Valerius. Thus, Valerius keeps his “nightly appointments” to himself.</p>\n<h3>Wvolf</h3>\n<p> </p>\n<img style=\"float:right;margin:0px 15px 15px 0px;border:0px\" title src=\"modules/aaw-games-aventyr/Setting-images/Wvolf.webp\" width=\"250\" height=\"323\" />\n<p>Wvolf lived in this region long before the Klavek Kingdom ousted the Vikmordere from Rybalka.

The location and importance of these areas have not been disclosed to the general public. Official legal documents have been signed and the Klavek Kingdom must uphold this agreement as long as the Klavekian Monarchy holds power in the Vikmordere Valley.</p>\n<p>The mayor has trusted both @UUID[.AMC4KKCcHuBgS853#nolan-brenweld]{Nolan} and Wvolf of the Village Guard with secret missions from time to time. Both men are in line for a promotion.</p>\n<p>It seems that no matter how many years pass Wvolf does not seem to age. This causes many of the villagers to question Wvolf’s lineage. He ignores such gossip, preferring to focus instead on his role in this village. Wvolf keeps to himself and is rarely caught off guard, especially in the wilderness. When he must fight he does so from a distance using his longbow. In close quarters he dual wields two magical shortswords with maniacal fury. Wvolf is a formidable opponent and is rarely bested.</p>\n<h2>The Black Bears</h2>\n<p>The Black Bears are comprised of young yet seasoned veterans of the Klavekian Military who assisted in taking Rybalka from the hands of the Vikmordere. They are foul-mouthed, fearless brutes who until recently were the only force available for hire on the Rybalkan Peninsula.

Uncle Siescor saw a strength and wisdom in the young Juriendor that his father had not. He urged him to take the oath to the God of War and become a member of the church.</p>\n<p>Juriendor swore to make a difference in the world and fight for truth and justice wherever the winds of change blew strongest. Juriendor made a difference wherever he went, solving problems using wise and insightful diplomacy. When diplomacy failed, the God of War summoned courage and strength within Juriendor’s very being which he in turn bestowed upon the other priests. Juriendor proved himself in the church, at the negotiation table, and on the field of battle. After many grueling combats and tactical victories, Juriendor was promoted to High Priest of the God of War.</p>\n<p>A progressive force in a cold and dangerous world, Juriendor has been placed on the frontier of civilization in his first position as High Priest of the God of War at the Rybalka Temple.</p>\n<p>High Priest Juriendor preaches a daily sermon at the Rybalka Temple each morning immediately after sunrise. His six acolytes and two priests assist townsfolk with minor matters, while High Priest Juriendor handles larger religious and moral matters.

Even the sage’s closest associates do not know his true name.</p>\n<p><strong>History:</strong> Yuri Statel began his career at a young age as a Cavalier serving the Lion Brigade of King Tokolvor XII. While serving his country in the Great War Yuri was captured by the enemy. They tortured him for over a year before he was rescued by his countrymen. No one knows exactly what happened in that enemy dungeon, but Yuri was changed forever.</p>\n<p>After this event, he returned to the Klavek Capitol of Mohkba. Seeking an audience with King Tokolvor Klavek XII’s son the Prince, he petitioned to become a personal historian of the Klavek Kingdom. During his time serving Prince Klavek, his father King Klavek was mysteriously poisoned. The murderer was never found and Prince Tokolvor Klavek became the current king, King Tokolvor Klavek XIII. (This knowledge is known only to historians serving the monarchy or those Klavekian soldiers old enough to remember such events.

Secondly, Quorron is an outcast and was banished from his homeland after killing his uncle in a dispute over rights to the family forge.</p>\n</section>\n<p>Quorron has never cared for politics or gossip and believes that “might makes right.” This is why he holds no qualms over the new claim-holders on Rybalka. The Klavekians defeated the Vikmordere (Quorron’s former employers) with brute force. Therefore, with Quorron’s “might makes right” philosophy, the Klavekians have every right to own this land.</p>\n<p>When dealing with customers Quorron is short and to the point, ignoring small talk entirely and working tirelessly to appease his clients.</p>\n<h3>Quorron’s Quests</h3>\n<p>Quorron sometimes hires trustworthy adventurers and mercenaries to perform various quests which typically have something to do with ore, metal, crafting techniques, or his customers’ orders. He is short and to the point when offering up a quest and doesn’t like a lot of questions.</p>\n<h2>Fin Starling</h2>\n<p> </p>\n<img style=\"float:right;margin:0px 15px 15px 0px;border:0px\" title src=\"modules/aaw-games-aventyr/Setting-images/Fin-Starling.webp\" width=\"256\" height=\"423\" />\n<p>Fin Starling owns the @UUID[.zpUSPaV4mxOVvVDx#thirsty-serpent-tavern]{Thirsty Serpent Tavern} and has done so ever since his father passed away last winter.</p>\n<p>A semi-retired adventurer in his late twenties, Fin spent much of his youth traveling the world and getting in (and out of) tight spots. A swashbuckler and “Jack of all trades, master of none”, Fin sometimes made his living in illegitimate ways. He has visited almost every single city, town, and village along the coast of the Klavek Homeland and has even traveled to a few remote islands. He loves to tell tales of his journeys but never speaks of his travels outside the Klavek Kingdom; Fin fears reprisal from the monarchy for “unauthorized &amp; undocumented entry into enemy territory” as well as the crime of “fraternizing with the enemy” as a possible alternative charge.</p>\n<p>Fin is a real ladies man and enjoys flirting and teasing women all the way to the bedroom. Despite this fact, he prefers to stay single. In the past when a woman would get too close, he would pick up and leave town in the blink of an eye. Only time will tell how Fin will handle such an affair when his commitment to the family tavern keeps him grounded in Rybalka.</p>\n<p>Thus far Fin has turned down all advances by @UUID[.AMC4KKCcHuBgS853#claudette-vanderbilt]{Claudette Vanderbilt}. This thoroughly confuses her given her special nature for attracting men. Luckily for Fin he wears a magical ring which protects him from Claudette’s powers. He found the ring in a treasure horde a few years ago but is oblivious to both the nature of the ring and Claudette’s evil powers.</p>\n<p>Since taking over the Thirsty Serpent Tavern from his deceased father, Fin has grown bored and does his best to please patrons while putting on a show to keep himself entertained. He longs to go adventuring again and has thought about selling the tavern; he is prevented from doing so by a promise made to his dying father. Before his father passed away, Fin pledged that he would keep the family business alive. Fin craves his freedom more than anything else and meanwhile gathers any tales of treasure or adventure he can get his hands on.</p>\n<h2>Landore Bugg</h2>\n<p>Landore Bugg is a strange fellow who bundles up in tattered and stained clothing. He meanders around town performing menial maintenance work on the village. Landore is paid by Klavek Kingdom.</p>\n<p>Landore owns a small home in Rybalka which he calls “@UUID[.zpUSPaV4mxOVvVDx#bugg-inn]{Bugg Inn}“. This so-called-inn is packed full of random useless junk that Landore picks up around town while performing work. There are two rooms at the inn which have been cleared out for visitors to rent which helps Landore pay to acquire more junk. Sometimes he makes his way out to Klavekian work sites to collect scrap metal and haul it back to his place to dump in the front yard.</p>\n<p>Landore is constantly chewing and spitting tobacco and stinks horribly of foul body odor.</p>\n<p>Most of the townsfolk steer clear of Landore not wishing to find themselves in a never-ending, one-sided conversation about Landore’s latest acquisition.</p>\n<h2>Sulwotik</h2>\n<p> </p>\n<img style=\"float:right;margin:0px 15px 15px 0px;border:0px\" title src=\"modules/aaw-games-aventyr/Setting-images/Sulwotik.webp\" width=\"201\" height=\"391\" />\n<p>Sulwotik owns the makeshift bar dubbed @UUID[.zpUSPaV4mxOVvVDx#sulwotiks-spirits]{Sulwotik’s Spirits} by the locals.</p>\n<p>Sulwotik was originally a tribal shaman of a large Vikmordere tribe but was told by the @UUID[JournalEntry.dOJJ8mRNTPtoihmF.JournalEntryPage.l22xqVPei8b2u04P]{Ancestor Spirit} to settle here at the lakeside village. When Sulwotik first came to the village it was full of lake craftsmen, tribal fishermen, and woodworkers all of the Ancestor People lineage. Sulwotik was quickly welcomed into their society and given the home of a man who had recently perished due to a serpent attack while fishing the Serpent Lake.</p>\n<p>Keeping his shamanistic rituals paramount, Sulwotik needed to find a way to make a living so that he could purchase food and wood in this new strange life. Thus, he learned the art of distillation and shared his intoxicating beverages with the locals who came to visit his home often. Eventually, his home began to change into a gathering place for the locals to drink and talk. It has existed this way ever since.</p>\n<p>The appeal of a down to earth home style atmosphere with fine stiff drinks greatly appeals to the Rybalkan soldiers. Sulwotik uses the opportunity to slowly introduce them to the culture of the Vikmordere and show them that his people are not the evil demons the Klavekian Monarchy makes them out to be. He does this very cautiously over dozens of visits and tests the waters with each Rybalkan soldier. Sulwotik is a wise man and knows that if his true nature is ever discovered he will most likely be tortured, interrogated, and possibly killed.</p>\n<p>Sulwotik sees the invasion of the Klavek Kingdom as a sign of change which the Ancestor Spirit told him could not be avoided. Now that the Klavekians have arrived it is up to Sulwotik to show them the ways of the forest, the mountain, the lake and the eagle, the beaver, and the bear. Nature is one with life and the Ancestor Spirit drives Sulwotik in all that he does. Sulwotik has erected all of the totem poles throughout Rybalka to fend off evil and give thanks to the Ancestor Spirit and Mother Nature. Many Klaveks have chopped them down and burned them for firewood just to spite Sulwotik.</p>\n<p>For every totem pole burnt, Sulwotik begins carving two more to replace it.</p>\n<section id=\"secret-E9cbnfdL0yaQ2fSF\" class=\"secret\">\n<p>Should the village ever come under attack Sulwotik may summon the Ancestor Spirit to imbue one of his totem poles with spiritual energy transforming it into a Totem Golem to protect the villagers.</p>\n</section>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>Claudette Vanderbilt</h2>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Claudette Vanderbilt is a widow in her mid 40’s with a dark secret.</p>\n<p>Claudette drapes her shapely body in fine black evening gowns, wearing enough jewelry to enhance her aesthetic appearance, but not so much as to appear gaudy. She can usually be found at the @UUID[.zpUSPaV4mxOVvVDx#thirsty-serpent-tavern]{Thirsty Serpent Tavern}, flirting with men half her age. She is quite confident and very charismatic which sometimes scores her a handsome man for the evening. She will only take home visitors to the village and never a resident. The townsfolk often jest about how scary she must look naked since none of her male suitors ever return to town again. Fact is, her suitors are never seen or heard from by anyone, ever.</p>\n<p>Claudette is a widow who has continued along in life just fine without her husband whom she found quite irritating. He was always barking orders at her and putting her down. Eventually Claudette grew tired of the orders and dropped some Laungoroot poison in his favorite rabbit stew. The meal was his last and she has lived happily in solitude ever since.</p>\n<section id=\"secret-Y2yroTkaz4ydE2ht\" class=\"secret\">\n<p>Although quite deranged, Claudette is not insane. She has found great pleasure in forging her own path in the world.</p>\n<p>Many years ago while cleaning the cellar, Claudette found a hidden compartment in the wall. Within the compartment rested the mysterious Tome of Nabid (cursed) and an ancient dagger with runes upon the blade known as the Dagger of Nabid (cursed). The large tome appeared quite ancient with a strange symbol burned into the stitched leather cover. Claudette kept the book hidden from her husband and studied the writings while he was out fishing each day. The tome taught her how to make the poison which she later used to kill him and regain the control he had taken from her the day they were wed. Little does Claudette know, but the tome and dagger are cursed and over time are slowly changing her into a Sea Hag. The change has occurred so gradually that Claudette has no recollection of how or why this happened. By drinking fresh blood drawn by the cursed dagger Claudette is able to keep her attractive appearance and alluring charisma.</p>\n<p>When Claudette brings male suitors to her home, she first tricks them by stripping them naked and tying them to her bed posts. She then proceeds to torture them whilst drinking their blood. If they yield and completely give up hope, she is able to transform them into rats using a witchcraft spell and a very sinister potion, both of which were learned from the evil cursed tome. In this state the creatures cannot remember their former life and must obey Claudette’s orders, understanding but unable to communicate or resist in any way. If one of her suitors fails to yield to her evil ways, she drinks their blood until they pass out and die, then carves up their corpse with the cursed dagger, feeding it to the other rats who take refuge in the cellar and tunnels below.</p>\n<p>Claudette’s ultimate goal is unknown even to her, but if she continues to grow in power and people keep disappearing, she will eventually be found out and will have to retreat to the depths of the Serpent Lake or face a traditional village mob lynching.</p>\n</section>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>Beatrice Sweet</h2>\n<p>Beatrice Sweet is @UUID[.AMC4KKCcHuBgS853#terrance-sweet]{Terrance Sweet’s} wife. Beatrice is in her late 60’s and constantly dreams of her four children who left this land years ago to marry and start families of their own.</p>\n<p>The children leaving has left the elderly couple alone in their large home.</p>\n<p>These days, Beatrice sits quietly knitting and rocking back in forth in her chair all day long by the fire, staring out at the cold lake water lapping at the shore. Every once in a while she gently sets down her needles and yarn and gazes out at the moon as if she were homesick and dreaming of another place she would rather be. She never speaks anymore and has fallen into a deep depression. Her husband Terrance has grown weary of spending time around her. He leaves her to her work and the trail of yarn turns into a long blanket which wanders over her lap, her legs, onto the floor and out into the living room, filling the entire room. When she runs out of one color she picks up another off the mantle and continues to add to the blanket. The blanket is a rainbow of dark and dreary colors which is drowning the living room and the life Terrance and Beatrice once had.</p>\n<h2>Terrance Sweet</h2>\n<p>Terrance is a gruff old man in his 60’s who hails from the old school. He is a fisherman and once slung nets and line for a living to raise his four children.</p>\n<p>The children have all since grown up and moved away, leaving Terrance alone with his wife @UUID[.AMC4KKCcHuBgS853#beatrice-sweet]{Beatrice} who has lost her mind in her old age. She sits quietly knitting and rocking back in forth in her chair all day long by the fire, staring out at the cold lake water lapping at the shore. She never speaks and Terrance has grown weary of spending time with her.</p>\n<p>Terrance spends most of his time outside in his cold shop at his workbench carving wood and repairing old fishing poles and nets. He smokes a pipe he carved himself, and wears an old flat cap to cover his bald spot. The wisps of wavy hair that remain cascade down grasping out at his shoulders. When it grows too long he pulls out a mirror and gives himself a trim. Terrance hums old fishing tunes as he works carving wood and once per evening, goes out on the lake in his old skiff to toss in a line and catch dinner.</p>\n<h2>Cual Beartooth</h2>\n<p> </p>\n<img style=\"float:right;margin:0px 15px 15px 0px;border:0px\" title src=\"modules/aaw-games-aventyr/Setting-images/Cual-Beartooth.webp\" width=\"232\" height=\"350\" />\n<p>Cual Beartooth is the only living man to have taken up residence in the horrific @UUID[.gu6JRkzbpzHfoNf6#dark-wood]{Dark Wood} and survived. His path was not an easy one, and Cual has the physical, mental, and emotional scars to prove it.</p>\n<p>Although he rarely speaks of it, Cual originally hails from the Klavek Homeland. Rybalkans know very little about Cual’s past and he prefers it that way. He migrated to this area long before the Klavekians ousted Rybalka from the Vikmordere, and is an old timer to the Vikmordere Valley. The Vikmordere granted him passage after he bested their strongest warriors in challenges of strength and courage and outsmarted the wisest and most knowledgeable of their shamans.</p>\n<p>After just one week upon arriving in the region, Cual gathered supplies and set up camp in the Dark Wood. On the first night, he was attacked by a horde of vicious monsters and was nearly slain. He would have died were it not for an onslaught of undead headless druidic sorcerers that arrived in order to battle the monsters and subsequently give chase.</p>\n<p>After the monsters and their undead pursuers fled his camp, he heard more creatures closing in on his location. As he began to bleed to death, Cual crawled across the forest floor looking for shelter.</p>\n<p>He finally found a small cave which turned out to be the den of a great bear. The massive bear awoke and grabbed Cual’s body in its great maw. Cual beat at the bear’s mouth and struggled to break free. After an intense struggle, Cual loosened a tooth of the bear and ripped it clean from the jaw of the great beast. Using the tooth as a dagger Cual stabbed again and again at the bear’s face, doing anything he could to stop the maw from crushing his already mangled body. After a horrific struggle, Cual was finally able to plunge the dagger deep enough into an eye socket and wedge it into the beast’s brain. The great bear dropped his limp body and they collapsed together in death, but Cual would not die.</p>\n<p>He awoke the next morning, miraculously still alive and barely clinging to his mortal life. Cual used every ounce of strength within his being and body to lift his head and crawl out of the cave. He managed to find a small stream where he drank but feared the water would leak through the dozens of puncture holes covering his body.</p>\n<p>Amazingly, the water was enough for Cual to gather his strength and return to camp. It was there that he found the body of a slain devil. The devil wore magical gear and armor which Cual plundered. Cual found a small vial containing a sweet smelling water. Since he wouldn’t live long in his current state Cual took a chance and downed content of the vial. Miraculously the magical water closed most of his wounds and brought strength and vigor back to his limbs. He quickly grabbed the rest of the devil’s gear including a huge double-bladed axe which felt as light as a feather.</p>\n<p>There were many other restless nights but with the help of the devil’s magical gear and Featheraxe (as Cual named his double-bladed beauty), he survived and in a way prospered in a forbidden land where no other man dared tread.</p>\n<p>@UUID[.gu6JRkzbpzHfoNf6#hunters-cabin]{Cual’s cabin} is a refuge for Klavekian and Vikmordere alike and a place where both are welcome but neither enemies.

The tree growth at the southern border of Edhellond with the Scorchlands is limited due to the lack of usable nutrients in the soil. The eastern border of the Silent Forest is relatively clear of tree growth, as these areas have been cultivated for crops.</p>\n<p>Isolationist, militant, xenophobic, and suspicious, almost nothing is known about the Elves of Edhellond, known to non-Elves as the Silent Forest. Non-Elves are unwelcome and those that refuse to leave are found, eventually, outside the Forest, their bodies savaged and left as a warning to others.</p>\n<p>Non-Elves do not know why the denizens of the Silent Forest have separated themselves from the rest of the world and those few Elves who are caught outside the forest will not answers questions about their history or their homeland even under threat of death. Only the most dire of circumstances will make an Elf divulge information.</p>\n<h1>History</h1>\n<p> </p>\n<img style=\"float:left;margin:0px 15px 15px 0px;border:0px\" src=\"modules/aaw-games-aventyr/Setting-images/Sabriel2.webp\" width=\"256\" height=\"363\" />\n<p>The Elves believe that almost at the Prime Event of the universe, light was created and it spread throughout the heavens, bringing life to countless worlds. As the universe attempted to create balance, darkness was created as well. They believe that these two equal and opposing forces were found in @UUID[JournalEntry.dOJJ8mRNTPtoihmF.JournalEntryPage.leuKpASroHy7r6sn]{Naraneus}, who became the Dark Goddess of the Drow, and her twin sister @UUID[JournalEntry.dOJJ8mRNTPtoihmF.JournalEntryPage.oyFVdicDq8mbjOWw]{Naneth}, who would become the Mother Goddess of the Elves.</p>\n<p>Many centuries ago, when the Silent Forest was still relatively young, the surface Elves and what would become known as the @UUID[JournalEntry.QlctNkzE9injOde9.JournalEntryPage.8HyVcZ70eyhwNJsu]{Drow} lived together, but their increasing numbers were soon going to overwhelm what the forest could provide. Rather than the different factions descending into violence, their deities did in their stead.</p>\n<p>According to the surface Elves, Naraneus began a campaign of war against her sister that was so continuous and all-consuming that when the now-divided groups came to blows, Naraneus ignored the pleas of the Drow to concentrate on her own battles. The Drow, in desperation, turned to other gods, but they didn’t answer the Drow either. The Elves showed no quarter as the Drow had begun the fight and the Drow were forced to flee. The Drow call this The Dismissal. The Elves call it The Banishing.</p>\n<p>After nearly a thousand years, Naraneus broke off her war with Naneth and returned to the Drow, teaching them of the darkness that she represented. Naneth took time to reflect upon the activities of the past thousand years and began teaching her priests and priestesses that if the Elves could not trust their own kin, they couldn’t trust anyone outside their kin.</p>\n<p>Trade relations with the @UUID[JournalEntry.QlctNkzE9injOde9.JournalEntryPage.t4LZuyNruvzneOHD]{Dwarf}, @UUID[JournalEntry.QlctNkzE9injOde9.JournalEntryPage.myrc4omqUaiD3RKZ]{Halfling}, and @UUID[JournalEntry.QlctNkzE9injOde9.JournalEntryPage.lMtTJxWecu1ISdP0]{Gnomes} suddenly ceased. There was no response from envoys sent to the Elves. Even the Orcs had no relations with the Elves. The entire society retreated into Edhellond, turning solely to hunting and agriculture and forsaking any trade with any other races.</p>\n<p>At first, diplomats from various races were simply rebuffed and told to leave the forest with very little information. As the other races sent bolder envoys to the Silent Forest, the envoys returned with even less information and more threats to stay out of Edhellond. Eventually, they stopped returning altogether.</p>\n<p>Knowing that trusting the other races was all but impossible, but understanding that knowledge of the other races activities was important, Patriarch Celeion Taltaur sent some spies to infiltrate the Human and Orc communities and others to keep tabs on the other races. These spies are trained in the art of disguise and use every magical means available to them to remain hidden. These spies are replaced every few years, but they remain hidden within those communities and their information is invaluable.</p>\n<h1>Government</h1>\n<p>Edhellond is a theocracy, ruled by a Matriarch or Patriarch. When the current ruler dies, every Cleric, Paladin, and Monk dedicated to @UUID[JournalEntry.dOJJ8mRNTPtoihmF.JournalEntryPage.oyFVdicDq8mbjOWw]{Naneth} goes into a weeklong meditation. Upon awaking, the member of the clergy that can perform a miracle determined to be from Naneth herself becomes the new Matriarch or Patriarch.</p>\n<p>At the time the Matriarch or Patriarch assumes the throne, they select what is called the Warden. Upon death of the Matriarch or Patriarch, the Warden takes control of the throne until a miracle is produced.</p>\n<p>The current leader, Haewel Birron, became the Matriarch when she brought rain to the fields of crops that border the eastern edge of the forest in a time of great drought. This was unusual because the rain came from inside the forest instead of from the sky. She is married to @UUID[.segjH3vhBwQjfdag#arfindiel]{Arfindiel}, an extremely gifted metalsmith who learned the trade from his ancestors, who learned from the @UUID[JournalEntry.QlctNkzE9injOde9.JournalEntryPage.t4LZuyNruvzneOHD]{Dwarf} before the Banishing.</p>\n<p>A Cleric of Naneth who could have become the Matriarch or Patriarch advises the ruler. The current advisor is @UUID[.segjH3vhBwQjfdag#erilanwen,-advisor-to-the-matriarch]{Erilanwen}, a militaristic Cleric of Maethor Naneth .</p>\n<p>Every Matriarch or Patriarch keeps a Wizard or Sorcerer on his or her staff as well. This spellcaster is usually chosen by the advisor, but may be chosen by the ruler. The current spellcaster is @UUID[.segjH3vhBwQjfdag#tacaeon]{Tacaeon}.</p>\n<h1>Cities</h1>\n<p>There are no cities in Edhellond, though there are the remnants of some outposts that lay in ruins. The Elves learned early on that building structures, such as guard posts or even villages simply gives other races a place to establish a stronghold within the Silent Forest. There are hundreds of campgrounds that are used by the patrols within the Forest, but they contain no buildings and usually only a firepit and a place to pitch a tent if needed.</p>\n<h1>Capital</h1>\n<p>There is no capital, per se, of Edhellond. The closest approximation to a capital is Tal (pronounced tahl), which is a shrine to Naneth that is in the middle of Edhellond. Elven legend states that Naneth appeared to Sabarwen Haeelwa, the first Matriarch of the Elves, and told Sabarwen to begin settling an area around a extremely large maple tree. This area is surrounded by a group of treants who have sworn loyalty to the position of the Matriarch or Patriarch.</p>\n<h1>Patrols</h1>\n<p>Specific patrols watch the borders between Edhellond and the @UUID[Compendium.Aventyr-Campaign-Setting.aventyr-campaign.QVrlu0lTv2vFtT5P]{Klavek Kingdom} to the north, the Scorched Lands to the south, and the uncharted territories to the west. General patrols move throughout Edhellond on a regular basis.</p>\n<p>Patrols through Edhellond consist of roughly a dozen warriors and contains at least one individual proficient in a few languages or that has the ability to cast the tongues spell. These patrols also keep a sharp eye out for any type of shape changing magic for something they can use to help their spies stay hidden.</p>\n<p>Spellcasters in these patrols refrain from large, flashy spells, such as lightning bolt, and prefer to use spells like detect thoughts, cause fear, and most use mind-controlling magic to get invaders to leave and not return. They also use spells that alter memories to get invaders to forget anything they have seen, as well as certain psychoactive fungi that are grown near the sea where Edhellond borders the Scorched Lands.</p>\n<p>Each patrol group has two members who carry horns, which are blown in the event of combat. This sound attracts Elves within hearing range. Two separate members of the party carry scrolls of sending, one of which is used at the same time the horns are blown. This scroll is used to contact the Matriarch and inform her of what is occurring, along with approximate position and the number of enemies.</p>\n<p>When the Matriarch receives a sending, she alerts the @UUID[.segjH3vhBwQjfdag#the-teu-circa-(the-silver-sickles)]{Teu Circa, the Silver Sickles}. If the number of enemies is large or battle turns quickly against the defenders, the Sickles will ride into battle upon permanently hasted dire boars. Each member of the Sickles wears a ring of sending to allow constant communication between the group and the Matriarch.</p>\n<h2>The Teu Circa (The Silver Sickles)</h2>\n<p>The Teu Circa are the personal bodyguards for the Matriarch and the internal police force for Edhellond. This group is made up of eleven members, one of each class. The leader of the Sickles, @UUID[.segjH3vhBwQjfdag#tanna,-leader-of-the-tau-circa]{Tanna }in this case, is always a Paladin of @UUID[JournalEntry.dOJJ8mRNTPtoihmF.JournalEntryPage.oyFVdicDq8mbjOWw]{Naneth}.</p>\n<p>Each member of the Teu Circa owns a dire boar that that member raises from the birth of the boar to be a steed and companion. These boars are permanently hasted and have no fear of carrying their rider into battle. Under no circumstances will a boar of the Sickles carry any other rider.</p>\n<p>Both boars and Sickles serve the Elven ruler until death.</p>\n<h1>Religion</h1>\n<p>Elves are monotheistic, worshipping a dual goddess, @UUID[JournalEntry.dOJJ8mRNTPtoihmF.JournalEntryPage.oyFVdicDq8mbjOWw]{Naneth}. Naneth has two faces that Elves will pray to, depending on their class or their situation. Naneth represents the warming, protective, maternal side of light as Asaya Naneth, the Leaf Mother, while also representing the harsh, destructive side of light as Maethor Naneth, the Warrior Mother.</p>\n<p>Death in Edhellond is a somber event. As the Elves consider each other to be family, regardless of lineage, a death is almost always mourned forest wide. A death in Edhellond is treated with respect, but more so if the deceased was a member of the @UUID[.segjH3vhBwQjfdag#the-teu-circa-(the-silver-sickles)]{Teu Circa} or an important member of Elven society. The most respect is reserved for the Matriarch or Patriarch.</p>\n<p>The funereal rite of the Elves is called “returning to Mother.” It involves wrapping the deceased in leaves, having the body blessed by the Matriarch or Patriarch, and buried beneath the roots of a tree. This allows the body’s decomposition to assist the tree in growing, as the chemicals of the body are taken up by the tree.</p>\n<p>When warfare was more common, the rite of blessing and burial was performed by the closest cleric or paladin of Naneth. As the clerics and paladins did not carry enough leaves to wrap bodies in, they pinned a single leaf to the garments of the deceased and buried them below he nearest tree when time permitted.</p>\n<h1>Ruler</h1>\n<p>The current Matriarch of the Elves of the Silent Forest is Haewel Birron. As per Elven custom, when the previous rule, Patriarch Umiel Firwen, passed away, Haewel joined the other clerics, paladins, and monks in trying to bring forth a miracle to see whom the new leader would be. Haewel managed to conjure rain to bring water to the crops that border the eastern edge of the Silent Forest, but this rain came from inside the forest instead of the sky, marking her as the new ruler of Edhellond. What makes her more unusual is that she is just past middle age, making her the youngest Matriarch in recorded Elven history.</p>\n<p>She is a potent healer, but tempers her healing abilities with common sense; if you are hurt during battle, she is the first to offer aid. However, if your injuries are your own doing from lack of forethought, she will have one of her clerics heal the most grievous wound, but leave the rest to heal on its own.</p>\n<p>Matriarch Haewel is the daughter of a female Cleric of Maethor Naneth and a jeweler.</p>\n<h1>Significant Characters</h1>\n<h2>Tanna, Leader of the Tau Circa</h2>\n<p>Tanna was born in the southern portion of Edhellond to two clerics of <span style=\"font-family:Signika, sans-serif\"><span style=\"color:rgb(25, 24, 19);font-family:Signika, sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-variant-ligatures:normal;font-variant-caps:normal;font-weight:400;letter-spacing:normal;orphans:2;text-align:start;text-indent:0px;text-transform:none;white-space:normal;widows:2;word-spacing:0px;-webkit-text-stroke-width:0px;text-decoration-thickness:initial;text-decoration-style:initial;text-decoration-color:initial;display:inline !important;float:none\">Maethor</span></span> @UUID[JournalEntry.dOJJ8mRNTPtoihmF.JournalEntryPage.oyFVdicDq8mbjOWw]{Naneth}. As she grew, she took to the teachings of her parents, but instead of simply worshipping Naneth, Tanna wanted to show others the glory of the Warrior Mother.</p>\n<p>To do this, she trained as hard as she could, pushing herself past limits she wasn’t aware she had, both physically and spiritually.</p>\n<p>When Tanna was at her physical peak, she became the apprentice to Eenthi, the (then) leader of the Tau Circa. He taught her to trust her mind as well as her heart, teaching her the dirty tricks that other races use and how to counter them. He tempered her spirit with reality. He formed her into the woman she is today; tough, no-nonsense, and practical, but still filled with the wonder of Naneth.</p>\n<p>She has an unwavering loyalty to Matriarch Birron, but places the safety of the Elven lands above even that of the Matriarch and will not hesitate to question decisions made at the throne.</p>\n<h2>Erilanwen, Advisor to the Matriarch</h2>\n<p>Erilanwen is the current advisor to Matriarch Birron and a Cleric of Maethor Naneth.</p>\n<p>Born in Tal, Erilanwen was orphaned at age twenty-five when his parents we killed during a wild bear attack. Before this happened, both of his parents taught him the ways of Asaya Naneth. After the attack, his attitude changed and he found himself gravitation toward Maethor Naneth.</p>\n<p>As he aged, he became a cleric of Maethor Naneth, but found that he retained some of his parents’ teachings regarding Asaya Naneth. While he does still feel anger for his parents being killed, he has tried to find a balance between the two aspects of Naneth within himself. Although he is prone to anger-filled outbursts, he is also capable of great caring and empathy. He tries to lend these qualities in his advisement of the Matriarch.</p>\n<h2>Arfindiel</h2>\n<p>Two things that Elves excel in are magic and art and foremost in Edhellond among goldsmiths is Arfindiel.</p>\n<p>Arfindiel learned goldsmithing from his parents who in turn, learned it from time spent with the @UUID[JournalEntry.QlctNkzE9injOde9.JournalEntryPage.t4LZuyNruvzneOHD]{Dwarf} before the Banishing and the closing of the Edhellian borders.</p>\n<p>Born with a minor talent for magic, Arfindiel surpassed his parents in his talent for manipulating precious metals.</p>\n<p>When he approached Haewel Birron, he brought to her what he considers his greatest work: a holy symbol of Naneth. The leaf is made of copper colored green, with the edges and veins of the leaf made of platinum. The arrow is made from pieces of one of Haewel’s own arrows, the arrowhead made from pure gold and fletching made of silver. She carries it to this day as her own holy symbol.</p>\n<p>Arfindiel stays out of the politics that his wife is engaged with. He prefers to stay out of the limelight and create new artistic pieces.</p>\n<h2>Tacaeon</h2>\n<p>Tacaeon is young, barely into adulthood. His age and enthusiasm belies his sorcerous abilities.</p>\n<p>His magic appeared to Tacaeon very early, as he was passing into his thirties. Instead of settling down with a tutor, of which there were many, Tacaeon’s parents encouraged him to practice his own. He took to magic as the proverbial duck to water.</p>\n<p>Tacaeon has a small workshop near Tal that he calls his “hutch.” Inside, he is almost constantly experimenting, a sign indicating such is hung on the door of the hutch.</p>\n<p>Haewel chose him as her advisor due to his age. As everyone around her has the experience of many years, most of them have lost Tacaeon’s fresh, unadulterated view of the world.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n</div>","markdown":""},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"sort":0,"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{"monks-enhanced-journal":{"appendix":false},"core":{"sheetClass":""}}}],"_stats":{"systemId":"dnd5e","systemVersion":"2.1.4","coreVersion":"10.291","createdTime":1663485627864,"modifiedTime":1675658459788,"lastModifiedBy":"EsIYTtNnjwxUbKOG"},"_id":"wVQiwLZtRuaqbpFA","ownership":{"default":0,"R5IsvMTH5P79pBoG":3},"folder":"j9cXBagzZ1ARsO2I","sort":1400000},{"name":"Timaeus","pages":[{"name":"Timaeus","type":"text","_id":"hnQDgK0SceEGQoUn","title":{"show":false,"level":1},"image":{},"text":{"format":1,"content":"<div class=\"aventyr\">\n<p class=\"s5\">Timaeus</p>\n<img style=\"display:block;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto\" src=\"modules/aaw-games-aventyr/Setting-images/TIMAEUS-750x539.webp\" width=\"489\" height=\"474\" />\n<p>To the outside world, Timaeus looks like an idealistic place. Every man, woman and child has magical talent, their military is a precision machine, and they are ruled over by the wisest and most powerful wizards in the known world—the Obelisk Order. However appearances aren’t everything, and like many perfect things, its interior tells another story entirely.</p>\n<p>Timaeus is mostly a peaceful place due to a perpetual military presence and because the citizenry lives under the constant fear of the living dead, as well as a government that keeps both the populace and their soldiers in check. Secrets are not to be spoken aloud, and any troublemakers or revolutionaries are quickly tracked down and executed.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<img style=\"float:left;margin:0px 10px 10px 0px;border:0px\" src=\"modules/aaw-games-aventyr/Setting-images/Final-Eventual-c-gary-dupois-timaen-mage-232x300.webp\" width=\"232\" height=\"300\" />\n<p>It is true that every natural-born citizen of Timaeus is taught magic as early as they can read, but this is done both out of desperation as it is out of inborn talent; any children who reach the age of eight without proof of magical ability are stolen from their homes, never to be seen again. Though no more than one in a dozen youths is taken this way, many mothers make deals with planar creatures and outsiders just to ensure their child has magical potential.</p>\n<p>Likewise, the military has proven itself to be exceptional—for nearly a thousand years it has been in a perpetual war against the undead surging from the deadlands and the army shows little sign of wearing thin. Yet despite this bravery, the country is fragmented into six orders, six armies struggling for control against both the undead and one another—instead of uniting as a unified force.</p>\n<p>Worst of all is the Obelisk Order themselves. When they stopped the shard of the sun they were unarguably the most powerful and wisest wizards in the world; but that was centuries ago and in that time they have calcified, becoming shells of their former selves who can do nothing but continue their eternal ritual. Without the clear guiding force of the Obelisk Order themselves, Timaeus borders on self-destruction. As the leaders of the six armies become increasingly obsessed with the minutiae of citizens everyday life for the slightest advantage over the others, they become ever blinder to the dangers massing both within and without the country’s borders.</p>\n<h1>History</h1>\n<p><strong>Year –813:</strong> The Timaeus Academy is founded by six explorer-wizards that feel the ley-lines at the site were extroardinary and would encourage magical growth amongst students of magic.</p>\n<p><strong>Year –784</strong>: The city of @UUID[.OYj59KJky98HgcM7#maeus]{Maeus} is settled around the Timaeus Academy.</p>\n<p><strong>Year –731:</strong> As settlers expand through the brushlands, more and more children are born with magical talents until eventually, nearly every citizen of the nation develops magical powers.</p>\n<img style=\"float:right;margin:0px 10px 10px 0px;border:0px\" src=\"modules/aaw-games-aventyr/Setting-images/Academic-Town-Color-F-245x300.webp\" width=\"245\" height=\"300\" />\n<p><strong>Year –598:</strong> Feuds between the masters of the Timaeus Academy lead to the devastating Campaign of Roses, killing thousands. The remaining masters build an obelisk in the courtyard of the academy as a memorial, naming themselves the Obelisk Order so they will never forget the dangers of untapped magic.</p>\n<p><strong>Year –219:</strong> The Black Halls appears from out of nowhere, within sight of Maeus.</p>\n<p><strong>Year –1:</strong> @UUID[.EVR6caNc4jmcLjmb]{Mek’Madius} is cast out of the Obelisk Order.</p>\n<p><strong>Year 0:</strong> The Obelisk Order send the Shard of Sun into orbit rather than allowing it to crash into and destroy Aventyr. The resulting ritual levels the original Timaeus Academy, killing dozens of promising wizards and destroying thousands of years of arcane knowledge. Energy released by the event alters the local geography, creating the Scorched Lands to the west and the @UUID[.OYj59KJky98HgcM7#the-deadlands]{deadlands} that will come to define the northern border of Timaeus.</p>\n<p><strong>Year 16:</strong> @UUID[.hnQDgK0SceEGQoUn#the-six-orders]{Six orders} are founded, one for each remaining member of the Obelisk Order. Their leaders look entirely to one member of the order for guidance however with each annual ritual that passes, they are more difficult to reach and their responses become shorter and more cryptic.</p>\n<p><strong>Year 108:</strong> The undead surge forth from the deadlands, razing cities and destroying the countryside as they go. @UUID[.uPbpU972uzF4TxuE#the-order-of-the-blade]{The Order of the Blade} mounts the first Warmblooded Campaign to drive the undead back into the deadlands, establishing four border fortresses in so doing.</p>\n<p><strong>Year 391:</strong> The undead again surge from the deadlands, showing amazing cognitive ability as they overtake each of the border fortresses one at a time, almost entirely eliminating the @UUID[.uPbpU972uzF4TxuE#the-order-of-the-blade]{Order of the Blade} in a defeat now known as the Red Plague.</p>\n<p><strong>Year 393:</strong> The Second Warmblooded Campaign begins the grueling task of driving the undead back north, into the deadlands. Martial Law is declared and the military @UUID[.uPbpU972uzF4TxuE#the-order-of-the-shield]{Order of the Shield} takes official control of the country.</p>\n<p><strong>Year 418:</strong> The Second Warmblooded Campaign succeeds in freeing most of northern Timaeus from the grasp of the undead. However, constant border skirmishes lead to perpetual casualties, forced enlistment, and the creation of the first reanimates.</p>\n<p><strong>Year 463:</strong> @UUID[.uPbpU972uzF4TxuE#the-order-of-the-shield]{The Order of the Shield }declares the country is safe only to have a surging of undead destroy yet another northern settlement. The shamed order is ousted by the newly rebuilt @UUID[.uPbpU972uzF4TxuE#the-order-of-the-blade]{Order of the Blade}, who take the offensive into the deadlands to put down the growing threat.</p>\n<p><strong>Year 497:</strong> @UUID[.uPbpU972uzF4TxuE#the-order-of-the-blade]{The Order of the Blade} proves that at least some of the undead raised within the deadlands cannot be permanently destroyed by any known means. In an effort to prevent another Red Plague they begin a practice that lasts to this day of daily raids into the deadlands to destroy any unliving blight they see.</p>\n<p><strong>Year 901:</strong> In an effort to raise dwindling morale and reduce growing bureaucracy, the Order of the Blade raises all @UUID[.uPbpU972uzF4TxuE]{six orders} back to equal status once more. Though their goals remain the same as they once did, each is now little more than a specialized military unit. Martial law and waves of forced enlistment remain an uncontested fact of everyday life for all but those with the longest memories.</p>\n<h1>Timean Naming</h1>\n<p>Though popular names vary widely from year to year, nearly all Timean given names are two distinct syllables. In the Common tongue, the short pause between characters is commonly represented by a hyphen, though individuals occasionally choose to spell their name without, such as the infamous @UUID[.EVR6caNc4jmcLjmb]{Mek’Madius}.</p>\n<p>Timean surnames are often only a single syllable and when formally written are placed before the given name, and separated by a hard pause (represented in the Common alphabet by an apostrophe).</p>\n<h2>Timean Male Names</h2>\n<p>Do-Ius, Mad-Kyun, Sun-Hyun, Syung-Won, Ja-Kyun</p>\n<h2>Timean Female Names</h2>\n<p>Amin-Jin, Min-Sao, Son-Yeo, Ji-Hei</p>\n<h2>Common Timean Surnames</h2>\n<p>Car, Kai, Ra, Mek, Nan</p>\n</div>","markdown":""},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"sort":900000,"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{"monks-enhanced-journal":{"appendix":false},"core":{"sheetClass":""}}},{"name":"The Six Orders","type":"text","_id":"uPbpU972uzF4TxuE","title":{"show":true,"level":1},"image":{},"text":{"format":1,"content":"<div class=\"aventyr\">\n<p class=\"s5\">The Six Orders</p>\n<p>The government of Timaeus is broken down into six orders; @UUID[.hnQDgK0SceEGQoUn#the-order-of-the-rose]{the Rose}, @UUID[.hnQDgK0SceEGQoUn#the-order-of-the-staff]{the Staff}, @UUID[.hnQDgK0SceEGQoUn#the-order-of-the-wand]{the Wand}, @UUID[.hnQDgK0SceEGQoUn#the-order-of-the-shield]{the Shield}, @UUID[.uPbpU972uzF4TxuE#the-order-of-the-blade]{the Blade}, and @UUID[.uPbpU972uzF4TxuE#the-order-of-the-cloak]{the Cloak}. Each represents one of the members of the Obelisk Order and is in theory run by them—though they haven’t been consulted in generations. In practice each order is run by its own @UUID[.uPbpU972uzF4TxuE#timaen-terminology]{jang} (pronounced “yang”) who vie for dominance over one another as often as they work together. They all promote from entirely within their own ranks, and each jang chooses their own successors personally—often establishing their replacements decades before they intend to need one in case of an untimely “accident”.</p>\n<p>Though the organizational structure of each order is different, they have all been known to hire mercenaries and assassins from outside the country both publicly and clandestinely (to accomplish deeds they do not want to be associated with doing themselves).</p>\n<h2>The Order of the Rose</h2>\n<p> </p>\n<img style=\"float:right;margin:0px 10px 10px 0px;border:0px\" src=\"modules/aaw-games-aventyr/Setting-images/order-of-the-rose-300x300.webp\" width=\"231\" height=\"231\" />\n<p>The most diverse of the orders, its leader @UUID[.UPVEdWjUv9JYfjX1#nanmin-jun]{Sojang Nan’Min-Jun} manages dozens of subordinates each of whom oversees magical distribution and use amongst one or more trades and professions across the country. He is a patient man but has a terrible temper when provoked, and he insists that all contracts be signed in blood, openly carrying a special bloodletting knife with him at all times to ensure such a rite is always carried out.</p>\n<p>Min-Jun also manages all imports and exports from the country—which is little. Timaeus primarily acquires few foreign goods (only a small amount of food) and publicly trades nothing though secretly, they do sell the occasional skyship or magical weapon to those wealthy enough to afford it. The Order of the Rose also serves as the country’s semi-underground information network. They encourage both loyalty and fear amongst the populace, requiring under fear of punishment that people report unusual amounts of magical usage from their friends and neighbors—or any other suspicious activity. Information about those who are potentially misusing their magic or otherwise might be troublemakers is typically passed to the Order of the Cloak, who then act on information that proves reliable.</p>\n<h2>The Order of the Staff</h2>\n<img style=\"float:right;margin:0px 10px 10px 0px;border:0px\" src=\"modules/aaw-games-aventyr/Setting-images/order-of-the-staff-67x300.webp\" width=\"67\" height=\"300\" />\n<p>The official mandate of the Order of the Staff is to oversee and improve the arcane schools across Timaeus, a duty which the order has performed with stellar efficiency for generations. However, the order’s control extends far beyond simple magical knowledge—they strive to control all information both within and without the country.</p>\n<p>Their leader, @UUID[.UPVEdWjUv9JYfjX1#longkai-kyun]{Hanjang Long’Kai-kyun}, manages this task first by throttling information that the citizens of Timaeus receive. Educational programs available to the common citizen stress loyalty to the six orders, the flawlessness of their leaders, and the chaos and evil of the world outside Timean borders. Though Kai-Kyun is undoubtedly a genius when it comes to information, he is absolutely useless when it comes to dealing with people. He squirrels himself away in a library nearly all of every day, emerging only to review the decisions made by his six trusted sangjwa’s (pronounced “sane-wah”) who head the six major academies, one of which is Timaeus Academy itself.</p>\n<p>To keep out false knowledge the order maintains a fierce presence in every port town and landing, upholding a strict policy on border crossings—namely that as little of it happens as possible. Total isolation is beyond their reach, however, so instead they sell trade and travel permits to foreigners (so long as they don’t appear to be spreading false messages of the government or the outside world) and hire them as mercenaries for the Order of the Blade.</p>\n<p>Despite the overall quality of the schools run by the Order of the Staff, few outside those who join the order are ever allowed access to them. Those not born within Timaeus must pay a small fortune each year to be allowed to study within any of their hallowed halls, and those who are must pledge their life in the order’s service.</p>\n<h2>The Order of the Wand</h2>\n<img style=\"float:right;margin:0px 10px 10px 0px;border:0px\" src=\"modules/aaw-games-aventyr/Setting-images/order-of-the-wand-300x300.webp\" width=\"219\" height=\"219\" />\n<p>As long as there have been opinions, there have been those who force them upon others. Nowhere is this less true than the Order of the Wand, who constantly monitor the population for any sign of general distress before working to quiet it—by any means necessary. What this usually means, however, is that they spread propaganda, stage fake uprisings elsewhere, or otherwise seed the population with the false idea that nothing is wrong, or that acting on anything they feel is wrong will not end well.</p>\n<p>Any major operation is led directly by @UUID[.UPVEdWjUv9JYfjX1#mikmin-hei]{Sojang Mik’Min-Hei} herself; she has always been a master of making people see things her way, though on the exterior she rarely gives off even a sliver of emotion herself.</p>\n<p>When dealing with smaller-scale operations that focus only the removal of one or two targets they typically defer to the @UUID[.uPbpU972uzF4TxuE#the-order-of-the-cloak]{Order of the Cloak}, and they encourage citizens to speak to the @UUID[.hnQDgK0SceEGQoUn#the-order-of-the-rose]{Order of the Rose} instead of themselves. Though it is a rarity to see their agents in action, the Order of the Wand does employ a number of specialized evokers and enchanters to perform operations themselves when no other alternative is available.</p>\n<h2>The Order of the Shield</h2>\n<img style=\"float:right;margin:0px 10px 10px 0px;border:0px\" src=\"modules/aaw-games-aventyr/Setting-images/Drekons-Kite-Shield1-copy-162x300.webp\" width=\"162\" height=\"300\" />\n<p>The longest-standing military order in Timaeus, they control the majority of the country’s navy as well as a small fleet of skyships (alongside other mobile units) capable of crossing the ocean or the deadlands at any time in defense of the country. Officially, the Order of the Shield is also a religious order who worship a variety of deities, notably amongst them @UUID[Compendium.Aventyr-Campaign-Setting.aventyr-campaign.dOJJ8mRNTPtoihmF.JournalEntryPage.zNH5DtHDKD52Ufaf]{Onael}, @UUID[Compendium.Aventyr-Campaign-Setting.aventyr-campaign.dOJJ8mRNTPtoihmF.JournalEntryPage.QiPqpoNg3jLKKBlu]{Hado} and Xio—gods of law and of war. The order’s daejang takes this devotion to the pantheons of combat extremely seriously, and Il’Mad-Kyun is considered a zealot by most and a bully by all.</p>\n<p>Mad-Kyun has done an effective job at keeping external threats at bay with his posturing and regular threats against any nation near enough to listen; he’s been known to threaten to adjust the Obelisk Order’s ritual just enough to shift the location of the Scorched Lands so that it destroys anyone who might oppose him or Timaeus. None are sure if he actually has this power, but it is certain that if he were to do such a thing, much of the world would unite against Timaeus to prevent Aventyr’s destruction at the hands of a madman. Despite Mad-Kyun’s bizarre fanaticism, he also cares deeply for his pets and those under his command he is directly responsible for. He has half-dozen servants each for his horse, his battle-turtle, and his wolf-hound, all of whom must be ready for battle at a moment’s notice.</p>\n<h2>The Order of the Blade</h2>\n<img style=\"float:right;margin:0px 10px 10px 0px;border:0px\" src=\"modules/aaw-games-aventyr/Setting-images/sword-rick-h3-128x300.png\" width=\"128\" height=\"300\" />\n<p>The country’s second standing army, the Order of the Blade, exists solely to handle internal threats. Primarily they fight the undead from the @UUID[.OYj59KJky98HgcM7#the-deadlands]{deadlands} but they are also responsible for managing banditry and natural beasts of all kinds. They are led by @UUID[.UPVEdWjUv9JYfjX1#haikal-sean]{Daejang Hai’Kal-Sean}, a bastion of honesty and loyalty within a government known to be self-serving. He fights to protect the people the best he can and is seemingly tireless in his efforts. He sees law and goodness as inseparable, and any who seek to undermine the law are perceived as evil no matter the reason.</p>\n<p>Though the order is led by battle wizards and other combat focused mages, the Order of the Blade is the most diverse of the six orders. They have units of wizards, entire companies of immigrant mercenaries, and most interestingly, companies who must fight without the aid of any magic at all, accompanied by battle-tortoises equipped with 10 ft. tall crystals that radiate antimagic. These antimagical units are officially intended to fight rogue spellcasters and army deserters, yet whispers abound that these are the kidnapped children that lack any magical talent of their own.</p>\n<h2>The Order of the Cloak</h2>\n<img style=\"float:right;margin:0px 10px 10px 0px;border:0px\" src=\"modules/aaw-games-aventyr/Setting-images/cloak-rich-h1-144x300.png\" width=\"144\" height=\"300\" />\n<p>The most secretive of the cabals that rule the country, the Order of the Cloak doesn’t have a visible presence in Timaeus and instead works through spies, assassins, and covert agents within the other orders. Despite this, their actions are easily recognized and whenever a person is found mysteriously dead or missing, none doubt who is responsible. To outside inquirers they are led by @UUID[.UPVEdWjUv9JYfjX1#koamin-jin]{Bimiljang Ko’Amin-Jin}, a patient and arguably evil woman who wears a mask and black cloak when out in public. Yet it is rumored that Amin-Jin, and thus the entire order, takes her orders from some other entirely secret, true jang not known outside the upper echelon of the order—perhaps one as alien as the black halls where Amin-Jin is frequently seen.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<h1>Timaen Terminology</h1>\n<p>While the Timean military is structured similarly to militaries elsewhere in the world, they use uncommon naming conventions.</p>\n<h4><strong>Jang (“yang”)</strong> The general and leader of an order.

Some of these include The Festival of Darkness—celebrated on the day the Shard of the Sun is furthest from Aventyr, 140 days after The Shedding—and the Rain of Petals, which celebrates the greatness of the six jangs.</p>\n<h1>The Shedding</h1>\n<p>Once each Shard Year the Obelisk Order perform a ritual to channel energy from five huge crystals surrounding @UUID[.n71mdJTU3DzXqram#the-pentagram]{The Pentagram}, sending a visible pillar of light up into the sky to strike the Shard of the Sun in an explosive event known as The Shedding. During the Shedding even the safest areas within the deadlands become utterly uninhabitable as raw energy rains from the sky. This energy (known as sun magic) is later collected and used to charge the crystal pillars once again—and much more besides.</p>\n<p>Despite the devastation (which is very localized, mostly to the Scorched Lands), this event is celebrated akin to the new year with all fervor and excess usually associated with annual holidays of renewal—one of the few days of the year that such excitement is encouraged by the six orders. Huge feasts are conjured and made freely available to anyone within any of Timaeus’ major cities, foreigners and citizens are allowed to mingle (though not entirely freely), and merchants and craftsmen of all sorts migrate into the cities (which are normally followed by a week of major mercantile activity across the country).</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>Sun Magic</h2>\n<img style=\"float:left;margin:0px 10px 10px 0px;border:0px\" src=\"modules/aaw-games-aventyr/Setting-images/Sun-stock-art-modified-224x300.png\" width=\"201\" height=\"269\" />\n<p>Sun magic is a remnant of @UUID[.n71mdJTU3DzXqram#the-shedding]{The Shedding}, energy so dense that it takes physical form as a glowing orange liquid hot enough to burn unprotected skin.

Though it can be found in the Scorched Lands where the magic of the obelisk ritual connects with the Shard, the rain of magic continues across the ocean into the deadlands and across northern Timaeus (and even further east into the ocean).</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>The Tortoise Migration</h2>\n<p>The day after @UUID[.n71mdJTU3DzXqram#the-shedding]{The Shedding}, the massive crystals are taken from the perimeter of the @UUID[.n71mdJTU3DzXqram#the-pentagram]{Pentagram} and loaded onto trains of tortoises to begin their journey across the countryside to collect the fallen sun magic. The beginning of this migration is seen with much fanfare, as it is never known exactly how long the tortoises will be away from the city for (though it is rarely less than half a year). In addition to the five heavily guarded crystal tortoises, dozens if not hundreds of more mundane merchants and travelers begin their own, lesser migrations across the countryside. Many of them ride tortoises of their own that are similar to the crystal tortoises, complete with large crystals destined to be charged with @UUID[.n71mdJTU3DzXqram#sun-magic]{sun magic} and then reforged into magical items and weapons.</p>\n<h2>Giant Tortoises</h2>\n<p>Huge tortoises have been native to Timaeus since the original wizards settled here. Over the generations, they have been largely domesticated—though it still takes great effort to raise and train one to properly take a rider. They are commonplace amongst the orders but demand exorbitant prices elsewhere, easily thousands of gold pieces at bare minimum; this price is only logical, however, as it takes nearly five years for a hatched tortoise to reach the physical and mental maturity required to carry a rider, and the beasts can live for hundreds of years. The oldest known tortoise is over 400 years old and lives in a comfortable pen in one of the magical academies in Maeus.</p>\n<h2>The Pentagram</h2>\n<p> </p>\n<img style=\"float:right;margin:0px 10px 10px 0px;border:0px\" src=\"modules/aaw-games-aventyr/Setting-images/p04-pentagram-sade-300x290.webp\" width=\"226\" height=\"218\" />\n<p>All that remains of the original Timaeus Academy, this massive pentagram is effectively frozen in time, protected by powerful magic. Without extensive protection, one cannot even approach the Pentagram itself, where the Obelisk Order continues their perpetual ritual to keep the Shard of the Sun’s orbit stable. Nearly a hundred feet outside the Pentagram are five large pits home to huge, charged crystals that multiply in number as the time for @UUID[.n71mdJTU3DzXqram#the-shedding]{the Shedding} draws near, marking the border of where it is safe to approach without magical defenses.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<h1>Timean Religion</h1>\n<p>Unlike so much else in Timaeus, citizens are allowed to freely worship any god they choose so long as they do not disrupt the flow of society around them. Despite this freedom, much of the country praises gods of magic and warfare—the aspects that touch their everyday lives. The most commonly worshipped deity is @UUID[JournalEntry.dOJJ8mRNTPtoihmF.JournalEntryPage.o7Bl7XnxenERvjAq]{Xio}, the Eternal Combatant. The people pray to him daily to keep the war at the fringes, so that their warriors may someday go to join the battle, rather than the battle come to them.</p>\n</div>","markdown":""},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"sort":1100000,"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}},{"name":"Timean Technology","type":"text","_id":"W0FN1UQoEGs8vYzZ","title":{"show":false,"level":1},"image":{},"text":{"format":1,"content":"<div class=\"aventyr\"><p class=\"s5\">Timean Technology</p><img style=\"float:right;margin:0px 10px 10px 0px;border:0px\" src=\"modules/Aventyr-Campaign-Setting/Setting-images/Image_Portfolio_107_Fantasy-Jason-Walton-67-126x300.jpg\" width=\"126\" height=\"300\" /><p>Populated by wizards and literally overflowing with magic, Timaeus boasts many incredible and unusual advances in both science and magic, their discoveries far advancing many others elsewhere in Aventyr. Some of these inventions have become commonplace throughout the world (such as the interposing hand series of spells) whereas others are merely commonly known (like the skyships), while some are far-flung rumors far beyond where they are invented (unique constructs are a common example but there are numerous others). While most of these creations are magical in nature, some are entirely technological—for instance, firearms, while still rare, are an accepted part of life within Timaeus.</p><p>@UUID[.uPbpU972uzF4TxuE]{The six orders}, especially the @UUID[.uPbpU972uzF4TxuE#the-order-of-the-staff]{Order of the Staff}, keep a close eye on civilians developing new technologies and have been known to regularly confiscate or destroy anything that might be too dangerous (a questionable practice that has been the source of no small bit of derision from the more liberal-minded mages). Despite the routine destruction of small villages or devastation wrought by experimentations gone awry, the people accept the practice without much complaint; those that do not quickly find themselves in the sights of the orders.</p><h2>Skyships</h2><p>Known as airships, skyshells, and by countless of other monickers, skyships are found almost exclusively within the Timean capital of Maeus where the power to keep them airborne is most readily available. Typically crafted from the shells of gigantic tortoises reinforced by magic, common skyships are 60 ft. long and hold a crew of four comfortably. Far larger ones do exist, of course, that can hold hundreds of soldiers at once—though all such vessels are currently based within the @UUID[.uPbpU972uzF4TxuE#the-order-of-the-shield]{Order of the Shield’s} imposing armory. Most skyships are able to travel about three times as fast as a man can run (180 ft. speed), though as larger airships exist so do faster ones. The fastest one known to exist was known as The Tera-Bolt, which could travel faster than the eye could see; however, it disappeared over twenty years ago and hasn’t been seen since.</p><table style=\"width:100%;height:730.953px\" border=\"1\"><tbody><tr style=\"height:28.2188px\"><td style=\"background-color:rgb(0, 0, 0);width:99.8714%;height:28.2188px\" colspan=\"6\">&lt;<span style=\"color:rgb(255, 255, 255)\"><span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">Statistics for Dungeons &amp; Dragons 5th Edition</span></span></td></tr><tr style=\"height:666.297px\"><td style=\"background-color:rgb(247, 141, 167);width:99.8714%;height:666.297px\" colspan=\"6\"><h3>Black Arrow</h3><p>Long, narrow, and entirely black, a Black Arrow is an exceptionally uncommon ship in the Timean air force.

Lower-quality crystals are also often used as a material to make weapons, as even flawed crystal is often as hard as steel (note that mechanically these weapons are identical to common metal weapons.)</p><p> </p><h2>Mutants</h2><p>Though the best-known side effects of the Shard of the Sun are the Scorched Lands and the @UUID[.OYj59KJky98HgcM7#the-deadlands]{Deadlands}, the overabundance of magic it has brought about an entire spectrum of new creatures (created both deliberately and accidentally). These creations span every facet of existence from humans with extra limbs, to chimerical connections of a dozen different creatures, or oozes that can shift in and out of the Material Plane. Collectively, they are known as mutants. Elsewhere in Aventyr, this term is reserved for creatures transformed by @UUID[.n71mdJTU3DzXqram#the-shedding]{The Shedding} or through @UUID[.n71mdJTU3DzXqram#sun-magic]{Sun Magic}, but in Timaeus it covers a much wider variety of creatures—everything from sun-magic mutants to distasteful constructs or even aberrations. Very rarely are any mutants even similar, but some few experiments have yielded reproducible results (though even in such cases it is uncommon to see more than a handful of similarly altered creatures together).</p><p> </p></div>","markdown":""},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"sort":1200000,"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{"monks-enhanced-journal":{"appendix":false},"core":{"sheetClass":""}}},{"sort":1300000,"name":"Geography","type":"text","_id":"OYj59KJky98HgcM7","title":{"show":false,"level":1},"image":{},"text":{"format":1,"content":"<div class=\"aventyr\">\n<p class=\"s5\">Geography</p>\n<h2>The Deadlands</h2>\n<p>Though the Shard of the Sun orbits the planet and comes closest over the Scorched Lands, its orbit brings it across the northern border of Timaeus. While the land isn’t quite as blasted and desolate as it is to the west, the deadlands remain a dry and dangerous place—particularly where the @UUID[JournalEntry.wVQiwLZtRuaqbpFA]{Silent Forest} to the north suddenly ends in a line of dry scrub and withered trees, all of which are thick with undead that appear utterly indestructible.</p>\n<img style=\"margin:0px 10px 10px 0px;border:0px;float:right\" src=\"modules/aaw-games-aventyr/Setting-images/goblin_dog_bg__matt_bulahao-deadlands-timaeus-300x225.webp\" width=\"259\" height=\"194\" />\n<p>The deadlands define Timaeus’ northern and only, land-based border, and they find little objection from the elves that they claim the land as theirs—the lithe folk are happy enough to grant the country of mages their isolation without complaint. Though the blasted sands technically border the Silent Forest to their north, the undead within seem to have a particular hatred of Timaeus and surge south in unending waves, forcing large armies to field just keep the hordes at bay. These armies are primarily stationed around four border fortresses: two of which have been recovered and remade from the first Warmblooded Campaign, and two of which have been rebuilt larger and stronger after their respective destructions. Despite the danger of such an endeavor, some few trading routes through the region persist, heavily patrolled by members of the @UUID[.uPbpU972uzF4TxuE#the-order-of-the-blade]{The Order of the Blade} and @UUID[.uPbpU972uzF4TxuE#the-order-of-the-rose]{The Order of the Rose}</p>\n<h3>Kuchang</h3>\n<p>Visible for miles around because of the titanic obsidian slab that shadows the town, this settlement is the only well known, living collection of humanoids within the deadlands. Kuchang serves as a trading post for what little commerce exists between Timaeus and the @UUID[JournalEntry.wVQiwLZtRuaqbpFA]{Silent Forest}—mostly importing food in exchange for charged sun crystals. Save for a few days of the year around @UUID[.n71mdJTU3DzXqram#the-shedding]{The Shedding}, the town is sheltered from the worst of the Sun Shard’s magic by the thick slab of stone looming overhead, and protected from the undead by swarms of tiny golems. For the week on either side of the Shedding, the settlement is populated only by reanimates and constructs—beings safe from the fatal energy that rains from the sky.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Nyamo\">Nyamo</span></h2>\n<p>A port town founded long before Timaeus’ self-imposed isolation, this city sees a great deal of travel by those passing around Cape Fin. Nyamo is defined by the titanic wall down its center, separating the city into two parts—one for the Timean citizens, and the other where travelers and merchants may land and trade. Passage through the singular, huge gate is strictly regulated by the @UUID[.uPbpU972uzF4TxuE#the-order-of-the-staff]{The Order of the Staff}, but rumors persist of catacombs beneath the city used by smugglers of both goods (and more dangerously, ideas). For more detail see @UUID[.iUOrRhLyDdg71ghA]{Nyamo}</p>\n<h2>Maeus</h2>\n<p>The capital of Timaeus is constructed unlike nearly any other city on Aventyr, with the most developed areas around the border of the city, and the least desirable and dilapidated areas towards to the center with each tier of buildings approaching @UUID[.n71mdJTU3DzXqram#the-pentagram]{the Pentagram} seeing more and more wear.</p>\n<h2>Wyosani</h2>\n<p>What was formerly a salt mine has exploded into a prosperous mining city when 40 years ago they broke into an undiscovered series of caverns beneath their existing mines, containing titanic crystals of the sort used across the nation for crystalline items. The depths of these new caverns have yet to be fully explored or plumbed, but they have been searched for decades now seemingly without end (though rumblings can often be felt deeper below, prompting fears of a response from the Underworld).</p>\n<h2>Opongi Range</h2>\n<p>These large, white, almost cubic mountains have dominated western Timaeus for longer than the lands have been settled. Some believe they are the bones of a god or other ancient and titanic creature—others say they are abandoned alien structures riddled with never-used chambers to scale with the mountains themselves—but explorers that trek there rarely return to confirm any of these rumors.</p>\n<h2>Mek’Madius’ Plateau</h2>\n<p>Though few know the actual location of his lair, the locals rightly believe this steppe is the home of the seventh (exiled) member of the Obelisk Order—the lich @UUID[.EVR6caNc4jmcLjmb]{Mek’Madius}. The Timean government give the mountain a wide berth, though adventurers and treasure-hunters do occasionally strike out towards the plateau, and some have later returned to bring torment to the towns they had visited preparing for their journey.</p>\n<h2>Thick Isles</h2>\n<p>Not officially settled by Timaeus, these islands are each dominated by a volcanic mountain surrounded by thick and supposedly untamable jungle, much of which is inhabited with dangerous and strange creatures. Despite these obvious challenges, the islands are a regular harbor for fugitives and rebels fighting against the Timean government and each holds a handful of heavily armed camps along its shores. Some even claim to have made alliances with the insectoid natives (creatures that call themselves dromites and have strange powers over the mind).</p>\n<h2>Cape Fin</h2>\n<p> </p>\n<img style=\"margin:0px 10px 10px 0px;border:0px;float:left\" src=\"modules/aaw-games-aventyr/Setting-images/animated_object__eric_quigley-300x220.webp\" width=\"300\" height=\"220\" />\n<p>The peninsula jutting south off Timaeus towards Picollo is home to many harbors; with the exception of @UUID[.OYj59KJky98HgcM7#nyamo]{Nyamo} they are barred and magically protected from all foreign traffic.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h2><span id=\"The_Hanne\">The Hanne</span></h2>\n<p>Nearly separating the country in two, the Hanne River flows southwest and northeast before turning south again into the ocean. It is nearly a mile across at its widest point, but rarely more than 50 ft. deep, and fed by several other waterways nearly as large. Of note among the tributaries are the Imihanne in the north and the Namihanne in the south.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"The_Scorching_Sea\">The Scorching Sea</span></h2>\n<p>Named for the way the sea boils each day as the Shard of the Sun passes overhead, the sea to the west of the country is known to be home to thousands of undead sea creatures and more bizarre monsters besides. Strangely these creatures are never seen south of the tip of @UUID[.OYj59KJky98HgcM7#cape-fin]{Cape Fin}, though none have identified a clear reason for why the monsters contain themselves to their established territories.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Maeus-2\">Maeus</span></h2>\n<p> </p>\n<img style=\"margin:0px 10px 10px 0px;border:0px;float:right\" src=\"modules/aaw-games-aventyr/Setting-images/Image_Portfolio_107_Fantasy-Jason-Walton-61-126x300.jpg\" width=\"126\" height=\"300\" />\n<p>Despite the near destruction of the city during the cataclysm that was the first Shedding, Maeus has been rebuilt and has risen from a center of learning to a metropolis of wonders. Commonly considered the most magical city in the world, it boasts its wealth and prosperity with magical displays on every street corner accompanied by impossible buildings in nearly every block.</p>\n<h3><span id=\"The_Black_Halls\">The Black Halls</span></h3>\n<p>After appearing mysteriously just outside of @UUID[.OYj59KJky98HgcM7#maeus$1]{Maeus} 1,500 years ago, this structure has been thoroughly searched and found to be an utterly empty complex save for a number of lethal traps. Most people today give the enigmatic building a wide berth but the @UUID[.uPbpU972uzF4TxuE#the-order-of-the-shield]{The Order of the Shield} (and some say the@UUID[.uPbpU972uzF4TxuE#the-order-of-the-cloak]{The Order of the Cloak}) use it as a prison for particularly dangerous convicts, having long discovered the magical incantations to seal or unseal nearly any door and window in the building.</p>\n<h3><span id=\"Everyday_Wonders\">Everyday Wonders</span></h3>\n<p>Even the poorest citizen of Timaeus has the advantage of Timaeus’ excess of magic. Eternally flaming crystals stand on tall posts every 50 ft. along each major road, as well as at intersections of smaller roads. Wells that produce their own water (known as everwells) can be found interspersed around the city, some able to produce hot or cold water on demand.</p>\n<h3><span id=\"Traveling_Houses\">Traveling Houses</span></h3>\n<p>Typically small, these buildings are in high demand where they exist. They maintain permanent magic portals to all other traveling houses throughout @UUID[.OYj59KJky98HgcM7#maeus$1]{Maeus} and specialize in teleportation to related guilds and structures across the country of Timaeus.</p>\n<h3><span id=\"New_Timaeus_Academy\">New Timaeus Academy</span></h3>\n<p>A sprawling affair that dominates an entire spoke of the city stretching from the @UUID[.OYj59KJky98HgcM7#old-timeaus-academy]{Old Timeaus Academy} all the way to the edge of the city, this institution is constantly bustling with activity. It serves not only as an academy and place of learning, but as a center for experimentation and innovation. This is also the primary birthplace of reanimates and the regional headquarters of the @UUID[.uPbpU972uzF4TxuE#the-order-of-the-staff]{The Order of the Staff}. Regardless of the vastness of the academy, enrollment is low, likely due to the restriction that only those who are approved by the Order of the Staff may attend.</p>\n<h3><span id=\"Old_Timeaus_Academy\">Old Timeaus Academy</span></h3>\n<p>Once a huge building sprawling over several acres of land, this ruin has been left untouched since the Campaign of Roses, save for the five-story tall obelisk standing in what was once the main courtyard, engraved with the names of all those lost. Aside from the general danger of being so near to @UUID[.OYj59KJky98HgcM7#the-pentagram]{The Pentagram} itself, ancient magical experiments left abandoned have a tendency to occasionally malfunction, releasing monsters into the streets or into the so-called Archive. The sprawling series of tunnels that once served as a vault and library for the academy now houses monsters, lost treasures, and more; many say the complex expands with each passing year, along with all the glory, riches, and power it offers..</p>\n<h3><span id=\"Cathedral_of_Shadow\">Cathedral of Shadow</span></h3>\n<img style=\"margin:0px 10px 10px 0px;border:0px;float:right\" src=\"modules/aaw-games-aventyr/Setting-images/Image_Portfolio_107_Fantasy-Jason-Walton-77-300x190.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"190\" />\n<p>Large, square, and utterly dark, no public entry is allowed into this imposing structure through the single door that faces out to the street. The sight of black-robed figures entering or leaving only give credence to the rumor that the building is one of, if not the main, headquarters for the @UUID[.uPbpU972uzF4TxuE#the-order-of-the-cloak]{The Order of the Cloak}. Locals know that questioning the figures ends in bloodshed and not answers, and thus give them a wide berth.</p>\n<h3><span id=\"The_Pentagram-2\">The Pentagram</span></h3>\n<p>Several hundred feet across, the Pentagram is where the Obelisk Order continue their eternal ritual to keep the Shard of the Sun in orbit. The structure radiates heat and energy comparable to the sun itself, and standing too close leaves one’s skin dry and sore. The corners of the Pentagram are comprised of five huge pits, each of which normally holds numerous clear crystals charged with sun magic the ancient mages will use at the next Shedding.</p>\n<p> </p>\n</div>","markdown":""},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{"core":{"sheetClass":"core.JournalTextTinyMCESheet"}}},{"sort":1400000,"name":"Nyamo","type":"text","_id":"iUOrRhLyDdg71ghA","title":{"show":false,"level":1},"image":{},"text":{"format":1,"content":"<div class=\"aventyr\">\n<p class=\"s5\">Nyamo</p>\n<p>Nyamo is a walled city; aggressive outside threats necessitated the construction of a sturdy barrier hundreds of years ago. Originally designed to repel intruders, it now serves a slightly different purpose—as the settlement became a center of commerce, traders from all over the world arrived in Nyamo to sell their wares and exchange ideas. While the goods and money were welcome, the ideas were not.</p>\n<img style=\"float:left;margin:0px 10px 10px 0px;border:0px\" src=\"modules/aaw-games-aventyr/Setting-images/Image_Portfolio_107_Fantasy-Jason-Walton-74-300x190.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"190\" />\n<p>The visiting merchants and migrants were mostly housed in the migrant district, which was composed of the majority of the northern half of the city. Construction began on a new section of the Nyamo Wall that effectively split the city in half, running down the middle and connecting each end to the original outer wall. Taller and thicker than the original wall, the huge gatehouse built into its center gave each side of the barrier its own portcullis.</p>\n<p>Traffic between the sections of the Nyamo Wall is strictly regulated—in order to pass, one must provide an acceptable reason, a gate tax must be paid, and a stamp issued. Those wishing to stay overnight must obtain permission and purchase a special permit to do so. Guards from the @UUID[.uPbpU972uzF4TxuE#the-order-of-the-staff]{The Order of the Staff} search each and every person that passes through the gate, ensuring that no contraband makes its way into Nyamo (normal magic items are not illegal, but may not pass through the gate; these must be surrendered or passage is also prohibited.) Usually travelers are given the option of simply turning around and not passing through the Nyamo Wall if they do not wish to surrender their items—in this city of Timaeus, this is just the cost of doing business. Those that pass through the gate are often followed by a member of the Order of the Staff, who make careful notes on interactions they make and often follow up questioning where searches occur (often using Nyamo scribe orbs).</p>\n<p>Those that wish to enter the city from outside must go to the Migrants’ Gate on the outer wall (unless they are a Timean citizen) where they are still subject to search and seizure, declaring all of their enchanted items; undeclared magic items are subject to confiscation. Those that wish to stay more than 24 hours must apply at the gate or at a Timean embassy for a permit, and anyone found entering the city under false pretenses are subject to expulsion or arrest. Only Timean citizens are allowed entry through the Timerian Gate. They must present the proper papers and declare any magic or valuable items obtained outside of Timaeus. Generally speaking, most citizens comply and seizures at this gate are rare.</p>\n<p>When the Nyamo Wall was constructed, the sewers under the city were modified, blocking passages with bars and grates, and in some cases blocking tunnels altogether. Over the years enterprising smugglers and other criminal elements have reopened some of these sealed passages to facilitate the burgeoning black market in Nyamo. While some goods are sold, it is most often news of the outside world that is traded, as well as books and other forms of publication. Several competing guilds operate underneath the Nyamo Wall, including those that support revolution; simple thievery and smuggling are often overlooked, with the occasional blatant offender caught and made an example of. However, the revolutionaries that deal in information and subterfuge are almost always put to death when caught.</p>\n<p>Entry into the tunnels that connect the two sides of the cities is a closely guarded secret. A select few safe houses on each side contain concealed entrances to the underground labyrinth—these are moved on a regular basis, the old entrances sealed up. Few people know of the existence of more than one way into the network under the Nyamo Wall, and even some of the guild masters do not know every entrance under their control.</p>\n<img style=\"display:block;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto\" src=\"modules/aaw-games-aventyr/Setting-images/warehouse-district-of-Nyamo.webp\" width=\"468\" height=\"737\" />\n<p> </p>\n</div>","markdown":""},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{"core":{"sheetClass":""}}},{"sort":1500000,"name":"Significant Characters","type":"text","_id":"UPVEdWjUv9JYfjX1","title":{"show":false,"level":1},"image":{},"text":{"format":1,"content":"<div class=\"aventyr\">\n<p class=\"s5\">Significant Characters</p>\n<h2>Nan’Min-Jun</h2>\n<p><strong>Nan’Min-Jun, Jang of the @UUID[.uPbpU972uzF4TxuE#the-order-of-the-rose]{Order of the Rose}</strong> (LE Male human aristocrat 8/wizard 8) Min-Jun makes himself to be an expert in everything, and very rarely is he proven wrong; he is excellent at foreseeing tiny details required to keep large plans on track.

In preparation for the arrival of the Shard of the Sun, he preached its benefits—the obtainment of unlimited energy, the power which would assist the high mages and all of Timaeus in dominating any foes that would dare to stand against them. The Obelisk Order vehemently opposed Mek’Madius’ stance and voted unanimously to revoke his place on the council; he was thrown out onto the street with the commoners, where he began to plot his revenge.</p>\n<p>As the Shard of the Sun grew closer to impacting the planet and Aventyr’s annihilation seemed imminent, the Obelisk Order marched north in a final attempt to intercept and destroy the incredibly powerful relic. Keeping to the shadows and using a potent artifact to remain undetected, Mek’Madius followed behind with nine of his former and most trusted apprentices, scheming to gain as much power as he could from the Shard of the Sun while stopping the Obelisk Order’s plans. The exiled mage was aware that his power alone would be insufficient to enact his revenge, but a mass sacrifice using souls to fuel his magic would give him a definite advantage over his former comrades.</p>\n<img style=\"float:left;margin:0px 10px 10px 0px;border:0px\" src=\"modules/aaw-games-aventyr/Setting-images/MekMadius-Hideout.webp\" width=\"342\" height=\"443\" />\n<p>The Obelisk Order arrived at the projected impact location of the Shard of the Sun, solemnly faced one another, and began the most powerful spell ever cast by mortals. Just as the rogue relic appeared overhead, Mek’Madius sacrificed his nine apprentices and began a powerful spell of his own. Utterly focused on their ritualistic arcane protections and the Shard of the Sun, the mages were unable to stop the exiled wizard as he channeled the soul energy into a powerful absorption spell, attempting to siphon off a portion of the magical and radiant energy from the Shard. But Mek’Madius’ evil and selfish acts came with a price—as a fragment of the powerful relic broke off and tumbled toward the earth, Mek’Madius’ very soul was drawn into the fragment. His selfishness and reckless abuse of power had transformed him into an undead creature, permanently bound to the fragment and destined to experience his unintended mortality in utter isolation.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>Fragment of the Sun Phylactery</h2>\n<p>Mek’Madius’ phylactery is not one he made by choice—his reckless use of souls to power the absorption spell failed to siphon all the power from the workings of the Obelisk Order, instead, channeling only some of the energy back through his own soul. At the same time as he completed his energy absorption, the mages repelled the Sun Shard from impacting the planet, causing fragments to break off.</p>\n<p>One of the largest fragments reflected the energy absorption back into Mek’Madius, pulling his soul out of his body and into the sky before slamming his essence into the sundered piece of the Shard of the Sun as it plummeted toward Aventyr. He had been transformed into a Lich, and the fragment of the Shard of the Sun his phylactery.

For most of its past the region was home to no more than tribes of boggards and barbarians; their primitive lives changed some 900 years ago when Tranak Blackscale made the swamp his domain. A @UUID[.IdjkM3iKo5NPY1zu#black-dragons]{black dragon} with a passion for cruelty for its malicious sake, he enslaved creatures from the swamp to fulfill his wicked needs and amassed a veritable army of thralls. Over the centuries Tranak sired several children with different mates, all of whom met a grisly end when he decided they had outlived their usefulness (and more importantly, his interest). Eventually, the brood grew too large and Tranak’s children settled across the swamp in their own domains, quickly coming to blows with each other in skirmishes kept to a minimum by the overwhelming presence of their draconic father.</p>\n<p>So it was until the year 497 when Tranak’s slaves rebelled against his tyrannical rule, forming a loose rebellion of swamp creatures under the @UUID[.IdjkM3iKo5NPY1zu#bog-trolls]{bog troll} Theeble Dead-eye. The dragon and his children fought together in what they perceived as an easy battle, but when Tranak and his two eldest were brought low by what the legends describe as a powerful secret weapon wielded by an unknown barbarian chieftain from an unnamed tribe, the six remaining children took flight and hid deep in the swamplands. Soon the alliance crumbled and boggards, trolls, and humans took up the roles they had before the arrival of Blackscale, fighting over small stretches of dry land in the otherwise inhospitable swamp.</p>\n<p>101 years after his death Tranak’s children revealed their presence to the tribes of the swamp—all six dragons swept through it sowing death and destruction everywhere they went. In the following years, the dragons started to fight amongst themselves over territory and slaves, their conflicts occasionally shaking the swamp as two or sometimes more knocked each other’s massive bodies across the landscape. In 665 Satthruphar was killed in one such battle with @UUID[.JuqcYkrHQOMobwTy#hatrumak]{Hatrumak}, Tranak’s eldest remaining son. Upon realizing that they themselves were the biggest threat to their dominion, the dragons signed a magical treaty drawn by Hatrumak, dividing the swamp into five regions with a small area deemed neutral to all. Each laired in one of the different regions with the resources in each territory belonging to the dragon within though today the swamp still sees battles between the children of Blackscale (rare as these occurrences may be).</p>\n<p><br />Not a hundred years after the Treaty Draconis, an innkeeper named Teth Aslody found a dry area east of the swamp near the Yerek Steppes; here he founded an inn named @UUID[.Tdkqx23iD22AVlLv]{Cherrian’s Rest}. It quickly became popular amongst the people traveling around the swamp until one day a small fire resulted in a massive explosion and the establishment burned down. That conflagration resulted in the discovery of black gold, an ebony sludge found naturally in the swamp that seems to feed flames—soon an export business was organized. The inn was rebuilt and a small community grew up around it; Teth died five years later and his nephew, Iramar, inherited Cherrian’s Rest along with his father’s share of the black gold operation. He set about making the enterprise much more effective and therefore profitable, and after a few years Iramar and the merchant families—which have shares in the operation—founded the Black Gold Consortium. These traders pretty much run the town of Cherrian’s Rest today, despite the mayor and council’s faulty belief of authority.</p>\n<h1><span id=\"History\">History</span></h1>\n<p><strong>Year –1200</strong><br />The mysterious ruins in the north of the Vast Swamp are abandoned by their equally mysterious builders.<br /><strong>Year –1100<br /></strong>The first human tribes settle in the Vast Swamp; they are quickly drawn into conflict with the boggards and trolls of the area.

Surnames are usually descriptive, denoting one’s profession, a great deed, or even telling of a famous ancestor.

The closer a tribe lives to a dragon’s lair, the less freedom it has, however; those who do not live in thrallbound servitude must at least offer great gifts and severe flattery from the delegations sent to the dragon to negotiate a perceived freedom for another year. This ritual of subjugation does not take place all over the swamp, but tribes within [[/roll 1d4x10]] miles of a dragon are all forced to participate.<br />This practice of flattery is unknown in the @UUID[.oIbJsrbNZu7GVWp9#the-muddy-mangroves]{Muddy Mangroves}; the King of Mud does not need the swamp to know of his existence just yet. While the dragons are considered the government in their respective regions, in Cherrian’s Rest a mayor and a council run the town—though the Black Gold Consortium is never left out of the loop and nothing happens unless they have been asked for their opinion, a thing Magistrate Alexander Gelmar is only too happy to give.</p>\n</div>","markdown":""},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{"core":{"sheetClass":"core.JournalTextTinyMCESheet"}}},{"sort":400000,"name":"Geography","type":"text","_id":"oIbJsrbNZu7GVWp9","title":{"show":false,"level":1},"image":{},"text":{"format":1,"content":"<div class=\"aventyr\"><p class=\"s5\">Geography</p><p>The Vast Swamp is in many ways unremarkable from other regions like it, filled with bogs and mangrove trees. Along the torn coast the water slowly progresses from salty to brackish, eventual filtering into freshwater that pervades the six distinctive regions of the swamp. While the dragons that live in five of the regions are of the same type, their individual desires and interests have shaped their abodes into vastly different landscapes over the course of a few centuries. Below are short introductions to each region, each bearing the names given in the Treaty Draconis.</p><h2><span id=\"The_Tangled_Forest\">The Tangled Forest</span></h2><p>The domain of @UUID[.JuqcYkrHQOMobwTy#hatrumak]{Hatrumak }(the eldest of Tranak Blackscale’s surviving children, and an accomplished necromancer in his own right) is by far the darkest and most twisted of the draconic realms in the Vast Swamp. Once home to beautiful, serene scenes with mangrove trees and colorful birds, today plants stand in stale pools of poisonous swamp water, the vivid avians long gone. The closer to Hatrumak’s lair one journeys the more poisonous the landscape gets but before any travelers can get too close, they have to deal with the tribes of ghouls that prowl through the landscape. When Hatrumak drafted the Treaty Draconis he gave himself the northern part of the Vast Swamp: serene, vibrant bogs where Satthruphar was said to have her lair.<br />None of Blackscale’s offspring wanted the northern reaches, an area deemed worthless by Hatrumak’s siblings, but the dragon discovered ancient, mysterious ruins close to the border with @UUID[JournalEntry.RMK7HBFDlPXDiURg]{Naera Cull}. Hatrumak believes that the legendary secret weapon that killed his father is somehow connected to those ruins, and he deliberately killed Satthruphar to take over her domain before drafting the Treaty Draconis to ensure he could study his findings without interference from his siblings. If his brothers and sisters were to find out that he engineered the whole incident leading to the Treaty Draconis to further his own agenda, they would immediately move against him. However, should Hatrumak’s theories on the ancient ruins prove to be correct and should he discover the mysterious weapon, his siblings will be in for a surprise indeed.</p><h3>Ancient Ruins</h3><p>In the north of the @UUID[.oIbJsrbNZu7GVWp9#the-tangled-forest]{Tangled Forest} are the mysterious remnants of an ancient city; none know who built it, or even how or why they did so. The half-submerged grey stone buildings lead to stone corridors that pierce deep into the swamp (some still dry, whereas others have been flooded for centuries). Most of the markings on the ruins have eroded into unrecognizable shapes, although the word Frothor is clearly visible on several buildings and its meaning continues to elude @UUID[.JuqcYkrHQOMobwTy#hatrumak]{Hatrumak}. The dragon has been actively trying to capture adventuring bands to force them to explore the area for him in exchange for their freedom (an offer he has yet to keep his word on) and a few months ago one such band brought back a stone depicting a battle between dragons and several different humanoid shapes. In his excitement Hatrumak almost forgot to eat the adventures, though his vile servants quickly remedied that mistake.</p><h2>Mire of Poison</h2><p>Nestled in between the Tangled Forest and the Torn Coast lay a region home to the highest concentration of rare and poisonous plants—the ad-hoc realm of the self-appointed Queen of Poison, @UUID[.JuqcYkrHQOMobwTy#allunhandra]{Allunhandra}. Far and away the most elusive of the brethren of Tranak Blackscale, she is rarely seen; when she is observed, it is mostly by ships as she flies out over the coast and turns north. No one knows where she goes after that, most believing that she merely patrols her domain. The truth is far darker than mere roaming, however, as Allunhandra is, in fact, the notorious procurer of poisons for several cults all over Aventyr (where she goes by the name Granny Death, after her guise of a mild-looking elderly woman).</p><p>Allunhandra always travels under invisibility when flying over the Aventyr mainland but sometimes she does not cast the spell until well out over the Bay of Genthor. She does not care much for what her siblings are up to so long as they do not meddle in her affairs. Tranak always saw something special in his youngest daughter—it was she who traveled in human guise across the Vast Swamp to poison the barbarian chieftain who killed her beloved father while the rest of his children hid and cowered in fear. The dragon slayer’s death was not enough, however, and she watched with glee as the entire tribe succumbed to the poisoned drinking water. Allunhandra prefers humans as servants but even her most trusted minions do not know that she is, in fact, Granny Death. The dragon’s pride and joy is a small laboratory in which several captured alchemists slave away to produce new and potent toxins for their mistress.</p><h3>Queen’s Garden</h3><p>Amid the mangroves stand several patches of brightly colored flowers—for a few minutes they seem a natural occurrence, but with a cursory investigation it becomes clear that they’ve been cultivated as there are distinct borders between the patches, and even small pathways to get through the garden without ruining the flowers. Here in the @UUID[.oIbJsrbNZu7GVWp9#mire-of-poison]{Mire of Poison} is where @UUID[.JuqcYkrHQOMobwTy#allunhandra]{Allunhandra’s }alchemists experiment with different plants to perfect the poisons for their mistress in a small hidden laboratory somewhere nearby. These patches of cultivation are relatively new; the old garden had to be abandoned a decade ago when one of the flowers became so poisonous that in bloom it killed any creature that wandered too near. The old garden is located 5 miles to the east of the new garden, shunned by both the wildlife in the area as well as Allunhandra’s servants.</p><h2>The Muddy Mangroves</h2><p><br />The youngest of Tranak’s children, @UUID[.JuqcYkrHQOMobwTy#trymgarx]{Trymgarx} dwells in a muddy swampland so inhospitable that only boggards and other amphibians can eke out an existence. The water is always murky and dirty, the trees are dark and have patches of mud on their trunks that seems to grow bigger ever so slowly, and it is as if the land suffers from a presence vile beyond comprehension. In the aftermath of the Treaty Draconis, Trymgarx feared for his life after the death of his beloved sister Satthruphar—as the youngest he could not protect himself against @UUID[.JuqcYkrHQOMobwTy#hatrumak]{Hatrumak}, let alone avenge his sister. The dragonling sought the attention of beings powerful enough to protect him, bartering with demons he intended to be his bodyguards. It was only when the King of Mud set foot in the swamp that Trymgarx realized his mistake; the powerful hezrou had no intention of serving a dragon, instead taking Blackscale’s child as yet another trophy. Today Trymgarx the black dragon lies at the base of the King of Mud’s throne in the @UUID[.oIbJsrbNZu7GVWp9#bastion-of-filth]{Bastion of Filth} in the muddy swamp land.<br />The King of Mud sends his minions across the Vast Swamp and beyond to determine the best time for expanding his territory. The northern border of the Muddy Mangroves consists of hardened mud where the searing conditions of the Scorched Lands make the expansion impossible, prompting the King of Mud to turn his gaze south. Presently he considers the @UUID[.oIbJsrbNZu7GVWp9#the-mangrove-maze]{Mangrove Maze} a thorn in his eye, the serene beauty of the place anathema to his own domain (seeded as it is with his dangerous servants), but @UUID[.Tdkqx23iD22AVlLv]{Cherrian’s Rest} stands between the two areas and invading the neutral territory would definitely attract unwanted attention from the dragons of the Vast Swamp. These considerations leave the King of Mud with only one other route of expansion: the @UUID[.oIbJsrbNZu7GVWp9#the-tangled-forest]{Tangled Forest}. He has increased the number of scouts sent into Hatrumak’s domain, causing more and more skirmishes between the two as a predictable result. So far his the dragon has deemed the losses to his undead servants beneath his notice, and has not moved against what he perceives as the unintelligent designs of an adolescent whelp.</p><h3>Bastion of Filth</h3><p>Standing amongst the tallest specimens of the @UUID[.oIbJsrbNZu7GVWp9#the-muddy-mangroves]{Muddy Mangroves}, the Bastion of Filth pierces the green canopy with its swirling spires. The structure itself is made of wet mud that somehow still retains enough solidity to form floors and walls—it is shaped into exquisite crenellations and spires that mimic the architectural style of the grandest castles of the @UUID[JournalEntry.QVrlu0lTv2vFtT5P]{Klavek Kingdom}. Within the Bastion of Filth demons and mud elementals serve the King of Mud’s every desire, and those that displease him are dealt with by @UUID[.JuqcYkrHQOMobwTy#trymgarx]{Trymgarx} in a suitably spectacular fashion. South of the Bastion of Filth is an area covered in a pall of dragonsbreath mist; within this madness-inducing haze there is an entrance to the feared Underworld swamp, the Dar’Spelun Slugmarsh.</p><p> </p><h2>The Mangrove Maze</h2><p><br />Southeast of @UUID[.Tdkqx23iD22AVlLv]{Cherrian’s Rest} stand majestic groves of mangrove trees, an area that seems untouched by the dragon lairing within. While it is indeed inviting and bountiful in hunting, this is all a ruse to lure in unsuspecting travelers. @UUID[.JuqcYkrHQOMobwTy#kallothrax]{Kallothrax} is a devious, evil, and somewhat lazy dragon—why hunt when the prey can be led straight to him? His lair is submerged within a veritable maze of mangroves, creating a labyrinth filled by his servants; several tribes of @UUID[.IdjkM3iKo5NPY1zu#boggards]{boggards} drive unfortunate victims deeper into the maze towards the waiting dragon, where he decides if they are to be prisoners to be toyed with or food.<br />While Kallothrax tries to keep the area looking inviting to lure in prey, there are signs of draconic infestation throughout it: slightly acidic water, twisted trees, and animal carcasses half-dissolved by acid. When the dragon is not brutalizing or torturing prisoners he has been known to attack some of the boats braving his domain to get to Cherrian’s Rest. These rare raids garner him slaves, prisoners, and food, but more importantly it sates a primal need to take flight and reign destruction; after sowing chaos to his satisfaction he can turn his attention back to his cruel games, much to the despair of his unfortunate prisoners. Recently Kallothrax discovered that the lightly guarded caravans of the Yerek Steppes to be easy pickings and in the southern steppes he is spoken of in hushed whispers, “lest you speak the Black Scourge’s name and he comes for you at dusk.”</p><h3>The Dreaming Fields</h3><p>This dry area in the @UUID[.oIbJsrbNZu7GVWp9#the-mangrove-maze]{Mangrove Maze} (near the Yerek Steppes) has various flowers that give off a mild narcotic as they bloom, causing humanoids and animals to drift off into sleep. There have been a few attempts to harvest the flowers to distill them into a recreational drug, but so far nearly all of these experiments have met with failure. Hathro Dunelle was behind the latest major attempt but has instead turned his attention to the unfortunate travelers that enter the fields. His men are using magical breathing covers to protect themselves and collect the sleeping unfortunates, which then awaken in chains bound for slavery somewhere on Aventyr.</p><h2><span id=\"The_Jagged_Coast\">The Jagged Coast</span></h2><p>The southwestern coastline of the Vast Swamp consists of black rocks, a testament to prehistoric volcanic activity in the region. @UUID[.JuqcYkrHQOMobwTy#dreivantix]{Dreivantix} lairs deep within, so vile that his scales secrete a potent acid that leaks into the swamp waters, giving the bogs and marshes here slightly acidic properties (which increase in potency closer to his lair). The dragon formed the black coastal rocks himself, using his breath to make what looks like unnatural tears in the stones, as though some gigantic beast tried to claw its way into the swamp. He did so as a show of his power, terraforming the entire coastline into a testament to his strength. All of Dreivantix’s slaves display his draconic rune somewhere on their bodies, burned into their skin with claw and acid. He has no preference for a particular race of slaves—as long as they have a patch of skin to display his rune on their bodies.</p><h3>Blackstone Fortress</h3><p>This half overgrown fortress on the @UUID[.oIbJsrbNZu7GVWp9#the-jagged-coast]{Jagged Coast} is the lair of a tribe of green-scaled @UUID[.IdjkM3iKo5NPY1zu#blackstone-kobolds]{kobolds} as well as several odd assassin vines that curiously do not attack the little reptilians. Located close to the region which contains Cherrian’s Rest the fortification offers the kobolds some measure of protection from Dreivantix (who lairs closer to the coast). Blackstone fortress was originally built by a forgotten warlord as an attempt to control the area but as so many other attempts to do so, only the ruins remain today as a reminder of the folly it is to try and tame the Vast Swamp.</p><h2><span id=\"Tomb_of_Satthruphar\">Tomb of Satthruphar</span></h2><p>This stretch of swampland is named after the dragon Satthruphar. @UUID[.JuqcYkrHQOMobwTy#hatrumak]{Hatrumak} lured her into the area and over the fields of fire, then used his claws, teeth, and spells to tire her before she fell into the fields, dying in the flaming inferno as her murderous brother circled above. By chance (or misfortune) this area was also where the @UUID[.Tdkqx23iD22AVlLv]{Cherrian’s Rest }inn was founded.</p><h2>Black Gold Island</h2><p>This dry area west of Cherrian’s Rest is the premier extraction facility for the Black Gold Consortium’s operations in the Vast Swamp.</p><h2>Fields of Fire</h2><p>South of Cherrian’s Rest are massive areas of swamp so saturated with black gold that even the smallest spark can ignite them. They occasionally catch fire on their own but sometimes they get ignited by outside forces (such as in 665 when Hatrumak used them to kill Satthruphar). Unsubstantiated local legends claim the fields have been burning since before Tranak Blackscale’s arrival.</p><p> </p><p> </p></div>","markdown":""},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{"core":{"sheetClass":"core.JournalTextPageSheet"}}},{"sort":500000,"name":"Cultural groups","type":"text","_id":"IdjkM3iKo5NPY1zu","title":{"show":false,"level":1},"image":{},"text":{"format":1,"content":"<div class=\"aventyr\">\n<p class=\"s5\">Cultural groups</p>\n<h2>Blackstone Kobolds</h2>\n<p>Kobolds are quite rare in the swamp proper but where the land is dry and the conditions ripe for plunder, the kobold tricksters of Traskoria can be found. These miscreants are all originally spawned from a place dubbed “Blackstone” by the little beasties, @UUID[.oIbJsrbNZu7GVWp9#blackstone-fortress]{a large fortress} overgrown with dangerous plants such as assassin vines (though the malicious plants mysteriously do not attack the ample population of kobolds around them), in the Torn Coast region near the the border with Satthruphar.</p>\n<h2>Bog Trolls</h2>\n<p>One species of troll dominates nearly all of the vast swamp—the bog troll raider. With a range of 40 miles these nasty creatures make life miserable for every humanoid attempting to eke out an existence here. There are two types of bog trolls: hunters which live in the wild, subsisting on a diet of bog toads and giant salamanders, and raiders which are much more dangerous to travelers and band together in groups of 4 or more to attack human ships moving through the Vast Swamp. The raiders consistently find their bellies full and their hidden treasure hordes well stocked, killing, cooking, and eating humanoids only after stripping them of all valuables. Then they hide their treasure somewhere deep in the swamp, sometimes forgetting where their spoils have been concealed.</p>\n<h2>Boggards</h2>\n<p>Little is known of the boggard tribes of the Vast Swamp. Rumors persist of individuals lost in the bogs being kidnapped and sacrificed by the frog creatures to some ancient deity which has not been seen in the world for many centuries.</p>\n<h2>Ghouls</h2>\n<p>Several tribes of ghouls live in the north of the Vast Swamp, all of them under the thrall of @UUID[.JuqcYkrHQOMobwTy#hatrumak]{Hatrumak}. Ghouls can be found in all the regions but not in the same dense concentration as in the Tangled Forest.</p>\n<h2>Humans</h2>\n<p>Humans are the most predominant race of the Vast Swamp and the most unpredictable. They can fill any role in the consortium, often taking on multiple tasks in the community as well; almost every human in the swamp has worked for the Black Gold Consortium at one time or another.</p>\n<p>The human barbarian tribes who call the Vast Swamp home are as varied and diverse as humans elsewhere in Aventyr. In the @UUID[.oIbJsrbNZu7GVWp9#the-mangrove-maze]{Mangrove Maze} the Moonhowlers practice their vile hedonistic rituals, boasting a formidable proportion of lycanthropes among their number, while the Torn Coast’s Tribe of the Crocodile worships a large fiendish reptilian, and the demon-hunting Bloodclaw tribe in the @UUID[.oIbJsrbNZu7GVWp9#the-muddy-mangroves]{Muddy Mangroves} proves to be a constant nuisance to the @UUID[.JuqcYkrHQOMobwTy#the-king-of-mud]{King of Mud}.</p>\n<h2>Ratfolk</h2>\n<p>In its early years small skirmishes broke out between factions of the Black Gold Consortium—small scale warfare left the Gelmar, Asoldy, and Celfal families scrambling for soldiers. Seeing the opening niche in the swamp, a regiment of hardened ratfolk crossbow troops were employed to bolster the might of these families. The kin of the marksmen came into the swamp after their relatives decided to settle and there is now a saying: on every corner of the market in @UUID[.Tdkqx23iD22AVlLv]{Cherrian’s Rest} there’s a ratfolk peddler selling his wares (even when the gold dries up).</p>\n<h2>Halflings</h2>\n<p>Halflings are often called upon when the Black Gold Consortium needs something done in a tight spot. Small folk can often find employment cleaning or fixing in-between the cogs of extraction centers, or removing blockages in tall chimneys or long pipes; the work is always dangerous, so they expect to be paid well. The Neliton family is one of the core families in the consortium and in charge of halfling relations in @UUID[.Tdkqx23iD22AVlLv]{Cherrian’s Res}t. The family’s easy going nature has protected them from the internal conflicts of the consortium—they love to show off their strong sense of fashion. The Nelitons are the trendsetting family of the Consortium, often wearing the finest garments and jewels just to show off their lavishness and to invoke the jealousy of the other families.</p>\n<h2>Elves</h2>\n<p>Magic is used by the Black Gold Consortium to speed up extraction and enhance the efficiency of its workers, tasks excelled at by elven mages and alchemists—it spends a hefty sum to these scholars if they can provide results. @UUID[JournalEntry.QlctNkzE9injOde9.JournalEntryPage.ei36LjIhEoh87vgE]{Elves}  reluctantly take the money for their services but their true reasons for inhabiting the area remain hidden from the Black Gold Consortium. The elves’ love of nature is always paramount and the reason why they are truly working with them is to see that the business does not damage the ecosystem of the swamp. Magic means of extraction are cleaner and less damaging to the area, and there are whispers of a secret order of elven saboteurs who work towards stopping any forms of extraction that the elves do not approve of.</p>\n<h2>Half-Orcs</h2>\n<p>Usually @UUID[JournalEntry.QlctNkzE9injOde9.JournalEntryPage.7AP9WRRk8pR9xpgU]{Half-Orc} are viewed with distrust and fear, but unlike the rest of the world, in the Vast Swamp a they are regarded as a valuable asset to the Black Gold Consortium. Due to their strength, half-orcs often find work on the loading docks of the extraction facilities. Hailing from lands far away and arriving in seemingly ceaseless caravans called “Olive Wagons”, escaped half-orc slaves and half-orc wanderers alike often find new homes in the bogs and marshes of the Vast Swamp.</p>\n<h2>Tieflings</h2>\n<p>The infamous background of tieflings leaves many on the fringes of normal society but in the Vast Swamp any race is welcome so long as they have gold. Demon-touched find the swamp to be an oasis amongst a hostile world and to some the bogs even have a smell that appeals to their brimstone-tinged nostrils.

The Great Wyrm Tranak Blackscale reigned over all the creatures in the bogs, good and wicked, his brood growing so large that they were left with no choice but to seek out territory to the west and east. Ultimately he was defeated by a loose alliance of enslaved swamp creatures led by a courageous barbarian chieftain. After the climactic end the newly freed slaves tried to return to the ways of life they held before Tranak had claimed the area as his own. Trolls began pillaging, @UUID[.IdjkM3iKo5NPY1zu#boggards]{boggards} hid in their small mud houses as goblin tribes warred with each other, and lizardfolk clans etched out a meager existence as small bands of human merchants tried to pass around the swamp on their way to more prosperous lands in the east. Other than the building of small camps in the bogs, it was scantly touched by humans for 300 years.</p><p>The founding of a seemingly insignificant inn called Cherrian’s Rest transformed everything in the Vast Swamp. Seeing the dry portion of land in the north and noting the need for a stop along the long road taken by merchants on their trek around the bogs, a brave innkeeper named Teth Aslody built the establishment and named it after his deceased wife. Under no circumstances did he know it was sitting on one of the most lucrative and rare resources the world has ever seen—until Teth lost everything.</p><p>One day while cooking a meal for some adventures his kitchen caught on fire. In a fright the old innkeeper and his guests collected water from the swamp in an effort to put out the blaze, but in their haste they had inadvertently scooped up what was to be called “black gold” instead. When Teth tried to put out the flames with the contents of the bucket he was thrown clear into the muck from the resulting explosion. Horrified, the adventures tried frantically to quell the flames but Teth`s beloved inn was too far gone.</p><p>The wizard of the group had a very keen eye and noted that when anyone emptied the blackened sludge water over the flames, the fire grew larger rather than diminish. When the mage told the party his observations they were able to control the flames before they extended into the whole swamp, but the tavern was devastated and the old man forced to rebuild it. Feeling somewhat guilt-ridden that it was their meal that caused the inferno, the group offered to escort the innkeeper to the nearest city. They all became fast friends and after a night at a campfire discussion, the adventurers found out that the old man was once a rich merchant and this was the second time he had lost almost everything and needed to rebuild. Teth kept some amount of his fortune hidden away for a time of need, however, and the money would be more than enough to rebuild his life once again.</p><p>This time the innkeeper had devised a plan after reading the wizard’s account of the explosion—the savvy old man knew that this black sludge would one day make him rich. Indebted of his new companions’ actions at trying to save his inn (and succeeding at saving his life), he offered to go into business with the adventurs. Old man Asoldy made the party promise that everything would be shared amongst them all equally, and together, they founded a small merchant consortium and extracted a modest amount of the sludgy black substance which he named “black gold.” Teth Asoldy passed away 5 years later and the business was tossed into anarchy as the adventures jockeyed for a bigger share of the profitable resource. Suffering from the brutal infighting and left severely weakened, when young Iramar Asold arrived to take over his uncle’s estate, Teth’s nephew saw that the groups was severely hampering the progress of the Black Gold Consortium, so he invited foreign merchant families to invest in it. Soon there were numerous elite traders flocking to become part of the venture and the other owners began to sell their shares. After they sold all their shares Iramar decided to call the new group of merchant families the Black Gold Consortium.</p><p>The founding of the Black Gold Consortium led to many changes to the area around the former inn; people flocked when offers to work for the Consortium spread and the settlement blossomed into a town, then a city as more and more settlers from different lands came to the area. New technologies based around the black sludge were invented, such as the gas lamps that light the city at night. Specially designed swamp boats with large rotating paddles and a shallow draft were developed to aid in the logistics required to transport more and more black gold. Ultimately over the course of 150 years, the cultures of the original colonizers have become distinct and unique, leaving behind archaic and useless traditions in favor of a way of life better suited to the Vast Swamp.</p><h2>Cherrian’s Rest (settlement statblock)</h2><p>Neutral small city</p><p><strong>Modifiers Crime</strong> +0, <strong>Economy</strong> +2, <strong>Law</strong> -2, <strong>Lore</strong> +0, <strong>Society</strong> +4</p><p><strong>Qualities:</strong> Insular, Notorious, Prosperous, Strategic Location</p><p><strong>Danger:</strong> 15</p><p><strong>Government:</strong> Council</p><p><strong>Population:</strong> 5,700</p><p><strong>Notable NPCs: </strong>Iramar Aslody, Head of the Black Gold Consortium (LN Male human [Klavek] expert 5)</p><p><strong>Base Value</strong> 6,827 gp; <strong>Purchase Limit</strong> 56,250 gp; <strong>Spellcasting</strong> 6th</p><p><strong>Minor Items</strong> 4d4; <strong>Medium Items</strong> 3d4; <strong>Major Items</strong> 1d6</p></div>","markdown":""},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}}],"flags":{"cf":{"id":null},"core":{"sourceId":"Compendium.Aventyr-Campaign-Setting.aventyr-campaign.g4odaMsHbRkeNFhn"},"scene-packer":{"hash":"ccb29663a8b0242b7eccd7154fdd1a2f61234e86"}},"_stats":{"systemId":"dnd5e","systemVersion":"2.1.4","coreVersion":"10.291","createdTime":1664097018913,"modifiedTime":1675795621820,"lastModifiedBy":"EsIYTtNnjwxUbKOG"},"_id":"g4odaMsHbRkeNFhn","ownership":{"default":0,"R5IsvMTH5P79pBoG":3},"folder":"j9cXBagzZ1ARsO2I","sort":1100000},{"name":"Vikmordere","pages":[{"name":"Vikmordere","type":"text","_id":"U0BsD4hsNZmyzTxq","title":{"show":false,"level":1},"image":{},"text":{"format":1,"content":"<div class=\"aventyr\">\n<p class=\"s5\">Vikmordere</p>\n<img style=\"display:block;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto\" src=\"modules/aaw-games-aventyr/Setting-images/Vikmordere-map.webp\" width=\"443\" height=\"470\" />\n<p> </p>\n<img style=\"float:right;margin:0px 10px 10px 0px;border:0px\" src=\"modules/aaw-games-aventyr/Setting-images/Vikmordere-Resounding-Bodhran.png\" width=\"198\" height=\"400\" />\n<p>The word Vikmordere can be used either to describe the region in which the barbarian people live or the people themselves. Most of the Vikmordere people live in an area of wilderness known as the Vikmordere Valley, enveloped by the @UUID[JournalEntry.QVrlu0lTv2vFtT5P]{Klavek Kingdom}.</p>\n<h2>History</h2>\n<p>Modern written history does not record when the Vikmordere took hold of this region. The oldest texts of the Klavek Kingdom recall a massive settlement of Vikmordere that encompassed not only the Eastern Mountain region, but the plains beyond into what is now the Klavek Kingdom. It is unknown how the Vikmordere were reduced in number, but their populace was diminished and they withdrew to higher elevations. They sought refuge in the frigid snow covered eastern mountains. This is the only region in the world where the Vikmordere still survive (and thrive).</p>\n<img style=\"display:block;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto\" src=\"modules/aaw-games-aventyr/Setting-images/sm-Raiding-Clan-Jarls.webp\" width=\"404\" height=\"525\" />\n<h2>Geography</h2>\n<p> </p>\n<img style=\"float:right;margin:0px 10px 10px 0px;border:0px\" src=\"modules/aaw-games-aventyr/Setting-images/Vikmordere-Snekkja-of-Rowing-1-480x579.png\" width=\"284\" height=\"343\" />\n<p>Vikmordere territory encompasses the entire Vikmordere Valley save the Rybalkan Peninsula.</p>\n<p>The mountains which protect the valley are a rugged and dangerous environment with few routes or trails which connect. The summit of most peaks is packed with snow and ancient glaciers, a cold unforgiving wilderness where few creatures can survive. The lower peaks are covered in pine trees which dot their way down sharp slopes and over rugged hills up to the edge of the @UUID[JournalEntry.ismpCNWpGHvB1iPw.JournalEntryPage.Erya8w29cRTTJELu]{Serpent Lake}.</p>\n<p>Serpent Lake and the Vikmordere Valley contain most of the flora and fauna of the region. The lake’s edge makes for the perfect Vikmordere gathering place for camping and telling stories while feasting. When in danger, the Vikmordere take to the mountains and disappear into inhospitable lands where few can follow, let alone survive.</p>\n<p>The @UUID[.U0BsD4hsNZmyzTxq#boreal-forest]{Boreal Forest} stretches along the southernmost parts of the Serpent Lake and consists of a mix of spruce, pines, birch, larches and tranteum trees.</p>\n<h1>Boreal Forest</h1>\n<h2>Weather</h2>\n<p>The winters in this part of the world, with average temperatures below freezing, last six to eight months. Temperatures vary from −54 °C to 30 °C (-65 °F to 86 °F) throughout the whole year. The summers, while short, are generally warm. In large parts of this region, -20 °C would be a typical winter day temperature and 18 °C an average summer day. Snow may remain on the ground for as long as nine months.</p>\n<p>Precipitation is low; rain does fall during the short summer, but mostly it’s snow and fog, the latter coming from the thawing of the frozen Serpent Lake starting in late spring. Due to the fog, sunshine is not abundant in the boreal forest of the region, even during the long summer days, but there is enough moisture to sustain a dense forest growth.</p>\n<h2>Flora</h2>\n<p>The forest along the southern parts of the @UUID[JournalEntry.ismpCNWpGHvB1iPw.JournalEntryPage.Erya8w29cRTTJELu]{Serpent Lake} consists of a mix of spruce, pines, birch, larches and @UUID[.U0BsD4hsNZmyzTxq#tranteum-tree]{tranteum trees}.</p>\n<p>Due to the cold, the soil is thin and poor in nutrients. Fallen leaves and moss can remain on the forest floor for a long time in the cool, moist climate, which limits their organic contribution to the soil. Acids from evergreen needles further leach the soil, sometimes creating areas that are almost sandy and excessively drained. In other parts of the region, only lichens join the moss. In forest clearings, herbs, berries, shrubs and wildflowers can be found, among them the infamous @UUID[.U0BsD4hsNZmyzTxq#stinkberries]{Stinkberry bushes} and the dangerous Calathgar. Twisted Treants are known to have clearings as their favorite spots in this area, and act as gardening guardians, occasionally gaining the powers of a druid to complement their natural abilities.</p>\n<p>In the northern parts of the region, the closed canopied forest gives way to a more widely spaced lichen woodland, with diminished foliage on the windward side.</p>\n<p>Periodic wildfires with return times of about 50 years clear out the tree canopies, allowing sunlight to invigorate new growth on the forest floor. For some species, wildfires are a necessary part of the life cycle in the taiga; some have cones which only open to release their seed after a fire, dispersing their seeds onto the newly cleared ground.</p>\n<h3>Tranteum Tree</h3>\n<p>The tranteum tree, an evergreen, is endemic in this part of the world, its wood much sought of by elves who like to use it for bows with an especially long range. A masterwork bow out of its wood and built by an elven master has its range increment heightened by 10′. Because the sun is low in the horizon for most of the year, it is difficult for plants to generate energy from photosynthesis. Tantreum trees do not lose their leaves seasonally and are able to photosynthesize with their older leaves in late winter and spring when light is good but temperatures are still too low for new growth to commence. The ground freezes during the winter months and plant roots are unable to absorb water, so the Tantreum tree has found a unique way to store warm water beneath its bark. If released by needy creatures, the warm water is enough for one medium humanoid for a day and also heals two points of nonlethal damage from cold, but the Tantreum tree will wither and die as a result. Elven druids of the Northlands are known to get very angry should this happen.</p>\n<h3>Stinkberries</h3>\n<p>Stinkberries, which can be found in forest clearings, emit an acidic smell even before plucked, but more so once removed from the thorny twigs of the infamous Stinkberry bushes. They can be crushed easily and the resulting tar-like substance pasted on the skin, which lowers Charisma-based skill checks by 2 versus creatures with a sense of smell. They also turn the skin slightly paler. The first two days of wearing Stinkberry paste the wearer is nauseated also, then she gets used to the smell. Orcs and @UUID[JournalEntry.QlctNkzE9injOde9.JournalEntryPage.7AP9WRRk8pR9xpgU]{Half-Orc} are immune against this nauseating side effect for unknown reasons. The upside of the Stinkberries is that they drive away insects of all kinds, which is a blessing in the summer months, and also drives away dweomercats and ahlinni. Nonetheless, the usage of stinkberry paste is forbidden in the villages @UUID[JournalEntry.QVrlu0lTv2vFtT5P.JournalEntryPage.EMzVKZQWrG8a60Xj#drakkal]{Drak’kal} and @UUID[JournalEntry.QVrlu0lTv2vFtT5P.JournalEntryPage.EMzVKZQWrG8a60Xj#sunglor]{Sunglor}, but not in @UUID[JournalEntry.QVrlu0lTv2vFtT5P.JournalEntryPage.EMzVKZQWrG8a60Xj#torrent]{Torrent}, which regularly leads to lots of comments among the @UUID[JournalEntry.QlctNkzE9injOde9.JournalEntryPage.DXD1ygEckY0JIUFB]{Human (Klavekian)} from those three villages. The contents of an average stinkberry bush is enough to paste two medium humans. The effects last for seven days.</p>\n<h2>Fauna</h2>\n<p>The cold winters and short summers make the taiga a challenging habitat for reptiles and amphibians, which depend on environmental conditions to regulate their body temperatures, and there are only a few species in this part of the world. Some hibernate underground in winter.</p>\n<p>The @UUID[.U0BsD4hsNZmyzTxq#boreal-forest]{boreal forest} is home to a number of large herbivorous mammals, such as moose, reindeers, elks and caribous. There is also a range of rodent species including beavers, squirrels and some species of hares. Some larger mammals, such as bears, eat heartily during the summer in order to gain weight, and then go into hibernation during the winter. Other animals have adapted layers of fur or feathers to insulate them from the cold.</p>\n<p>The biggest herbivores in the region are the mammoth, the mastodon, the woolly rhino and its even bigger cousin, the elasmotherium. Unlike to the nearby plains, where they roam in vast herds, the forest contains but singles or families of those large animals.</p>\n<p>Predators like owls, eagles, foxes and weasels feed on rodents and are themselves sometimes hunted by the bigger predators. Those include the great cats like the lynx, snow leopards, cave lions, smilodons and white tigers and also by the wolverines, including their bearlike dire wolverine cousins. The wolves are a close second among the most variant hunters, ranging from normal wolves and terror wolves up to the dreaded dire wolves and winter wolves. Notable is also another great cat, the unique and stealthy missing lynx, the forest drake and the many-colored Ahlinni, a flightless predatory bird.</p>\n<p>Omnivores like bears, dire bears (cavebears) and raccoons are present also.</p>\n<p>Insects have also carved their niche in the northern forest, and not only the swarms of flying pests that fill the summer airs. Monstrous insects in the north are the feared white-and-silver, cold generating gelid beetles, which come in small and large variants, the giant tarantula spider and the dreaded weaverworm, which many sages count under Aberrations also.</p>\n<p>Rumors speak of a green dragon in the forest, or a white one in variants, and also a few linnorms, but if such large predators are indeed living in the regions no one has survived an encounter with them yet. No rumor are the large taiga giants who roam the forest to hunt the megafauna.</p>\n<h2>Fey</h2>\n<p>Surprisingly Fey are rare in the boreal forest at the @UUID[JournalEntry.ismpCNWpGHvB1iPw.JournalEntryPage.Erya8w29cRTTJELu]{Serpent Lake}, with the Mimi the sole exception. Sage speculate that they were driven out by their brethren in the @UUID[JournalEntry.ismpCNWpGHvB1iPw.JournalEntryPage.zUmf61j380tilNZt]{Dark Wood} further north, but why this may have happened, if at all, nobody knows or talks about. The Mimi are gathered in tribes of up to 80 fey and could be a big force in such numbers if they ever chose to.</p>\n<p>A few Kitsune families are known to live in the forest, but they give the Mimi tribes a wide berth.</p>\n<p>Some people count the dweomercats as well as the fey wolverines as faeries. While the fey wolverine is more undisputed in this category and even has a fitting name, the dweomercat is a creature of the first world. How it got to the Klavekian lands at all is the stuff of many discussions.</p>\n<p>Another creature of dubious origin is the smoke haunt who attacks woodcutters and others emerging from their campfire. A local tale, sung by the skalds of the three villages at the Serpent Tail River, tell a story linking it to the fey, but if this is fictitious or based on facts is up to discussion.</p>\n<h1>Government</h1>\n<p> </p>\n<img style=\"display:block;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto\" src=\"modules/aaw-games-aventyr/Setting-images/sm-Serpent_Lake_Region-Grid-768x960.webp\" width=\"447\" height=\"773\" />\n<p> </p>\n<img style=\"float:right;margin:0px 10px 10px 0px;border:0px\" src=\"modules/aaw-games-aventyr/Setting-images/Vikmordere-Warrior-Wizard-Marak-the-Raven-480x584.webp\" width=\"257\" height=\"313\" />\n<p>The Vikmordere are loosely organized in groups or tribal clans of 50 or more per encampment.

These people now collectively make up what the Vikmordere call the “@UUID[Compendium.Aventyr-Campaign-Setting.aventyr-campaign.dOJJ8mRNTPtoihmF.JournalEntryPage.l22xqVPei8b2u04P]{Ancestor Spirit}” which drives everything they do.</p>\n<p>As legend has it, the Ancestor People lived in this world long ago and used amazing magic to travel the entire world and shape it as they saw fit. They made the mountains, the rivers, the forests, and the streams and then they began to build cities. Over many generations, the Ancestor People lost touch with Nature and the world they created, instead opting to live in cities and laying waste to the gifts their ancestors forged for them.</p>\n<p>Finally, a wise man came from the south who had not forgotten the ways of their people. He saved the Ancestor People from plagues and famines and taught them to hunt and gather in the forests and live free in the world. Within just a few generations, the people had returned to their former life. At this time a pledge was made with Mother Nature to always protect and respect her ways and to join her spirit force when one dies. Thus the Ancestor Spirit began to grow and evolve; now it is strong and the wild world lives again. The Vikmordere will never lose their way in the world and will fight to stay free and destroy the “city people” and their evil ways.</p>\n<h1>Religion</h1>\n<p> </p>\n<img style=\"float:right;margin:0px 10px 10px 0px;border:0px\" src=\"modules/aaw-games-aventyr/Setting-images/Vikmordere-Spirit-Stones-480x579.png\" width=\"228\" height=\"276\" />\n<p>@UUID[JournalEntry.dOJJ8mRNTPtoihmF.JournalEntryPage.l22xqVPei8b2u04P]{The Ancestor Spirit} guides all of the Vikmordere people and asks them to respect the land, mountains, trees, animals, and plants of the world.</p>\n<p>Totem poles are carefully crafted by woodworkers under the guidance of the Tribal Shamans and raised to give praise to the animals of the wilderness for their gifts to the world.

Most gold retained by the Vikmordere comes from raids in @UUID[JournalEntry.QVrlu0lTv2vFtT5P]{Klavekian} land.

They then return to their ships with the spoils and finish off the last section of the river which eases them into the ocean. Using the natural currents, the ships are pulled back into an inlet which leads to underground cavernous waterways. From this point the Vikmordere use a tribal secret that only the tribal elders that navigate the ships are allowed to see. Leading a crew of rowing Vikmordere men, the elders summon the @UUID[JournalEntry.dOJJ8mRNTPtoihmF.JournalEntryPage.l22xqVPei8b2u04P]{Ancestor Spirit} to show them the way to the Ancestral Gateway – a powerful permanent portal deep in the water-filled caverns.

The rugged island hosts a mix of black spruce and white pine, while birches, poplars and willows display beautiful fall colors starting in early autumn. Evenings are made memorable by breathtaking sunsets, whilst on clear nights there always is the likelihood of a appearance of the northern lights. The northern part of Crow’s Rest Island is bounded by spectacular red granite cliffs and coves that give the appearance of being magical and are mostly unexplored by humans as of now. They are inhabited by kobolds, but that may not always have been the case, since there are far older ruins on the island. The kobolds don’t look favorably on other humanoids rummaging around there and to prove this point, they leave shrunken heads and spread-eagled skeletons pinned to the cliffs. But even if they somehow could be avoided, there are also grim repositories of long-undead creatures and worse, if tales can be believed. Like so often in the North, what looks like a stunning paradise at first glance is actually only hiding its dangers behind mirages.</p>\n<p>The western sector of the island is flat, while almost mountainous relief is characteristic of the eastern part and accounts for about 70 per cent of the total area. Although absolute heights are low, the hills have steep, dissected slopes where only the sparsest vegetation and the hardiest goats manage to eek out survival.</p>\n<h2>Fauna</h2>\n<p>Secluded bays provide some of @UUID[JournalEntry.ismpCNWpGHvB1iPw.JournalEntryPage.Erya8w29cRTTJELu]{Serpent Lake} most important waterfowl habitats, and, to the delight of every fisherman with the courage to brave the dangers of the sea serpents, they teem with lake trout and northern pike. While golden and bald eagles abound, Crow’s Rest Island is known for its migratory bird life, aside from the name-giving crows, there are ducks, geese and loons as fellow summer visitors.</p>\n<p>Terrestrial mammals are mainly linked with the forest: brown bear, wolves, foxes, sable, and red squirrels have crossed the ice in especially cold winters and made a home on the island. Foxes are ubiquitous, and without the crows, it would in all likelihood have been known as the ‘island of foxes’ long ago. Such abundance of this species has provoked rumors of Kitsune living here too, either impersonating most of the foxes or at least living among them in hiding. The existence of pond drinkers may be a clue toward this, but it is unproven nonetheless.</p>\n<p>Perhaps the most distinguishing feature of Crow’s Rest Island is the abundance of sea mammals which form beach colonies in the west. In addition to the sea lion and common seal, widespread in the Serpent Lake, there are colonies of two rare species, the six-legged Zantula (see below) and the giant sea otter. Crow’s Rest Island lies on one of the major migration routes of birds nesting in the North. More than two dozen bird species are known to pass and rest here in times. Marine birds and crows are particularly common and form extensive colonies on the coastal cliffs in the north and the forest respectively.</p>\n<p>The coastlines of the Crow’s Rest Island are plagued by almost all the creatures that are common to the Klavekian Lakeside, so you can see the details in that part. Further inland, forest creatures prevail, but since there is no megafauna on the island, the predators tend to be smaller here compared to the mainland. There’s no reason for adventurers to relax, though, for the predators like the wolves are known to hunt in packs and the kobolds are numerous and cunning. Some of the scaly humanoids have dire rat mounts, and there is at least one sorcerer, maybe an ice kobold, known to be on the island. There also are more undead than one would think, and they are not only inside the ancient ruins. Among these undead, the cadavers have to be mentioned, for it seems to be very difficult to lay them to eternal rest. The kobolds usually avoid cadavers and the even more dangerous cadaver lords for this reason.</p>\n<p>The six-legged, vermin-like pond drinkers are rare around the Serpent Lake, but they are more common on Crow’s Rest Island. These blood drinkers are rumored to have banished the fey from the island, with the possible exception of the kitsune, and are now plaguing the kobolds and sometimes fishermen coming to close to the coastline.</p>\n<p>With its ability to prepare itself for long, cold winters by consuming huge quantities of aquatic insects, snails, small fish and fish eggs, and to survive for up to six months under several meters of ice if need be, the Zantula is well adapted to the Serpent Lake’s northern parts and likely to be found along shorelines and in shallower bays there. That it is so abundant this far south has made sages speculate if Crow’s Rest Island’s northern coves may be the long sought-after breeding ground for the strange mammals. Zantulas have an oily pelt which is surprisingly warm and gives a +2 on saving throws versus non-lethal cold damage. The oil vanishes three months after the harvesting though, and sooner if it is washed regularly. After two months, the pelt starts to stink, making its wearer and everyone downwind and closer than 20 feet distance nauseated as long as the pelt can be smelled. This can attract reefclaws, who are not above eating the occasional carcass, and the smell an old zantula pelt emits indeed reminds of a very old carcass.</p>\n<p>Sometimes known as the Vikmordere fish, because of its very large, brightly-spotted dorsal fin that reminds of a vikmordere sail, the alisfish is one of the most distinctive and attractive fish in northern waters. It is vividly colored, with an iridescent light purplish-blue back, and white sides. It also lives in the warmer parts of southern Klavekian rivers, but grows to trophy size in the cold, clear waters of Serpent Lake, reaching record weights of over four pounds, and super-lengths of 30 inches. Close study by fishermen of the alisfish’s habits has revealed that large specimen gravitate to deeper waters, with smaller fish inhabiting medium depths. Zantulas, seadrakes and tentamorts alike hunt the Alisfish, so it is very dangerous to compete with the latter monsters, but a small bay on the northern side of Crow’s Rest Island is known to be a location were it is easy to harvest Alisfish, if one survives the competition. It is very easy to bait the normally shy zantulas with alisfish to harvest their pelts (see above).</p>\n<h2>Flora</h2>\n<p>The coastline of Crow’s Rest Island is characterized by deep, clear waters and a shoreline dominated by mosses, lichens and low-growing shrubs. Further inland, black spruce, white pine and birches grow with the aforementioned spectacular colors in fall. On the western side, horsetails, sedges, wetlands filled with willows, and banks lined with mixed balsam poplar and spruce woods also provide ideal breeding habitats for ducks.</p>\n<p>Crow’s Rest Island is not known for its biological strangeness ,as most of the plants found here are common in the rest of the Klavekian realm.</p>\n<p>One exception for this is the elven berry, a highly nutritious, orange-colored fruit from the Klavekian willow, which is indigenous to the eastern shore of the southern @UUID[JournalEntry.ismpCNWpGHvB1iPw.JournalEntryPage.Erya8w29cRTTJELu]{Serpent Lake} and some of its islands. Despite being a little berry, the elven berry is considered by some to be one of the more useful foods found in the Klavekian realm today. It is a fruit having a short post-harvest period, after which it tends to deteriorate. That is why elven berry is available only as juice fruit pulp outside the North. This juice and pulp are used in numerous local beverages for its spicy taste, but a successful Craft (Alchemy) check DC 20 can produce a product that is able to enhance the normal eyesight for 20 feet for 2d6 rounds. Low-light or darkvision are not enhanced by the elven berry. The enhancing quality is the reason for the name of the berry, though a human still can’t compete with elven eyesight, however much elven berry beverage he has consumed.</p>\n<p>Another berry that bears mentioning here does it for warning purposes only. The saliberry is a blue fleshfruit with many seeds inside and has the size of an average sword pommel. Like the elven berry, it grows mainly on the southeastern part of Serpent Lake and some islands. Saliberries are thought by some to be a highly effective weight loss food, although no magic evidence exists to prove this statement. Indeed sages claim that consuming a certain amount of fresh saliberries causes the delusion of an immediate loss of weight, obviously some illusionary defense mechanism of the berry versus its natural enemies. The delusion lasts for about eight hours and can be disbelieved as usual. Victims of saliberries who want to believe in the fruits do get no saving throws, more sceptically minded eaters have to succeed a will saving throw DC 5. This is a mind-affecting (compulsion) effect. Saliberries have a bitter taste and are sometimes served with bloodhawkwings to complement the flavor.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n</div>","markdown":""},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"sort":0,"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}}],"flags":{"scene-packer":{"hash":"f4a22b344d6e36f05e7bf33382c00df35bfb095f","sourceId":"JournalEntry.Cg0Nt8mDPQ7JrmyB"},"cf":{"id":null},"core":{"sourceId":"Compendium.Aventyr-Campaign-Setting.aventyr-campaign.Cg0Nt8mDPQ7JrmyB"}},"_stats":{"systemId":"dnd5e","systemVersion":"2.1.4","coreVersion":"10.291","createdTime":1663427672675,"modifiedTime":1675797603086,"lastModifiedBy":"EsIYTtNnjwxUbKOG"},"_id":"Cg0Nt8mDPQ7JrmyB","ownership":{"default":0,"R5IsvMTH5P79pBoG":3},"folder":"j9cXBagzZ1ARsO2I","sort":400000},{"name":"Yerek Steppes","pages":[{"sort":100000,"name":"Yerek Steppes","type":"text","_id":"9qnqPShRDAbXxvDG","title":{"show":false,"level":1},"image":{},"text":{"format":1,"content":"<div class=\"aventyr\">\n<p class=\"s5\">Yerek Steppes</p>\n<img style=\"display:block;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto\" src=\"modules/aaw-games-aventyr/Setting-images/Yerek-Steppes-map.webp\" width=\"381\" height=\"574\" />\n<p>The Yerek Steppes are home to the Yerek people, a semi-nomadic group that moves north, closer to the @UUID[JournalEntry.b1DKjyyIAffVIzX1]{Scorched Lands}, in the winter and the southern border of the the steppes, near the sea, in the summer.

Yerek speakers use the word “yerekai” to mean “that (specific) wanderer.” Yerek names tend to be short, as to allow for quicker communication. There are no surnames in the Yerek language. Nicknames are discouraged, as these are seen as an insult to the names that are thought to be given to by child’s mother by Musta’vohi herself. This does not prevent some Yerek from acquiring nicknames from non-Yerek.

Boys are girls are considered adults when they can make the journey without help from any other members of the tribe. Until that point, all children are raised in Purus-thal under the watchful eye of the Mothers of the tribe.</p>\n<p>Upon returning from their first journey, the newly anointed adults are the guests of honor at a large feast in Purus-thal. Once the feast is finished, both the boys and girls are sent on their final test to prove adulthood. With no weapons and only a small sack with a little food and what the child deems necessary, they are sent into the wilds of the steppes. Their objective is to return with enough meat to replace what the feast has consumed or more, if possible. They have one week to complete this task.</p>\n<p>As the children are taught to make knives from flint and stone, the most successful return from their hunt bearing meat and skins and carrying knives made with handles from the antlers of the deer of the northern steppes or more formidable weapons made from the antlers of the elk and moose that live in the southern grasslands.</p>\n<p>Those that return with nothing or very little are relegated back to the status of child and are required to make the walk again before they take part in the hunt.</p>\n<p>Occasionally, a child does not return at all. In these cases, there is a twenty-four hour vigil held by the adults of the tribe. They are mourned and an offering of food and gifts are given to the parents, who are relieved of any tribal duties for one week.</p>\n<p>Other than the walk, the most recognized part of Yerek society is that the women of the tribe, down to the smallest infant girl, is considered a divine gift from Musta’Vohi. While men and women work side by side as equals, any serious decisions are made by the eldest female in attendance. If there is no female of age to have children present, the eldest male will make decisions.</p>\n<p>This does not mean that women in the tribe are treated as royalty. The opposite, in fact. They work just as hard as their male counterparts in all aspects of life. This is because the Yerek figured out long ago that everyone needed to work together if their people were to survive.</p>\n<p>Yerek children are taught survival skills at a young age. They learn things like how to hunt, farm, and live off of the land as well as how to make various weapons.</p>\n<p>Ariun Uudor is celebrated during the first week of each month. A single day of the week is set aside for a festive celebration honoring Musta’Vohi. Songs are sung and tales are told. Thanks are given for blessed unions and healthy children, while those who have had less than beautiful marriages still offer her supplication, so that they may have another chance to find love.</p>\n<p>Every male Yerek must also learn the gazar. These are capering dances performed while the dinner meal of Ariun Uudor is being prepared. Everyone changes their clothing into a bright, colorful outfit which is designed to present liveliness against the coming darkness. During the gazar, the women of the tribe sing the duu, songs of praise to Musta’Vohi, thanking her for their continued prosperity and to pray for easy, painless pregnancies, and healthy children.</p>\n<h2>Physical Characteristics</h2>\n<p>The Yerek people are, on average, short and stocky, looking like tall Dwarves to some. Occasionally, dweorg are found in Purus-thal as they travel from one place to another, which adds to the confusion. The Dwarves and the Yerek share many similarities in both attitude and outlook. While the Yerek are not a pessimistic people, the overwhelming attitude is “what will be, will be.”</p>\n<p>Both men and women of the Yerek stand approximately 5 feet tall, with slight various between 4’10” and 5’3″. Never in recorded Yerek history has there been anyone over 5’6″. The men usually weigh between 150 and 175 pound with the women being only slightly lighter.</p>\n<p>The men generally keep their hair short, usually, while the women usually wear theirs long although the opposite is seen as well . Hair is almost uniformly black, although very dark brown is not uncommon. Younger Yerek, especially those making their first walk, tend to have lighter hair due to sun exposure. Some women dye their hair with the juices of fruits, such as the anar for red or the ners for blue.</p>\n<p>Brown eyes are the most common color. Dark blue and dark green eyes make up about ¼ of the Yerek population, while lighter colors are almost nonexistent.</p>\n<h2>Farming</h2>\n<p>On the walk from end to end of the steppes, a large variety of ox called an uhker (oo-ker) is used to carry belongings. In general, these oxen are well-behaved, but do not tolerate cruelty for very long. Standing just over five feet tall at the shoulder, almost eight feet long, and weighing close to a full ton, these animals are respected by their drivers. Those that try to bully an uhker are often left in a bloody heap with broken bones.</p>\n<p>The uhker are also used in the western steppes near the border with the @UUID[JournalEntry.g4odaMsHbRkeNFhn]{Vast Swamp}. It is here that the Yerek grow crops to supplement their meat- and wheat-heavy diet. Uhker break apart the thick, heavy mud that make up the fields and their dung is used as fertilizer. In this area, wheat as well as thin-skinned peppers and a root vegetable called khunsni grow.</p>\n<p>The khunsni grows deep in the waterlogged soil while leaves float a few inches above on the waters surface. It can be eaten raw or chopped up and used in soup. It is sweet and crunchy when raw and adds a nutty flavor to soups.</p>\n<p>The pepper, called chinju, are bright green or red and spicy, but not overwhelming. They are also used in soups and for giving flavor to a variety of dried meats. Chinju can also be dried for storage and later use.</p>\n<p>Those that tend the fields tend to carry scythes or sickles, but clerics who help with the harvest use spiked chains altered to have small cutting blades. This allows them to harvest, but also to praise @UUID[JournalEntry.dOJJ8mRNTPtoihmF.JournalEntryPage.2wbAulHSDXQk55Q8]{Musta’Vohi} while using her favored weapon.</p>\n<h2>Technology</h2>\n<p>Given the spiciness of the chinju, the Yerek have found a way to use it as a deterrent to animals and the occasional person.</p>\n<p>The bladder of a dead uhker is taken and treated to keep the material supple. The juices and seeds of the chinju are ground up and dried. This is mixed together with water from the farmland in the west and then placed inside the bladder.</p>\n<p>A leaf from the khunsni is placed over the mouth of the bladder and has small holes poked through it.</p>\n<p>To use this device, called a shursh, the bladder is placed on the ground and stomped on or is smashed between the hands. The mixture of water and dried pepper is forced through the holes in the leaf, creating a mist that envelops a 10 foot cone in front of the bladder. The mist causing irritation to the eyes and sinuses, effectively blinding the opponent.</p>\n<p>Because walking the length of a country is hard on the feet, the Yerek needed some way to protect their feet on the journey. To do so, they have used the stomachs of uhker for adults or stomachs of small animals for children. They are filled with a thin later of a water and wheat dust mixture, making the water more viscous, and the stomach is sealed. The stomachs are then placed into the shoes to make walking more comfortable, as the syrupy fluid shifts back and forth with each step. A permanent mending spell is applied to these stomachs, preventing them from wearing out.</p>\n<h2>Magic</h2>\n<p>Arcane magic is virtually absent from the Yerek Steppes, but divine magic is present. This ability is generally found in the druids and rangers who look after the fields of the western steppes as they attempt to prevent wheat sickness from reappearing.</p>\n<p>Clerics follow @UUID[JournalEntry.dOJJ8mRNTPtoihmF.JournalEntryPage.2wbAulHSDXQk55Q8]{Musta’Vohi}and their role depends on how they decide to worship. If they are trained to be healers, they can be found either in the western swamps or in Purus-thal to aid with childbirth. Protectors journey with the tribesmen who walk the land.</p>\n<p>During Ariun Uudor, the clerics of that use Musta’Vohi’s ability to influence others to attempt to bring unmarried tribe members together.</p>\n<p> </p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"aventyr\">\n<h2>Significant Characters</h2>\n<p> </p>\n<h3>Grandmother Theilda</h3>\n<p>(NE, Female Yerek (human), Adept 10) – Barely sixty years old, but her body has been worn down by the constant migration of her people.

Almost directly in the middle of the Steppes is Purus-thal, home of the Grandmother and any Mothers than can no longer make the trek from north to south and back.</p><p>The center of Purus-thal is the ger, a type of portable tent, that was carried by Tani, the First Grandmother. When she could no longer make the journey, she set up her tent, proclaiming it to be Purus-thal. Since that time, each Grandmother adds her own ger to the area surround the dwellings of the previous Mothers and Grandmothers. There are more structures than people who live in Purus-thal, which the Yerek are willing to rent out to travelers. The young women of the tribe who are due to give birth will stay in Purus-thal on their next passing and will inhabit Tani’s ger during the birthing process.</p><p>All babies born to the Yerek are raised in Purus-thal by a collaborative of all birth mothers, the Mothers, and the Grandmother</p><p>To the west, where the Steppes meet the Vast Swamp, is where most of the agriculture in the Yerek Steppes originates. This area is always overseen by a shaman or a nature oriented cleric so that any recurrence of wheat sickness can be determined quickly.</p><p>To the northeast of the country, where Treeland begins to recede but before the land dries up at the Scorched Lands, there is a surprising number of fruit trees, including fig and an intensely aromatic species of lime tree that the Yerek call “idemkhii.” The entire area has a strong scent of idemkhii and lavender, which dots this fragrant landscape in clusters of small shrubs. There are other fruit trees, grasses, and herbs in this area, but the idemkhii and lavender are the most prevalent.</p><h2>Treeland</h2><p>The eastern edge of the Yerek Steppes is known as Treeland.</p><p></p><p><strong>Flag:</strong> None</p><p><strong>Loyalty:</strong> Treeland</p><p><strong>Alignment:</strong> Chaotic Neutral</p><p><strong>Export:</strong> Fruit</p><p><strong>Import:</strong> None</p><p><strong>Assets:</strong> Unknown</p><p><strong>Population:</strong> Approximately five hundred thousand (88.5% primates (non-human), 10% other animals, .5% human)</p><p><strong>Authority Figure:</strong> @UUID[Compendium.Aventyr-Campaign-Setting.aventyr-campaign.dOJJ8mRNTPtoihmF.JournalEntryPage.jjNtg5QMfe2uI6uS]{Qathindli}</p><p></p><p>Treeland was founded roughly one hundred fifty years ago by Qathindli, demigoddess of monkeys. It is ostensibly a part of the Yerek Steppes, but Qathindli has claimed it for the monkeys. The Yerek have a small population that has more than enough land, so they haven’t disputed Qathindli’s claim.</p><p>Treeland has very little history to speak of, being a young country and no one seeing any point of invading a small forest.</p><p>With just over one million square miles of land, almost entire covered in trees and shrubs, Treeland has plentiful fruits, most of which are eaten by the primate dwellers. The rest are given to the Yerek as a peace offering. The Yerek think that one fruit in particular, the forhoral, is a potent aphrodisiac.</p><p>The few humans that live in Treeland stay on the western edge of the forest. Qathindli has granted them a small parcel of land which they are using to grow vegetables to trade with Qathindli in exchange for living in the forest. At first, the humans were surprised to be visited by a talking monkey the size of a child’s doll, but they soon took her small form to be cute and almost irrelevant until she began arriving in their part of Treeland accompanied by several gorillas.</p><p></p></div>","markdown":""},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}}],"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"Compendium.Aventyr-Campaign-Setting.aventyr-campaign.NncIDs7ugdrg07c0"},"scene-packer":{"hash":"a48004fe1801e312558b5d4a99fb7c4c84f871db"}},"_stats":{"systemId":"dnd5e","systemVersion":"2.1.4","coreVersion":"10.291","createdTime":1665770125724,"modifiedTime":1675798215257,"lastModifiedBy":"EsIYTtNnjwxUbKOG"},"ownership":{"default":0,"R5IsvMTH5P79pBoG":3},"folder":"j9cXBagzZ1ARsO2I","sort":300000,"_id":"dHHrcptCELfN05gb"}],"scenes":[{"_id":"auGbDTZt0IVlKNRt","name":"Aventyr

Most frequently this is during war, where neither the unhelpful morality of good and evil nor the confusion and disorder of chaos allow for clear decisions to be made and victory achieved. The Axiomatic General appears wherever clear-thinking, considered tactics, and balanced plans are being prepared or followed. While the field of war is the usual site for these activities, the Axiomatic General has been known to appear during complicated but emotionless court cases, and sometimes even when the cold, detached clarity of true monkish enlightenment is reached.</p>\n<p>The Axiomatic General is neither male nor female, instead being a creature devoid of physically distracting bias. It can appear as a female or male of any humanoid species, whichever form is most likely to aid with clarity of decision making.</p>\n<h2>Dogma</h2>\n<p>The Axiomatic General and its followers wish to bring the clarity of law to those places that currently live in emotional turmoil and to demonstrate to all the axiomatic nature of law when applied to war, legal frameworks, and personal actions. It expects its believers to instigate and adhere to meaningful laws while at the same time exposing and amending those which are ludicrous, outlandish, convoluted, unenforceable, or contrary. The Overseer of War abhors any decision or process that allows an individual to take unfair advantage of another, either through methods such as emotional blackmail, the abuse of personal power, or as a result of chance. It encourages its followers to engage in long-term ordered “wars” rather than short-and-sharp fights—the chaos of battle is well known, but by carefully considering one’s options, testing one’s theories, and then following through with a well-conceived plan, one can make their way to victory in an ordered manner. If all around them are clear about their intentions, one can see their actions are as fair and just as possible, and that trade and public prosperity, the courts, and the growth of society as a whole can continue during even the greatest of conflicts.</p>\n<p>The Lord of All Wars promotes careful consideration in all matters and expects its followers to be able to provide self-evident truths for all their actions. Haste, guesswork, and self-indulgence lead to reliance on emotion and base, uncontrolled actions. It disapproves of reliance on government or any religious institution that fosters blind trust or, even worse, unprovable belief, explaining that those with sound judgement, mental discipline, and an unshakeable grasp of sensible, irrefutable laws can overcome the inauthentic evidence and invalid arguments of the emotional and chaotic masses.</p>\n<h2>History</h2>\n<p>Once a mortal humanoid, the Axiomatic General ascended to become deified, although it is unclear what exactly it once was as virtually all races have a legendary historical figure that has risen from the mortal ranks to those of the divine after following the path of a great warrior who tirelessly supported its deity. What is evident is that the Overseer of War became more powerful than this original deity and ended up judging it at the culmination of a long conflict. The Lord of All War’s final verdict and victory provided the energy and evidence needed for the warrior to rise to godhood itself.</p>\n<p>The Axiomatic General tends to appear in history (as the simple warrior of its humanoid type) when the race’s pre-eminent lawful deity first wages war against more than one non-lawful foe, whether they be good, evil, or chaotic. It goes by many titles (a few of which appear above) but always has the ability to make clear, concise, and entirely accurate decisions even in the heat and fog of combat. Tales invariably tell of the Overseer of War having to uphold the lawful aims and ambitions of another deity’s followers when the god or goddess itself proves to be weak and fallible. Then the Axiomatic General steps in to save those same worshipers before judging the god in question and finding it wanting. After this, it takes the fight to the enemy, turns the tide of the war with unquestionable judgement, and becomes a deity in its own right. After this, the Lord of All Wars is always found leading those who know its words to be the truth through conflict, disagreement, and dispute—a reliable route to absolute, undeniable victory.</p>\n<h2>Relationships</h2>\n<p>The Overseer of War is entirely dismissive of any and all other deities that do not in some part embrace lawful beliefs. While those that promote chaos feel its full wrath, the Axiomatic General constantly seeks to disprove the tenets of neutral good and neutral evil deities because of their reliance on sentimental or self-centred emotions. It tolerates lawful good and lawful evil gods as long as their lawful nature is at the forefront of their actions, and is just as likely to support a lawfully-minded archon in a conflict against an evil devil as it is a lawfully-minded devil that wages war against an overly-good archon; ultimately, the balance of law is what is important.</p>\n<p>The Axiomatic General is opposed by all those who promote personal choice, uncontrolled actions, and “belief”—it is guaranteed to come into conflict with deities that support and nurture bards and barbarians, and frequently with those that nurture wild sorcerers. Because it is so closely linked with conclusive and categorical truth, the Lord of All Wars sometimes finds itself on the side of sages, experts, philosophers and academics that devote their lives to uncovering a lost or hidden truth, whether military, legal, commercial, or magical.</p>\n<h2>Appearance</h2>\n<p>The Axiomatic General usually appears as a healthy, vibrant member of the appropriate race and can be either female or male (or neither). Its clothing is always practical for the situation but is clearly designed to instil confidence and invariably a bright white. The god’s symbol, the decorated iron rod, is sewn into the space above the heart and mimicked by the weapon it wields. The Overseer of War always carries a +3 axiomatic brilliant energy light mace, the look and effect of which are in line with the main domain of the senior cleric in the vicinity as follows:</p>\n<table style=\"float:left;width:99.5833%;height:113px\" border=\"1\">\n<tbody>\n<tr style=\"height:32.5px\">\n<td style=\"width:47.7664%;height:32.5px;background-color:#000000;border-color:#ffffff\">\n<h3><span style=\"color:#ffffff\"><strong>Domain</strong></span></h3>\n</td>\n<td style=\"width:52.2358%;height:32.5px;background-color:#000000;border-color:#ffffff\">\n<h3><span style=\"color:#ffffff\"><strong>Rod type</strong></span></h3>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height:20.125px\">\n<td style=\"width:47.7664%;height:20.125px;background-color:#ecf0f1;border-color:#000000\">Law</td>\n<td style=\"width:52.2358%;height:20.125px;background-color:#ecf0f1;border-color:#000000\">Alertness</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height:20.125px\">\n<td style=\"width:47.7664%;height:20.125px;background-color:#ecf0f1;border-color:#000000\">Nobility</td>\n<td style=\"width:52.2358%;height:20.125px;background-color:#ecf0f1;border-color:#000000\">Splendour</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height:20.125px\">\n<td style=\"width:47.7664%;height:20.125px;background-color:#ecf0f1;border-color:#000000\">Strength</td>\n<td style=\"width:52.2358%;height:20.125px;background-color:#ecf0f1;border-color:#000000\">Flailing</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height:20.125px\">\n<td style=\"width:47.7664%;height:20.125px;background-color:#ecf0f1;border-color:#000000\">War</td>\n<td style=\"width:52.2358%;height:20.125px;background-color:#ecf0f1;border-color:#000000\">Rulership</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>Legends dictate that the Axiomatic General occasionally appears as a fully advanced, adamantine-coated marut, but the last occasion this was recorded was many generations ago.</p>\n<h2>Providence</h2>\n<p>Followers and clergy of the Lord of All Wars know that clarity of planning, deeper understanding of the way forward, or insight into a problem that has been gained after careful thought and consideration has come from their deity. This knowledge doesn’t appear suddenly but is the reward for taking time and exploring all possibilities. The Oversee of War thinks highly of those who consider their options before acting decisively, as well as of those who follow through with long-term plans without faltering.</p>\n<p>Any sign of plans failing, the confusion reigning, or participants not understanding their role is seen as a sign that the Axiomatic General is displeased and expects greater discipline and forethought.</p>\n<h2>Servants</h2>\n<p>The Axiomatic General rewards those who organize well and keep to agreed plans, no matter how long this may take. These machinations often take many generations in the case of shorter-lived humanoids such as goblinoids and humans, or the entire life of the longest-living elves. Servants must be prepared to sacrifice the immediate for the longer term, understand that they may lose those around them today for the betterment of a lawful population tomorrow, and recognize that the needs of a lawful future outweigh any considerations here and now.</p>\n<p>The Overseer of War grants particular favour to those who constantly uphold the law—inevitables are viewed with esteem alongside formians and other hive-minded creatures. Followers that devote themselves to a lifetime of achieving a long-term lawful aim regularly receive insight and clarity from their god. Humanoids that either spend a significant portion of their time gaining greater insight into a particular path or are able to rapidly judge the features and benefits of a number of possibilities before quickly making the correct decision often gain a divine hint or two.</p>\n<h2>The Church of the Axiomatic General</h2>\n<p>Sites of worship to the Lord of All Wars serve one purpose: to ensure that correct decision are made to further indisputable truth. They range in size from an officer’s table in their tent, a simple sand tablet on which a cleric explains a truth, or in a lawyer’s or sage’s rooms, to the chambers of a country’s most magnificent courtroom, the order flags at the front line of the latest battle in a war, or the grandest library within the @UUID[JournalEntry.QVrlu0lTv2vFtT5P]{Klavek Kingdom} most spectacular cathedral to the Axiomatic General. Churches to this god are all simple, plain affairs that remove mental distraction and clutter at the same time as allowing axioms and tenets spoken by the Overseer of War to be spread effectively and efficiently.</p>\n<p>Worship of the Axiomatic General is frequently silent as followers consider practical issues at hand as well as long-term problems that require a more considered solution. Followers frequently engage in debates, most of which are serious but enjoyable affairs—there is no time for frivolous thought when the Lord of All War’s tenets are involved—although there is no sense of “victory or defeat” in these sessions (the aim is to reach the truest, most accurate solution to a question, and everybody learns something.) When necessary, churches of the Overseer of War provide a neutral meeting point between warring factions of good and evil, although only the most experienced and senior of clergy attempt to mediate between chaotic elements. The Axiomatic General has shown that the wisest course for followers of law is to work together to overcome chaos through any means possible before resolving philosophical and personal lawful differences using contemplation and debate.</p>\n<p>The clergy of the Overseer of War organize themselves in a clear and obvious hierarchy in the same way that any modern military, business, or courtroom would do. Similarly, religious and educational centres that follow the Axiomatic General have a plain structure in place that shows who has best demonstrated an understanding of the god’s aims and objectives. No matter where or how the Lord of All War is followed, its churches are defined by their grasp of unequivocal truths, unimpeachable laws, unbeatable tactics, and unquestionable enlightenment. Churches that exhibit knowledge over belief and can demonstrate undeniable evidence for these truths have the greatest standing, no matter what their size. Worshipers rise up the ranks in the same way: anyone who can establish irrefutable knowledge and information is given ever greater responsibilities. At the same time, mistakes aren’t considered a failure if the individuals concerned can show they did all they could to establish clarity and a considered answer. All they have to do is recognize that further investigation has produced better knowledge and make sure they don’t repeat the mistake. As the Lord of All Wars is happy to develop plans over many generations, errors that can be rectified bear little consequence.</p>\n<p>Churches worshipping the Axiomatic General are openly found in the centre of lawful societies and on the outskirts of those populations with no preference for law or chaos but are seemingly absent from chaotic cultures. The Overseer of War prefers his followers to surround such cultures and gradually move inwards until the chaos is crushed out of them—a process that takes as long as is necessary, designed to ensure no worshiper is tricked into joining chaos from within.</p>\n<p>Services to the Axiomatic General are ordered affairs, comprising either contemplation of the truth or respectful presentation of findings and subsequent decision-making they influence. In all situations, there is ample opportunity for everyone who wants to speak to do so, although followers recognize the need to act swiftly during war situations and develop a truncated, precise style of presenting their findings.</p>\n<h2>Worshipers</h2>\n<p>The Axiomatic General is primarily worshipped by military officers but also draws in judges, lawyers, barristers, sages, monks, and those who would advance society in an ordered and structured way. Those who indulge in chaotic thoughts and acts are ignored at all times.</p>\n<h2>Clergy</h2>\n<p>The clergy of the Overseer of War are not necessarily clerics, although if they aren’t they are only allowed to represent the god within their own sphere of expertise and influence (for example, military officers can only lead services and discussions about military matters). Any member of the clergy who is a cleric is required to lead a service in an overarching capacity even if the content is decided by the senior subject expert. In all situations, the most experience cleric leads a service, with assistance as appropriate from other members of the congregation.</p>\n<p>The Axiomatic General does not support paladins, despite their martial outlook. Their tendency towards good leads them to not always consider the balanced needs of a lawful life, which in turn means their judgment isn’t always going to be the best it can be in some situations.</p>\n<h2>Temples and Shrines</h2>\n<p>Buildings devoted to the Lord of All Wars are functional, unadorned, designed to serve all aspects of the god’s tenets, yet clearly focused on one domain more than others (whatever that may be). It isn’t unusual for there to be four temples next to each other—one for each aspect of devotion with followers visiting whichever is most appropriate for their needs.</p>\n<p>All sites of worship have one item in common: a magical lead box with an amazing lock that holds a copy of the four holy texts of the Axiomatic General (The Four Planes of Certain Truth) plus one additional book of specific thoughts on the area of expertise of the congregation. These boxes are identical as adornment or elaboration is forbidden as an unnecessary distraction, and are always at the centre of any service of worship or decision-making process. Whenever the box is locked after its final use for the day, the text within each book is updated via divine intervention if a more accurate and truthful version of any piece of information has been discovered and when new facts have been uncovered.</p>\n<p>Each place of worship also contains the thought processes of anyone who has worked to uncover indisputable truths, as well as the evidence that demonstrates that truth. Whenever someone is uncovering a new truth, their work-in-progress materials are stored here as well.</p>\n<h2>Holy Texts</h2>\n<p>The Four Planes of Certain Truth contain the pertinent and unequivocal statements confirmed by the Axiomatic General. When stored in their magical box they are updated via divine intervention when it is locked at the end of the day. No decision is made without this box being present, even if it isn’t used. Clerics of the Overseer of War receive notification of changes as part of their meditation; all clerics and service leaders are encouraged to learn the texts by heart (as interpretation isn’t required).</p>\n<p>Each book bears a simple cover, binding, and little decoration other than an iron rod over a stylized letter that identifies its contents. Other documents stored at temples and shrines have these two symbols plus the initials of the author and the date of publication. When any document is superseded, the date of its relegation from cannon is stamped on the cover and the original symbols are scored through.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h3><em><strong>Axioms of War</strong></em></h3>\n<p>This contains the latest approved plans for war as a whole, as well as tactics for individual fights. The core content—when consulted prior to a battle—confers both a confidence-boosting and calming effect as it confirms how its actions bring eventual victory in the war (with that day’s battle an important part of it). Chapters detail the stages of engagement and explain the surest way forward at each point. They describe how a lawful plan can be overcome by the sheer weight of chaos, but also how to learn from that experience and counter it in the next battle.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<h3><em><strong>Axioms of Law</strong></em></h3>\n<p>This contains the latest approved plans for passing legal judgment as a whole, as well as tactics for individual cases. When consulted prior to establishing guilt or innocence, it confers both a clarity- and authority-boosting effect as it confirms how its actions ensure the correct judgment is reached. Chapters detail the stages of ascertaining the truth from all that has been presented as evidence as well as methods to consider it in an effective, efficient, and impartial manner. They also describe how well-made laws can be twisted and broken by the inherently devious, and how to rewrite those laws to ensure this doesn’t happen in future.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<h3><em><strong>Axioms of Decisions</strong></em></h3>\n<p>This contains the latest methods and directions for effective and efficient meditation as well as long-established research techniques from the church’s greatest sages and experts. When consulted before an investigation is started, it confers a mind-clearing and attention-focusing effect as it confirms how its actions allow a user to reveal the most pertinent and accurate information. Chapters detail how to consider what needs to be discovered, how to ensure what is found matches the initial requirements, and then how to use the information to make the correct decision. They also describe how distraction, obfuscation, and distortion of aims and objects (such as shortcuts) lead to an incorrect decision with long-term consequences.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<h3><em><strong>Axioms of Enlightenment</strong></em></h3>\n<p>This contains pathways to understanding the world at large and the part one plays in that world as well as how the best of life is achieved through the order. When consulted before meditating, it confers an open-mindedness that ensures the route to enlightenment is properly followed as it confirms how its actions allow a user to reach self-knowledge without deviation or distraction. Chapters give details on what to do before, during, and after meditation, as well as how to realize enlightenment has been reached. They also describe how our contemplation can be lessened by the actions of others, but how these digressions can be overcome and enlightenment eventually reached.</p>\n<h2>Holidays</h2>\n<p>The Axiomatic General is not celebrated at any specific festivals. Instead, when the law prevails during any of the god’s areas of interest, followers offer a prayer of thanks no more than 30 minutes after the event. If gratitude is shown later than this, it probably means the follower was distracted from the task at hand and has acted in a chaotic way to make the thanks fit in. Better to acknowledge the effect of the Overseer of War with one’s body and mind than take yourself away from a pressing matter and make two situations chaotic.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n</div>","markdown":""},"_id":"OB8fp8gIre5yoZax","image":{},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"sort":400000,"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"JournalEntry.0FSVjV3WkdoAk7OX.JournalEntryPage.K8IEnGHHZ3800Nio"}}},{"name":"Ancestor Spirit","type":"text","title":{"show":false,"level":1},"text":{"format":1,"content":"<div class=\"aventyr\">\n<p class=\"s5\">Ancestor Spirit</p>\n<img style=\"margin:0px 10px 10px 0px;border:0px;float:right\" src=\"modules/aaw-games-aventyr/Deities-Images/waterfall_edit-scaled.webp\" width=\"244\" height=\"698\" />\n<p><strong>Titles: </strong>Breath of Life, Life Spirit</p>\n<p><strong>Home: </strong>Positive energy plane</p>\n<p><strong>Alignment: </strong>NG</p>\n<p><strong>Portfolio: </strong>Ancestor, nature, wilderness, wisdom</p>\n<p><strong>Worshippers:</strong> @UUID[JournalEntry.QlctNkzE9injOde9.JournalEntryPage.I4CpK8rTs0HgD7hW]{Vikmordere}</p>\n<p><strong>Domains: </strong>Animal, Community, Plant</p>\n<p><strong>Subdomains: </strong>Ancestors, Seasons, Souls</p>\n<p><strong>Favored Weapon: </strong>Wooden staff</p>\n<p>The Ancestor Spirit venerates reconnection with nature, and exploration of one’s inner being without the scourge of individual financial gain.</p>\n<p>    The pure energy which forms this deity is comprised of the souls of the original ancient settlers of the @UUID[JournalEntry.QVrlu0lTv2vFtT5P]{Klavek Kingdom}/@UUID[JournalEntry.Cg0Nt8mDPQ7JrmyB]{Vikmordere}.

He was dissatisfied; dwarves had become a lesser race, overcome by the @UUID[JournalEntry.QlctNkzE9injOde9.JournalEntryPage.8HyVcZ70eyhwNJsu]{Drow}, among others. His life was punctuated by constant struggle and heroic feats that are the things of legend: he re-mastered the lost arts of metalworking once known by his ancestors; he defended his homeland single-handedly against creatures of the Underworld, and he built himself a flawless suit of unbreakable armour. Inside this shell, he was an unstoppable force, and Balir took back thousands of miles of once-dwarven lands. He rose higher than any before making the fatal flaw of offering his hand in peace to the drow.</p>\n<p>The story goes that the Drow cast a curse of burning into his unbreakable armour, sealing the dwarf inside and setting it ablaze forever. But at this moment the gods saw Balir as the greatest martyr of his people and granted him a spark of divinity; he awoke as a god, still within the armour that had become his tomb, and departed the mortal realm.</p>\n<p>Having risen from the ranks of mortals, Balir has been forced to prove himself to the gods over and over again, showing them he is worthy. His feats as a god are no less than his feats as a mortal, although they take place in realms far beyond man’s comprehension. It is from one of these divine toils that he claimed his mighty hammer, Soul Forger – a weapon clearly claimed from a creature many times larger than Balir himself.</p>\n<p>Even as he found himself a god, Balir kept his destroyed mortal form as a sign of his penance. Instead of divine flesh, he constructed a metal body for himself to replace the one he lost. This new skin is without the flaw of mercy that destroyed him as a mortal. And although Balir’s scarred face is unmistakably dwarven, his body is anything but. A cast of white mithral and black iron, he appears more machine than man. Now, even with his drow-cursed armour destroyed, he still blazes with the murderous fire; in his chest, he carries a spark from which the sun was born. When he does not appear in his divine form, Balir assumes the guise of a young dwarf, typically bearing scars on his face and arms from flame.</p>\n<h2>Churches, Clergy, and Worshippers</h2>\n<p>Churches to Balir are at once humble and magnificent. Their areas of worship are simple and unadorned, although always practical, in a manner befitting dwarven life itself. Whether the smallest shrine or grandest cathedral, sites dedicated to Balir always stand near a place of work, toil, and creation. In them, they are guided by Balir’s ancient knowledge and secrets to produce machines, mechanical goods, and works of active art unlike anywhere else in the world. Balir’s clergy are predominantly dwarven, although some humans do acclaim his faith as well. Where they can, they dress in mithral and crimson – styling themselves after their god. Poorer members of the faith dress instead in white and yellow. Worshippers almost always offer constructed items as their offering. If they do resort to just money, it’s always directed toward a newly-qualified crafter or a promising apprentice.</p>\n<h2>Holy Text</h2>\n<p>The Life of Balir is unlike any standard book of holy teachings. Instead, this tome is almost three thousand pages long and details the thousand trials and tribulations of Balir’s life, written in such a way that it is more like a dwarven self-help book than divine instruction. Some versions have additional volumes discussing the merits of each action Balir took, although these are known to be opinions, not facts. The original text is unchanged from when it was penned by Balir’s own son, after the dwarf’s ascension to godhood.</p>\n</div>","markdown":""},"_id":"SjKuUjzrx9TNLn0y","image":{},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"sort":500000,"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"JournalEntry.EykWA9hRZOjLFz6G.JournalEntryPage.JtgEqWY5XOkGnzgZ"}}},{"name":"The Current","type":"text","title":{"show":false,"level":1},"text":{"format":1,"content":"<div class=\"aventyr\">\n<p class=\"s5\">The Current</p>\n<img style=\"float:right;margin:0px 10px 10px 0px;border:0px\" src=\"modules/aaw-games-aventyr/Deities-Images/The-Current.webp\" width=\"267\" height=\"316\" />\n<p><strong>Alignment:</strong> LN</p>\n<p><strong>Portfolio:</strong> Insanity, Mysticism, Seas, Underworld Waters, the Unknown</p>\n<p><strong>Domains:</strong> Madness (Nightmare), Magic (Arcane), Void (Dark Tapestry), Water (Oceans)</p>\n<p><strong>Favoured Weapon:</strong> Tentacle (whips, spiked chains)</p>\n<p><strong>Favored Animals:</strong> Octopus, Squid</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>History</h2>\n<p>The other deities of Aventyr are forever vigilant for even the slightest brush of the Current’s tentacles in their plans or near their essence, keeping a respectful distance from the maddening god. Its motives are totally unpredictable, though it strikes swiftly and without warning when it is suited to do so. The affairs of the gods don’t seem to bear any interest to the Current, however, and it is thought to be slumbering, like the massive beasts that lay in the ruins of the vestraadi’s ancient civilizations. Indeed, some believe that these enormous predators are somehow related to the maddening god and not without good reason; they appeared not long after the Current came to Aventyr.</p>\n<h2>Appearance</h2>\n<p>Records of The Current’s appearance are extremely vague by necessity; those that look upon it are driven utterly mad. The few reliable accounts claim that it is floating, slithering or pulsating mass of writhing tentacles, the end of each covered in barbs of colours for which there is no shade or name.</p>\n<h2>Churches of the Maddening God</h2>\n<p>These revered houses of worship completely encompass those within them, covered in sculptures of tentacles that extend throughout the structure. The holiest of these churches are actually made from the recovered limbs of enormous squids and octopuses—the architecture within them drives any non-followers of the Current to madness, afflicting any creature within with a form of insanity should they fail a DC 16 Wisdom saving throw.</p>\n<h2>Holy Text</h2>\n<p>No books exist for the religion of the maddening god; instead, the vestraadi keep song strings. When wound or unwound underwater, these magical cords play hymns of the Current’s religion (in a tongue those that hear them can understand). The holiest and most valuable of these song strings are said to relate the true origins of the aquatic deity but are said to drive those that hear them mad with the voice of the Current, cursed to forever live with its echo in their mind.</p>\n<h2>Vast Swamp</h2>\n<p>@UUID[JournalEntry.g4odaMsHbRkeNFhn.JournalEntryPage.oIbJsrbNZu7GVWp9#the-muddy-mangroves]{The Muddy Mangroves} has always been the center of the Current’s clergy in the Vast Swamp.

Her mother, Laelstra, was the Matron’s personal seeress. Hivaka possessed only the slightest of her mother’s magical abilities, mastering cantrips at an early age, but progressing no further. Being the youngest daughter, barely older than her only brother, and her sisters already being groomed for succession to various positions within the House, Hivaka found herself being used as leverage but almost everyone around her.</p>\n<p>    Hivaka’s father, Elkerd, was first son of House Kilduis, allies of House Ruim. Among Elkerd’s vices was gambling—he never minded losing, as long as fun was had by all. The problems began when he started using House Kildius’ assets to cover his wagers. When he was financially cut off from House Kilduis, he took the step of offering his youngest daughter, Hivaka, to the winner of a game of orbben. When Elkerd lost to Imfein of House Rilyntyl, a rival of House Kilduis, Hivaka was taken from her home by force. Laelstra protested, but there were too many reliable witnesses to the wager for her challenges to hold sway over her Matron. Thus, Hivaka was taken into slavery by House Rilyntyl. Laelstra attempted to buy Hivaka from Imfein, but was rebuffed, as having a bargaining chip against House Kilduis’ ally was worth much more than gold.</p>\n<p>     Aside from the hard labour she and many others were forced to endure, Hivaka was treated well—as well as a slave could be treated, anyway. She took her enforced servitude in stride, seeing as how she had almost never held any power of significance in her life. However, she harboured a hatred for her father, not understanding how a parent could blithely hand over their child’s life to another simply to cover a bet.</p>\n<p>     The guards from House Imfein did not treat her any better or any worse than any of the other slaves. Neither did they prohibit her mother from visiting her occasionally during the evening, as long as no escape attempts were made. They did, however, restrain her from braining her father with her work hammer the one and only time he approached her during a shift of breaking up rocks. If not for the guards, Elkerd would have died violently, but possibly not quickly.</p>\n<p>     Hivaka was a slave of House Imfein for almost a full year before Laelstra recruited a large following and put a plan into action that would free Hivak: she and her cohort would attack the Imfein guards at the slave pens during the night and Hivak would escape in the confusion while wearing the battle-dress of a House Imfein sorceress.</p>\n<p>      The assault appeared to be a success as chaos reigned in the slave pens, however, Laelstra had not anticipated two things: first, there were more guards than anticipated, causing longer holdups and more casualties as the attacking mob progressed. More guards also meant that an alarm could be sounded, bringing reinforcements, which compounded the existing issues with the rescue.</p>\n<p>    The second issue was that Hivaka had determined that no matter where she was in drow society, she would be enslaved. Either to another house or within her own, where she would be used as a pawn in countless numbers of schemes by her Matron and her own family. As the youngest daughter, she held the lowest standing. Because of this, she was determined not to return to her home.</p>\n<p>    Once in possession of the Imfein battle dress, Hivaka pulled the attached hood over her head and began leading slaves away, using her implied authority, along with some well-placed and spectacular-looking cantrips, to move them without interference. She had nearly one hundred slaves with her when they left the Xdot border.</p>\n<p>   Leading them on through the night, Hivaka found a narrow cave entrance that led into a larger cavern inside. Using the last of her available magicks, Hivaka attempted to cover the mouth of the cave with an illusion showing solid rock. The image was far more effective than Hivak knew because she and her group had attracted the attention of @UUID[.2MMXPI4kINBOYNOP]{Leacim}, the only known male drow deity.</p>\n<p>     A trickster among the more serious drow goddesses, @UUID[.2MMXPI4kINBOYNOP]{Leacim} took this opportunity to thumb his nose at his sisters and to have fun, watching as the drow patrols searched the area over and over, never seeing past his illusions.</p>\n<p>     The rescued slaves began worshipping Hivaka as a saviour. She resisted their praise, saying that she was simply another slave, like them. Leacim—knowing that these slaves needed someone to look up to, invested a small amount of his power in Hivaka, raising her above the mortals, but not so high as the divine: he made her a demigoddess.</p>\n<p>     Those under her protection turned their new home into a town, called Nhlilolin, which has become a haven for the outcasts of the Underworld.</p>\n<h2>Appearance</h2>\n<p>Hivaka is short, for a drow, but heavily muscled from her time as a slave. Her light grey hair is kept short for a drow female, the ends reaching her jawline. Her eyes are blue, relatively rare in the Underworld, and if you look into them, you will find nothing but steely resolve.</p>\n<p>   Hivaka keeps her clothes simple, preferring pants and shirts that have pockets. The more pockets, the better. She is never anywhere without the hammer that she used to break the chains of the other slaves before leading them off into the night. Every morning or after any combat, she repairs the wooden handle with the mending cantrip.</p>\n<h2>Church of Hivaka</h2>\n<p>Hivaka, as a very recent demigoddess, does not have a church, but those that were rescued from imprisonment literally sing her praises every day. She downplays her role as a saviour or someone to be worshipped. She does have her devoted followers and, thanks to @UUID[.2MMXPI4kINBOYNOP]{Leacim}, she is able to grant them a small number of spells. She has not gained any paladins, though.</p>\n<h2>Worshippers and Clergy</h2>\n<p>Those who escaped with Hivaka are her greatest worshippers, but any who have escaped bondage freely speak her name with reverence. There is no set clergy in Nhilolin, but some apostles go out into the Underworld (and a few to the Upperworld) and speak against slavery, striving to free those that are held down, if only through word if not deed.</p>\n<p>     Some of these preachers will gather the like-minded with them and attempt to free those taken by slavers. These zealots do not care if they live or die, as long as those imprisoned go free.</p>\n<h2>Holy Text</h2>\n<p>The Journey: The only text that Hivaka doesn’t simply shake her head at is The Journey. This collection of parchments is the story of not only Hivaka leading the slaves of House Imfein to freedom, but every person who has escaped from an overlord is welcome to add their story to The Journey. So far, almost three hundred stories have been put into the collection.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>A second “holy text” has begun circulating throughout Nhilolin and the Underworld, speaking of Hivaka in the holiest of languages, greatly exaggerating her abilities, and almost, but not quite, painting her as the goddess who will eventually overthrow the mightiest of slavers, Naraneus herself. Hivaka has tried to explain that the book, The Light of Hivaka and the Way Forward, brings attention to her and the town, which is mentioned by name in the book, and could lead to them all being recaptured.

Little is known to her followers of her true origins, only that she has proven to be an active and loyal spiritual force within the lives of those who never looked away from the older forms of worship.</p>\n<p>   Ja Qua exists within a sub-dimension connected to the mainlands of the Seelie Court and has fostered a deep relationship with the fey of her lands, looking upon them with the same love and care as her human followers. In turn, the fey has come to view her as one of their own and a revered person of power amongst their courts, and will not hesitate to interact on her behalf within her lands.</p>\n<h2>Appearance</h2>\n<p>Ja Qua appears in one of two forms when she chooses to appear at all. The first is that of a monstrously large and physically powerful jaguar, golden tawny in colour with spots that appear to shift and move before one’s eyes. Crowned with a rim of bony protrusions across her brow and snout, there is no mistaking Ja Qua in her feline form as the self-appointed Queen of her lands. Her second form is one of far more subtlety, one of an attractive woman, typically still keeping the tawny colour of her pelt within her long hair. The colour of her eyes in human form is said to be indescribable, as no true colour exists within nature to compare them to, and her voice will both seduce and petrify you with fear in the same instant.</p>\n<h2>Church of Ja Qua</h2>\n<p>Ja Qua’s worship is strongest within the lands of @UUID[JournalEntry.RMK7HBFDlPXDiURg]{NaeraCull}, though there is the random shrine amongst a few forgotten uncivilized locations, where the march of progress has not severed all of humanity's connection to the Seelie Court yet.</p>\n<h2>Worshippers and Clergy</h2>\n<p>Those tribal warriors deemed worthy are put through a ritualistic challenge to earn Ja Qua’s Blessing, the gift of lycanthropy. Those who survive the process of transformation, and are not driven mad by the ritualistic pain they must go through to prove their worth find themselves in a position of honour amongst the tribes and temples, utilized as guardians and hunters, protecting both the faith and an ancient way of life. Dressed in only a loincloth these warriors tend to embrace the custom of adorning themselves with colourful trinkets and baubles to mark victories over adversaries, or glorious hunts.</p>\n<p>    Those of great enough faith, but not physical stamina to serve the tribes as warriors tend the temples and altars of Ja Qua as her loyal clerics. Over time those of the deepest devotion begin to acquire certain feline traits, though they never achieve the full embrace of Ja Qua as the temple warriors do.</p>\n<h2>Holy Text</h2>\n<p>Scattered throughout the jungle are many lost ruins of forgotten tribes, within which are wall carvings and bas-reliefs depicting the teachings of various points in the history of the church of Ja Qua. Most of the written language of the people of NairaCull is pictographic and has never been compiled into text or bound format, although it is rumoured that a man travels the jungle seeking to do just that.</p>\n<h2>The Dralman Documents</h2>\n<p>A skald of some renown, Theo Dralman was quested by the Grand University of @UUID[JournalEntry.QVrlu0lTv2vFtT5P.JournalEntryPage.dwAJ5Jtc6ii8zQoh]{Mohkba} to enter the dark jungle and learn all he could of the spirits to which the native people prayed, and how the @UUID[JournalEntry.QVrlu0lTv2vFtT5P]{Klavek Kingdom} could use this information to its own end. That was many years ago, and many of the legends spoken amongst the tribes that have encountered Dralman would lead one to believe that his goals have changed, and his search for knowledge has become something far more personal. Most of the legends speak of a man carrying a great many scars, as if he had been mauled to the edge of death, only to be spared and shown a new path. There exist a few rare copies of his incomplete work, taken to the coastal towns by couriers and those on safari…the Dralman Documents they have become known as. All public possession of these documents within the borders of Klavekian-controlled lands is considered treasonous and punishable by seizure of properties and goods, as well as incarceration.</p>\n<p> </p>\n</div>","markdown":""},"_id":"21VmQoL4MPe6mX6q","image":{},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"sort":1100000,"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"JournalEntry.LQT16PQtjrxETCAe.JournalEntryPage.3JNs1m50QSpNDrdf"}}},{"name":"Leacim","type":"text","title":{"show":false,"level":1},"text":{"format":1,"content":"<div class=\"aventyr\">\n<p class=\"s5\">Leacim</p>\n<img style=\"float:right;margin:0px 10px 10px 0px;border:0px\" src=\"modules/aaw-games-aventyr/Deities-Images/Leacim.webp\" width=\"262\" height=\"371\" />\n<p><strong>Titles: </strong>The Clever Shadow</p>\n<p><strong>Symbol: </strong>Spinning 8-faceted gem</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary)\"><strong style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">Alignment: </strong>CN</span></p>\n<p><strong>Portfolio: </strong>Chance, Guile, Illusion, Misfortune, Self-Determination, Thieves</p>\n<p><strong>Domains: </strong>Chaos, Entropy, Deception, Luck, Trickery</p>\n<p><strong>Favoured</strong> <strong>Weapon:</strong> Scimitar, Shortbow, Throwing Knife</p>\n<p><strong>Favoured Animals:</strong> Any beast with camouflage or mimicry (such as a chameleon, stick bug, etc)</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>History</h2>\n<p>The Aventyr god known as Leacim was once a forgotten deity, supplanted by the doings of the colloid aeons before it ever reached the Underworld. Once a treasured god of cunning and wisdom, he was left bereft in the void of the cosmos—when Leacim stared into the void, something from the far beyond stared back. Now slightly deranged and without an identity, the god capered throughout the universe with a will and desire at the whim of his growing insanity.</p>\n<p>   Eventually, the divine energies wrought on Aventyr during the Forging of the Dvergr caught Leacim’s attention, drawing him to the periphery of the world to witness the rise of the progenitors and their fall into the draaki. It was the elven deities, however, that most interested the god of misfortune—over hundreds of years, he subtly infiltrated their pantheon and species, attributing fanatical devotees in the very flesh before spreading them across both Upper- and Underworld. He appeared inexplicably among the elven pantheon, fully adopting the drow form and gathering followers both before and after their exodus from Edhellond.</p>\n<p>     The most famous of these followers is @UUID[.fGrUoxdeUcElXl1w]{Hivaka} , the Savior of the Masses. Leacim took notice when she and her fellow slaves took flight from Xdot. He imparted the aspiring dark elf with some of his divine essences, forever transforming her into a demigoddess.</p>\n<p>   Leacim continues to take an active (albeit underhanded) role in the continued existence of the drow. He travels through the Underworld, briefly touching the souls of dark elves and morphing their alignments towards chaos, neutrality or even goodness if it suits his mood. The lone raider D’thul, a cannibalistic sorcerer-barbarian in the Fungi Forest near Holoth, is one such drow. Those on the surface often see their lives subtly influenced by the trickster god, and Leacim leads them to roles of dubious natures and unexpected rewards.</p>\n<h2>Special</h2>\n<p>Leacim takes delight in angering the other @UUID[JournalEntry.QlctNkzE9injOde9.JournalEntryPage.8HyVcZ70eyhwNJsu]{Drow} gods at every opportunity; his followers may substitute Leacim as the required diety for any item, class, feat or spell that has a drow deity requirement and may select the Drow domain if they have access to domains. Moreover, he often creates his own agents of change—players that wish to play a drow of good alignment in a place that would otherwise prohibit that choice may choose Leacim as their deity to avoid that caveat.</p>\n<h2>Appearance</h2>\n<p>The trickster god has numerous guises but he most commonly appears as an affably dressed male half-drow with an alluring grin or a blonde human girl, regardless of form, both have piercing blue eyes. Leacim’s clothing is generally fashionable and appropriate for the environment, though it is sometimes slightly tattered and seemingly in a state of disrepair. He casually saunters seemingly without a care in the world, a scimitar on his side and a black-lacquered short bow across his back, in the female form he carries only a single knife as a weapon which always returns to him when thrown.</p>\n<h2>Shrines to the Trickster</h2>\n<p>Leacim doesn’t have proper churches—effigies and the like are hidden in plain sight or are places of secret pilgrimage. These shrines are often made to look like they belong to other deities, and only show their true forms when the correct prayers are uttered. Followers that fail a DC 28 Knowledge (religion) check find their god distempered with them after praying at one of these shrines, though they remain unsure as to why (regardless of any divination spells they cast).</p>\n<h2>Holy Text</h2>\n<p>Leacim’s Lexicon is a treasured tome among thieves’ guilds, hidden drow enclaves and the trickster god’s followers. These books appear as unremarkable journals of unremarkable lives to followers of other deities (DC 26 Wisdom saving throw to negate) but in the hands of a devoted acolyte, provide a means to learn any rogue trick, illusion spell, or access to knowledge of prestige classes that require sneak attack as a prerequisite.</p>\n<h2>The Vast Swamp</h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:Signika, sans-serif\">Leahcim has taken root in the @UUID[JournalEntry.g4odaMsHbRkeNFhn]{Vast Swamp}, his trickster ways helping some daredevil rogues on their quest to lessen the burden of treasure on the vile dragons. It must be added that the tales of the rogues have become known but so far none have surfaced to verify these claims. Recently some inhabitants in the marshes have voiced their concerns—that these rumors are merely planted by Leahcim himself for some unknown reason—but the trickster god has plans and schemes no mere mortal can hope to discern.</span></p>\n</div>","markdown":""},"_id":"2MMXPI4kINBOYNOP","image":{},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"sort":1200000,"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"JournalEntry.fAaBvRaalStVHLAa.JournalEntryPage.CYEQQN8Bs7oSr3YE"}}},{"name":"Musta’Vohi","type":"text","title":{"show":false,"level":1},"text":{"format":1,"content":"<div class=\"aventyr\"><p class=\"s5\">Musta’Vohi</p><p><strong>Titles: </strong>God Mother, Heavenly Concubine</p><p><strong>Homel: </strong>Everywhere</p><p><strong>Symbol: </strong>A goat’s head painted black</p><p><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary)\"><strong style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">Alignment: </strong>NE</span></p><p><strong>Portfolio: </strong>Birth, Health, Motherhood, Lust, Pregnancy</p><p><strong>Domains: </strong>Charm, Darkness, Healing, Protection</p><p><strong>Favoured</strong> <strong>Weapon:</strong> Spiked chain</p><p> </p><h2>History</h2><p>According to the @UUID[JournalEntry.dHHrcptCELfN05gb.JournalEntryPage.Tc1kTiX3bvQt4Jd7]{Yerek}, Musta’Vohi created the universe from the sheer will to reproduce.

This light both warmed the cosmos and struck out against the darkness that also appeared. This light, both protective and aggressive is embodied in Naneth. She is both Leaf Mother and Warrior Mother.</p>\n<p>   Naneth (NAH neth), her sister @UUID[.leuKpASroHy7r6sn]{Naraneus}, and their brother @UUID[.zNH5DtHDKD52Ufaf]{Onael} created the first elves. Naneth comforted and warmed the elves, but she also taught them to defend themselves. She showed them to care for each other and themselves, but they only had each other to rely on. As the elves evolved, she became more of a mothering figure to them, offsetting the chaotic presence of Naraneus, while Onael drifted away from the family.</p>\n<p>    Eventually, Naraneus became jealous of Naneth’s mothering ways and began a feud between the two that would last for ages and eventually encompass the elves as well, two groups choosing a deity to follow. Naraneus lost and the elves that followed her were banished from Edhellond.</p>\n<p>    Once the war was over, Naneth reflected on Naraneus’s deceit. She decided that if she could not trust her own sister, her children couldn’t trust anyone else. She instructed the Matriarch to retreat completely within @UUID[JournalEntry.wVQiwLZtRuaqbpFA]{Edhellond, the Silent Forest}.</p>\n<p>    Trade relations with the other races suddenly ceased and there was no response from envoys sent to the elves. The entire elven society retreated into Edhellond, turning entirely to hunting, agriculture, and magic; forsaking any trade or relations with other races.</p>\n<p>   Naneth taught the elves that they were to rely only on themselves for everything. There would be no trade, no exchanges of information, no envoys allowed inside Edhellond and only those on secret missions benefiting elvish society were allowed to venture out from Edhellond.</p>\n<h2>Appearance</h2>\n<p>Naneth appears in two forms, befitting her dual nature. In her Asaya Naneth (Leaf Mother) form, she appears as a motherly female Elf, with long golden hair that reaches the ground and she always carries a basket of bright blue flowers. In her Maethor Naneth (Warrior Mother) guise, she appears as a tall, stout elf, dressed in leather armour and a small cap keeping her jet black hair out of the way. Regardless of how she dresses, she has a pin of her symbol at the neck of her garment. She always carries a shield that is designed to look like her symbol.</p>\n<p>    She can change between the two forms in the blink of an eye.</p>\n<h2>Church of Naneth</h2>\n<p>Naneth’s “church” is more of an outdoor shrine at the largest maple tree in the Silent Forest, Tal. Edhellond is a theocracy, led by the current Matriarch or Patriarch, who also leads the services to Naneth.</p>\n<h2>Worshippers and Clergy</h2>\n<p>All surface elves worship Naneth in either of her two forms and worship of both is the norm. Clergy outside of the Matriarch/Patriarch and the Cleric of Naneth selected by the ruler are treated equally regardless of power level or ability. The motto of the clergy is “We only have ourselves” so they do not discriminate in any way.</p>\n<h2>Holy Text</h2>\n<p>The Triploid Text: This tome is separated into sections of three, with each section beginning with a parable of Asaya Naneth, ending with a parable of Maethon Naneth, and the middle section being descriptions of the war between the elves and between Naneth and @UUID[.leuKpASroHy7r6sn]{Naraneus}.</p>\n<p>The cover of the copy that belongs to the Matriarch or Patriarch is created from several massive maple leaves.

Others claim it is the essence of the Honningsop Mushroom, the oldest living thing on the planet, elevated to godhood from the residual divine energies wrought throughout history. Its awakening may not have been caused by the pantheon’s doings, but its emergence seems to coincide with The Grand Sculpting and the Great Schism.</p>\n<p>As the endless caves of the Underworld expanded, vast chambers filled with moisture risen from tunnels hundreds of miles away, creating damp caverns of moist earth. The Natural Force seeded the subterranean breezes with its spores, creating the mushroom jungles and fungal forests of Aventyr. More than that, some of these spores carried the very children of the deity—intelligent, benevolent plant humanoids known as @UUID[JournalEntry.QlctNkzE9injOde9.JournalEntryPage.yv3q3b1HnUnZB2OT]{Funglet}.</p>\n<p>The divine beings of Aventyr generally regard the great nature deity of the Underworld with a measure of respect, if they acknowledge it at all. It answers the calls of its followers but is remarkably slow to act openly, playing the great game of the gods with a level of detachment and planning that no other deity can fathom.</p>\n<h2>Appearance</h2>\n<p>When the Natural Force does appear (which is extremely rare), it does so as a @UUID[JournalEntry.QlctNkzE9injOde9.JournalEntryPage.yv3q3b1HnUnZB2OT]{Funglet} of enormous height, colored in a kaleidoscopic mixture of all the different subtypes and carrying a gigantic club made from a fantafungi. Every patch of earth the Natural Force touches erupts with a random assortment of mushrooms immediately after he breaks contact with it, and all naturally grown barriers part their way for it and take no damage from its passing.</p>\n<h2>Church of the Natural Force</h2>\n<p>Any monument or sculpture of a mushroom serves as a shrine to the Natural Force, though acolytes of the nature deity pray to fungus of large size or greater if they are able to. Sites of particular religious significance always bear an importance to the number three, though none are sure why (save the Natural Force and its wisest adherents, though they have never revealed it).</p>\n<h2>Holy Text</h2>\n<p>The Libre Boletus is a tome crafted from boletann pages. Anyone that casually skims the book sees nothing but simple gardening tips to encourage the growth of mushrooms, but should they read it fully through, the pages transform to explain the tenets of the Natural Force’s faith. Carefully absorbing the contents of the tome (requiring 24 hours of reading) teaches the reader the rituals necessary to work and craft boletann.</p>\n<h2>The Vast Swamp</h2>\n<p>The Natural Force is worshiped throughout the Vast Swamp by druids and shamans of the various tribes that inhabit the area. While this mysterious entity has always been worshipped on varying scales throughout history, recently there has been a surge in followers as an unexplained patch of mushrooms not native to the swamp recently flourished in the @UUID[JournalEntry.g4odaMsHbRkeNFhn.JournalEntryPage.oIbJsrbNZu7GVWp9#the-jagged-coast]{The Jagged Coast} area, inexplicably resisting all attempts by @UUID[JournalEntry.g4odaMsHbRkeNFhn.JournalEntryPage.JuqcYkrHQOMobwTy#dreivantix]{Dreivantix} to destroy it.

Together, they created the beings that would become knows at elves. @UUID[.oyFVdicDq8mbjOWw]{Naneth} provided the loving and mothering aspect. She showed them how to care for and protect each other, teaching them skills they needed to survive. @UUID[.leuKpASroHy7r6sn]{Naraneus} provided the chaos that seemed to pervade this new world and taught the elves about death and destruction and how to kill for food. Onael provided the controlling aspect, teaching the elves that in order to succeed, in spite of the chaos, there needed to be order and control. He taught them leadership and command and that of all the newly formed races, the elves were the greatest of them all.</p><p>    Eventually, over the millennia, the elves evolved away from the controlled savagery and into the form that is more common today. As the world became more ordered, they needed their aggression less and opened themselves up more to the life and magic that surrounded them. Without as much violence, they began to live longer and grew smaller, as their muscles were not needed as much for combat. They understood that they did not need to conquer and control to live in the modern world and accepted their place, arriving in @UUID[JournalEntry.wVQiwLZtRuaqbpFA]{Edhellond}, the Elven land that would become known as the Silent Forest.</p><p>   Onael did not understand. He thought he had taught them correctly. Seeing that the elves had turned their back on him, he took what he considered his “children,” the Edheliast, and retreated from the world to the Forgotten Forest, a demiplane that he considered his home.</p><p>    In the Forgotten Forest, the Edheliast continue to fight for survival, growing bigger, stronger, faster, and more cunning. They fight against animals, magical beasts, and even the souls of dead elves and drow that Onael claims before @UUID[.oyFVdicDq8mbjOWw]{Naneth} or @UUID[.leuKpASroHy7r6sn]{Naraneus} can.</p><p>    Recently, Onael has begun work to reclaim the elves as his own. He has many Edheliast to fight for him and he has created a new beast that will surely be a surprise to the elves.</p><h2>Appearance</h2><p>Onael appears as an Elf of immense size. He stands close to fifteen feet tall and is very heavily muscled. His dark hair is close cropped and shows off a widow’s peak. He is dressed conservatively, wearing only a black tunic with his symbol on the left breast, black pants, and black boots. On his left hip rest his longsword Coiasan.</p><p> Images of @UUID[.oyFVdicDq8mbjOWw]{Naneth}, @UUID[.leuKpASroHy7r6sn]{Naraneus}, and Onael show that there is a sibling similarity between the three, but Onael claims that he has no sisters.</p><h2>Church</h2><p>There is no church of Onael. There are no services or high priests, only combat. The Edheliant serve Onael by fighting and honing their skills.</p><h2>Worshippers and Clergy</h2><p>Every Edheliant worships Onael in trials by combat. The Edheliant dedicate every battle they participate in to Onael’s glory and ask for him to fill their bodies with power to crush their enemies.</p><p>   There is no church hierarchy. Those that Onael graces with the merest fraction of his power use the spells granted to them to enhance the combat abilities of their comrades and themselves. Onael’s clerics call themselves “Sword Arms” and mostly use spells that increase Strength or Constitution but will also make liberal use of Cure spells and Channeling Energy (if Neutral) to make sure they and their comrades can continue fighting.</p><h2>Holy Text</h2><p>None, although any manual that teaches someone a new fighting technique or improves on an existing technique are considered sacred and are kept in a “library” in the middle of the Forgotten Forest.</p><p> This library is really just many piles of books collected from different planes and realms and every book in the collection deals with some sort of combat.

In the time after the Sun Lord brought the warming of the land, Storjeger led numerous hunts into the forest where they killed many animals. In the bounty that was the land warming, they hadn’t realized that they had over-hunted, leaving the land unbalanced. This led to a lack of game when the land began to cool after the Sun Lord’s death.</p><p>      As the tribe began to dwindle due to lack of food in the harsh winter, Storjeger, as thin as the rest of the tribe, went into the forest alone to find what food he could. After several hours, he spotted a large stag with an impressive rack of horns. Sneaking as close as he dared, his hands trembling from hunger, he threw his javelin. It missed badly, but instead of rushing into the woods, the deer turned and looked at Storjeger.</p><p>    The stag turned and walked slowly into the woods with Storjeger close behind. Following the deer for another hour, Storjeger had been led him to a place in the woods he had never been before. In the distance, he saw a herd of deer that numbered in the dozens with many calves. He prepared his javelin, but the deer he had followed looked at him and then knelt down, laying down its head. It was joined by three does, each kneeling down and offering their necks to Storjeger.</p><p>    Storjeger drew his knife and offering thanks to the deer for their sacrifice, killed the four. He took a few small pieces of meat for himself to sustain him for the trip back. He produced a large sack and bundled the three deer into it and tied the bag to his belt. The stag, he hefted onto his shoulders as a sign of respect.</p><p>     He made the walk back to the Skykosh tribe with tears in his eyes as he knew he could provide for his people. On the trip back, Storjeger realized that his people had to live in balance with the animals of the forest in order to make sure this didn’t happen again. As it was partly his fault that the tribe was in such a predicament, Storjeger was determined to protect the balance of the forest.</p><p>     Upon returning to his tribe, he delivered the deer and explained what had happened and what he had seen and the understanding of the balance. He took the head of the stag and created a mask from it and made a coat from the skin. Without another word, Storjeger walked out of the village and into the realm of the gods, making the name Storjeger synonymous with survival and donning the mantle of God of the Hunt.</p><p>    Storjeger (STOR jay ger) almost always appears as a giant elk but sometimes manifests as a thin warrior of medium height with a stag’s head and horns. He carries several javelin on his back, a longbow made from Yggdrasil, and three arrows, each unique and powerful.</p><p>      Storjeger was originally worshipped only by the @UUID[JournalEntry.QlctNkzE9injOde9.JournalEntryPage.I4CpK8rTs0HgD7hW]{Vikmordere}, but in a very brief period before the @UUID[JournalEntry.QlctNkzE9injOde9.JournalEntryPage.DXD1ygEckY0JIUFB]{Klavekians} went to war with the Vikmordere, there was an exchange of information, including the tale of Storjeger.

More than a physical being, as the insectoids came to dominate the planet of the alien god’s origin, Zagnexis manifested as the congealed consciousness of their dead. While the other intelligent lifeforms on that world fought valiantly, with a deific being directing the racial hive mind of the @UUID[JournalEntry.QlctNkzE9injOde9.JournalEntryPage.SGw7zGFtvjLNPDMY]{hoyrall}, they quickly came to rule over all that the insect god could perceive.</p>\n<p> Until the Great Schism. The progenitors, cast down from their once mythic forms into the lowly race now known as the draaki, made a desperate cry to the cosmos and it was Zagnexis that answered their plea. Mustering the unimaginable power granted from the complete devotion of an entire race of creatures, the insect god transported his entire physical form into Aventyr—Zagn, along with tens of thousands of hoyrall—directly across the universe and into the Dracoprime’s skull, killing the draconic monstrosity instantly.</p>\n<p>    For some generations, Exis continued to direct its children on Aventyr, growing a massive army within the fortress-hives of the hoyrall in preparation for an all-out assault to conquer both the surface and the Underworld. Were it not for the intervention of the colloid during The Confluence, it surely would have succeeded. The other alien entity seized upon Exis conduit to its children, breaking the hive mind of the hoyrall and sending its physical counterpart, Zagn, careening into the oceans of Aventyr to wreck havoc upon everything it meets.</p>\n<p>    Since then, Exis has retained what connections it can to Aventyr, granting powers to its clerics and oracles but little more. The alien god wants nothing more than to expand and procreate, increasing its deific power by generating a second world of followers. Exis is avaricious and without regard for the general balance of natural powers; it will stop at nothing to re-establish its hold over both Zagn and the hoyrall before consuming all of Aventyr.</p>\n<h2>Appearance</h2>\n<p>Exis is a spectral insect composed of dozens of different arthropods, its countless limbs, heads, eyes and antennae constantly morphing into new shapes or variations. Zagn is an enormous, multi-headed (and multi-mouthed) segmented worm with thousands upon thousands of legs that span a body measured by miles.</p>\n<h2>Church of Zagnexis</h2>\n<p>Temples, churches and shrines devoted to the alien god are commonly found throughout the fortress-hives of the hoyrall and honeycombed into Upperworld mountains, but most are in terrible states of disrepair. The unrest following The Confluence led to the dissolution of hoyrall society, and the sites of worship to the god that once bound them all together were quickly targeted by dissenters and never-do-wells. New churches to Zagnexis are well-appointed and carefully kept, tiled with the carapace of insects in exquisite mosaics that depict the journey of the hoyrall.</p>\n<h2>Holy Text</h2>\n<p>There is no written or oral tradition to the worship of Zagnexis; lesser followers are taught the rites of worship through nonverbal communication (through limbs or antennae), and acolytes meld their minds with greater priests in ritual-driven meldings of the minds. Only this devout form of communication is fit for the transmission of the holiest information known to the worshippers of the insect god.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n</div>","markdown":""},"_id":"BgaAYMVXk3L6daU4","image":{},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"sort":2200000,"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"JournalEntry.1nhWSRlTjP4u99gB.JournalEntryPage.vHtchpvGcDlwG7Ja"}}},{"sort":2150000,"name":"Xio","type":"text","_id":"o7Bl7XnxenERvjAq","title":{"show":false,"level":1},"image":{},"text":{"format":1,"content":"<div class=\"aventyr\"><p class=\"s5\">Xio</p><p><strong>Titles:</strong> The Eternal Combatant, Captain of Captains, The Blood Rage</p><p><strong>Home:</strong> Valhalla</p><p><strong>Symbol:</strong> A star crafted from five crossed swords surrounding a bleached skull</p><p><strong>Alignment:</strong> NE</p><p><strong>Portfolio:</strong> Bravery, Combat, War</p><p><strong>Domains:</strong> Destruction, Ferocity, Honor, Strength, War</p><p><strong>Favored Weapon:</strong> Warhammer and handaxe</p><p>Xio is the deity of battle, both honorable and otherwise; he goes wherever there is war or brings it to lands where it is not, ensuring constant and glorious battle.</p><h2>History</h2><p>None truly know when Xio came into existence, but it is said that as long as there has been conflict, he has been amongst those who fight.

Xio’s true form is unknown, as whenever a mortal sees him he appears as a battle-scarred member of the same race and gender as the observer (though most at least agree that Xio is a male deity).

She wears a homespun brown robe woven with simple leaf patterns. Her hair is that of autumn leaves, tinged with flame.

Clerics of the Great Mother must select the community domain (or family subdomain) as one of their domains, but may select any of the elemental domains or subdomains as their second. The prestige class, devotee of the Four Hearts, grants access to additional elemental domains.</p><p>Clerics with the separatist archetype can often be found. The Great Mother recognizes that there are many paths to community, and loves these “Fallen Leaves” as much as any other worshipper, hoping they will one day embrace community as a tenet of faith.</p><h3>Fallen Leaf cleric</h3><p>Fallen Leaves are clerics of the Mother Spirit Mastering the divine nature of dual elements requires further study, available only to the Devotee of the Four Hearts.</p><h3>Devotee of the Four Hearts</h3><p>Devotees of the Four Hearts are worshipers of the Mother Spirit who seek to understand more fully the act of creation initiated by the joining of all four of the elements through a deeper examination of the elements themselves. As their understanding increases, they add additional domains to their repertoire of gifts from the goddess.</p><p><strong>Role:</strong> A Devotee of the Four Hearts is more prepared to deal with elemental challenges than her less erudite brothers and sisters. Because the theological study of the elements is deeply intertwined with the nature of the goddess, the scaling of the holy abilities of these priests are less impacted with a diversion into a prestige class.</p><p><strong>Alignment:</strong> Most members of this prestige class tend to be neutral or neutral good to better understand the balance required in bringing together the elements. Lawful clerics embrace the discipline of safeguarding the elements and the world around them while those elements join in community, whereas chaotic priests embrace the messiness of creation.</p><h2>Holy Text: The Tree of Community</h2><p>Temples to the goddess are centered around a great tree which forms the center of the complex, regardless of its architectural style (or design of the grove in cases of a fey temple). The leaves of the tree contain the holy writings of the Mother, as well as the stories of her worshippers, unnumbered as the leaves themselves. Divination and prophetic magic is often tied to, or enhanced by, the tree of community; to read one’s leaf is to gain insight to one’s soul.</p><p></p><p></p></div>","markdown":""},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}},{"sort":1950000,"name":"Qathindli","type":"text","_id":"jjNtg5QMfe2uI6uS","title":{"show":false,"level":1},"image":{},"text":{"format":1,"content":"<div class=\"aventyr\"><p class=\"s5\">Qathindli</p><p><strong>Titles:</strong> The Monkey Primeval, The Unsullied</p><p><strong>Home:</strong> @UUID[JournalEntry.dHHrcptCELfN05gb.JournalEntryPage.eOVkEXkbiSWbkVcp#treeland]{Treeland}</p><p><strong>Alignment:</strong> Chaotic Neutral</p><p><strong>Symbol:</strong> A monkey face with a painted boomerang for a smiling mouth (only used by humans)</p><p><strong>Portfolio:</strong> Nature, Primates, Wilderness</p><p><strong>Worshippers:</strong> Monkeys and disparate or relocated people from the @UUID[JournalEntry.g4odaMsHbRkeNFhn]{Vast Swamp} or the @UUID[JournalEntry.dHHrcptCELfN05gb]{Yerek Steppes}</p><p><strong>Domains:</strong> Animal, Chaos, Plant, Protection</p><p><strong>Favored Weapon:</strong> Boomerang</p><p></p><p>Two hundred years ago, Mentane Flamebearer, a human cleric of a best-forgotten god, and Golar, his half-orc monk bodyguard landed on the eastern shore of what would become @UUID[JournalEntry.dHHrcptCELfN05gb.JournalEntryPage.eOVkEXkbiSWbkVcp#treeland]{Treeland}. The reason for the visit was that Mentane thought he had found a way to become a god. His hypothesis was that if he could instill the magical essences that he acquired daily into the same place for a long period of time, then the release of that pent up energy into himself would push him past the boundary of mortality and into the realm of godhood. Mentane chose a small fuzzy fruit with a green interior, called a forhoral, which grew on a vine as his receptacle of power.</p><p>As they settled on the eastern edge of the forest Golar began to notice the large numbers of primates in the forest.

Some of the primates took interest in the two for a while, but seeing that they were no immediate threat, they were content to ignore the two.</p><p>After about a month, one small chimpanzee began following the Golar as he explored what would become known as Treeland. He began to call her “Qathindli,” which translated roughly to “small one” in his local Orcish dialect. He would call and wave to her every morning and she would chatter back at him.</p><p>Something surprising that Golar noticed was that Qathindli would watch him when he went through his morning exercises. She would sit on a branch and stare at him while he moved in slow, deliberate patterns. She had taken a special liking to his three-bladed boomerang. When she wasn’t watching him practice, he would almost always find her at his pack, holding the throwing weapon. Eventually, he carved her her own two-bladed boomerang and placed a leather strap around the two ends. She took it with her everywhere.</p><p>As the year progressed, Mentane’s fruit began to grow, becoming larger than usual for this type of fruit. The vine grew quickly up the post and one year to the day of its planting, Mentane emerged from his tent, ready to become a god.</p><p>His forhoral fruit was gone. In its place, he found Qathindli sitting on the forest floor, holding the remains of the forhoral fruit.</p><p>She sat and stared, her monkey mind not comprehending what was happening to her.</p><p>Mentane began ranting and raving about the amount of effort he put into the project and his loss to a monkey. In his rage, he was preparing to utterly destroy Qathindli when she turned her head toward him and shocked both he and Golar.</p><p>“What is happening to me?” she asked loudly and haltingly.</p><p>All three stared at each other for a moment before Qathindli screeched and ran off into the forest.</p><p>A few days later, Mentane packed up his belongings and stowed them on the boat. He was going to make his way back to the @UUID[JournalEntry.QVrlu0lTv2vFtT5P]{Klavek Kingdom}. Golar said that he was going to stay in the forest for the time being. They bade each other farewell and Golar watched Mentane sail off into the sunrise.</p><p>Golar found Qathindli her near her tribe of monkeys. She was speaking quickly and erratically, words from every language spilling out of her mouth. Golar understood words from a few languages and recognized several more. The other monkeys were frightened of her.</p><p>Using food, Golar tempted Qathindli out of her tree and through a long and arduous process, explained what Mentane had done with the forhoral fruit and that his best guess was that when she had eaten the fruit, she had absorbed all of the magical power invested in it and that she had become more than a monkey.</p><p>Over the course of the next six months, Golar taught Qathindli control thanks to his martial training. While she did learn how to focus her newly found thoughts, she was still a monkey inside. Her train of thought often derailed into a conglomeration of words from different languages, which made it difficult for Golar to understand.</p><p>The change in her standing among the primates came when, as she and Golar were training in a small clearing, a wild boar broke through the undergrowth and charged at Golar. Though the battle was brief, it was also incredibly violent. In the end, the boar lay dead and Golar had numerous cuts and slashes from the boar’s wicked tusks. Qathindli rushed out from her hiding place and chattered at Golar in numerous languages as he started to succumb to his injuries. As he tumbled to the ground, Qathindli placed her hands on him and with a visible light, poured healing energy into Golar.</p><p>The forest around the two of them went silent as the watchful monkeys around them looked on and saw the power that Qathindli now possessed.</p><p>While she may not have been a demigoddess in the classical sense, Qathindli has eclipsed monkeyhood and is something more. She had decided to be the protector of Treeland, which she named herself. When she accepted that mantle, she became a demigoddess.</p><h2>Appearance</h2><p>Qathindli can change her appearance to that of any primate in existence, except human. Her preferred form is a pygmy monkey that stands roughly six inches tall, with bright red hair. This form seems to cause less violent reactions in those that she speaks with than one of her larger shapes.</p><p>Each of her forms has a face that is like the race she is interacting with than it is monkey-like.</p><h2>Church</h2><p>Even though she doesn’t understand it, the humans that live in @UUID[JournalEntry.dHHrcptCELfN05gb.JournalEntryPage.eOVkEXkbiSWbkVcp#treeland]{Treeland} worship Qathindli. The services are held outside usually around midday, but it varies due to the weather.</p><p>The leader of the humans, Damon, teaches that the people of his tribe should live like the monkeys: in harmony with nature. Because of his worship, Qathindli grants him spells, even if she doesn’t know how she does that.</p><h2>Worshippers &amp; Clergy</h2><p>Qathindi’s worshippers are all of the humans that live in Treeland, under the guidance of her only clergy member, @UUID[JournalEntry.dHHrcptCELfN05gb.JournalEntryPage.Tc1kTiX3bvQt4Jd7#damon]{Damon}. One of the titles Damon has given Qathindli is “The Unsullied.” He believes that she is holy because she has never been human, and therefore is above us and unsullied by her nature.</p><h2>Holy Text</h2><p>Qathindli has no holy text to speak of. As her knowledge of language grows, she has had Golar and Damon try to teach her how to write. The two main problems are that monkey hands are not designed for holding human writing utensils and Qathindli still has the mind of a monkey, so any given sentence contains multiple languages and bad translations, making them impossible to read. Damon still collects these “writings” and keeps them safe.</p></div>","markdown":""},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}}],"_stats":{"systemId":"dnd5e","systemVersion":"2.1.4","coreVersion":"10.291","createdTime":1662054505131,"modifiedTime":1675613756888,"lastModifiedBy":"EsIYTtNnjwxUbKOG"},"ownership":{"default":0,"R5IsvMTH5P79pBoG":3},"folder":"j9cXBagzZ1ARsO2I","sort":1000000},{"_id":"QVrlu0lTv2vFtT5P","name":"Klavek Kingdom","flags":{"monks-enhanced-journal":{"scrollPos":"{\".description\":0}","_lasttab":"description"},"core":{"sourceId":"Compendium.world.deities-of-aventyr.0FSVjV3WkdoAk7OX","viewMode":1},"scene-packer":{"hash":"af13afab06a078eaa241594be40fd382a54bd348"},"cf":{"id":null}},"pages":[{"name":"Klavek Kingdom","type":"text","title":{"show":false,"level":1},"text":{"format":1,"content":"<div class=\"aventyr\"><img style=\"display:block;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto\" src=\"modules/aaw-games-aventyr/Setting-images/Klavek-Kingdom-map-750x616.webp\" width=\"483\" height=\"445\" /></div>\n<div class=\"aventyr\"> </div>\n<div class=\"aventyr\"><img style=\"float:right;margin:0px 15px 15px 0px;border:0px\" title src=\"modules/aaw-games-aventyr/Setting-images/Mohkba-Royal-Guard-small.webp\" width=\"192\" height=\"383\" />\n<p>Sometimes referred to as the Klavek Homeland by its citizens, the Klavek Kingdom hosts the most powerful military in the known world.</p>\n<p>    The Klavek Kingdom is ruled by King Tokolvor XIII, a tyrannical leader and military genius.

The early @UUID[JournalEntry.QlctNkzE9injOde9.JournalEntryPage.DXD1ygEckY0JIUFB]{Klavekians} had spread from the borders of the elven woods toward the sea and built the first realms there before that time. But since almost everything built near the sea had been destroyed by the beast, the great evacuation that followed started a new age.</p>\n<img style=\"display:block;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto\" src=\"modules/aaw-games-aventyr/Setting-images/octopus-clip-art-2-640x413.jpg\" width=\"477\" height=\"354\" />\n<p>Immunity from attack, so rare in those days, caused the eastward movement of human colonization to become reversed. That is to say, settlers began to flow back from the old-established but now ravaged colonies of the Eastern Sea to the unoccupied lands near the Serpent Tail river. This constituted the first condition which, arising out of the geographical position of Mohkba, contributed to the successful settlement of the Mohkba region. Another condition which contributed to the growth of the Principality was the fact that Mohkba stood upon a river which had always – even from the most ancient times – been possessed of great commercial importance, a waterway connecting Central Klavek with the @UUID[JournalEntry.ismpCNWpGHvB1iPw.JournalEntryPage.Erya8w29cRTTJELu]{Serpent Lake} and its untouched resources. Of course these lucky years were way before the @UUID[JournalEntry.QlctNkzE9injOde9.JournalEntryPage.I4CpK8rTs0HgD7hW]{Vikmordere} discovered there was something worth raiding on the Serpent Tail river. The third factor was that said river was not connected to the eastern ocean and thus safe from the kraken.</p>\n<img style=\"display:block;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto\" src=\"modules/aaw-games-aventyr/Setting-images/Settlement-of-Mohkba-640x480.jpg\" width=\"449\" height=\"387\" />\n<p>Yuri Dvagaslov thus made Mohkba the point where two great popular movements intersected one another – namely, a movement of colonization northeastwards along the Serpent Tail river and a movement of commerce back southeastwards toward the sea once the kraken was sleeping again. The city’s geographical position conferred great economic advantages upon the early Princes of Klavek. A large population attracted to their appanage meant a large number of direct taxpayers, while the movement of a large volume of commercial traffic on the Serpent Tail river before the Vikmordere Wars meant a stimulation of popular industry in his dominions and a large flow of transit-dues into his treasury.</p>\n<p>The physical network of rivers leading toward the lake is first of all a transportation network. The early klavekians traveled the rivers and lake by boats in summer and with sleds over the ice in winter. But the river network supported social interaction. Trading of amber, honey and furs produced economic networks. Marriage alliances and divine exchanges both produced and strengthened social networks. And the frequent interaction permitted the klavekian language to spread and become so dominant over a wide area that it is now known simply as ‘common’.</p>\n<h2>Mohkba today</h2>\n<p>Mohkba has lots of quiet cozy lanes, wooden houses, an incredible number of monasteries and churches, and delicious pickles are on sale on every corner. The capital of Klavek is known for its great towers, most belonging to churches, but others to the nobility or to wizards. When alliances are forged due to marriages, illusions of bridges adorned with shared banners connect the towers, creating an ever changing scenery. Mohkba is composed out of eight quarters. Nobility and commoners share all Quarters, except for the vast @UUID[.LGCNFtJ4cWlq0HjE#gardeners-quarter]{Gardener’s quarter} where but a handful of druids live, the @UUID[.LGCNFtJ4cWlq0HjE#arcane-quarter]{Fortress of Arcane Arts }which is reserved for Magicians and Alchemists and assumed to be a dangerous place anyhow, and the small @UUID[.LGCNFtJ4cWlq0HjE#kings-fortress]{King’s quarter} where only royalty has their homes.

It was built so long ago that there are no written evidences, which had led to speculations about it being placed there by the gods themselves. Be this as it may, the powerful monolithic massive structure of the monument still dominates not only the divine quarter, but the whole historic center of @UUID[.dwAJ5Jtc6ii8zQoh]{Mohkba}. The basis of its complex three-dimensional architecture is a four-domed, five-columned brick temple of the cross-and-cupola type with a high ground floor. It is built of brick and blue stone, and its blind arcades give it a special beauty and nobility. In the interior of this palladion a faithfuls attention is drawn by the unique historically formed iconostases icons. These are ancient mural paintings, national relics of Klavek that include the famous icon of Yuri Dvagaslov himself, the Holy Knight of the Crossroad. In the course of hundreds of years the Sophianeum was a center of the clerical, political and cultural life of ancient Mohkba.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<img style=\"float:right;margin:0px 15px 15px 0px;border:0px\" src=\"modules/aaw-games-aventyr/Setting-images/085-Cathedral-Tower-from-St-Johns-Street.jpg\" width=\"237\" height=\"316\" />\n<p>     Next to the Sophianeum is Alvarov’s Monastery that was founded by Prince Yaroslav the Witch as early as in the first century after the foundation of Mohkba, as a legend reads, and one cannot help being amazed by the striking beauty of another masterpiece of ancient Klavekian architecture. Many experts of Klavekian art justly believe Mohkba to be blessed by the Gods; no other old Klavekian cities have managed to preserve so many ancient architectural monuments adorned with wall murals. Visitors will see that with their own eyes visiting the churches of the Oreadean Gods on Vlassov Lake, appreciating at its true worth the old frescoes of world-famous Wulfgarin the Dwarf in the Church of the Enchantments on Vassili Street; singularly graceful murals in the Church of the Spirit of Bertramov on Prideful Field, admiring the beautiful clerical wall calendar of the Church of the Nameless Hero and studying wonderful mural compositions in The Sinless Cathedral. The later is also famous for its five-tier iconostasis with icons from up to four centuries ago.</p>\n<p>More mundane, but still very important are the Tower of the Inquisition and the Tower of the Order of the Elk, the latter the chivalric arm of the former and thus connected by a real bridge, one of the oldest non-illusionary bridges connecting Mohkba’s towers.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h3>Armour of Frozen Tears</h3>\n<p>When the @UUID[JournalEntry.QlctNkzE9injOde9.JournalEntryPage.I4CpK8rTs0HgD7hW]{Vikmordere} attacked @UUID[.dwAJ5Jtc6ii8zQoh]{Mohkba} in the old days, legend says that the face of Tsar Alexei VI was awash in tears of wrath, and that it was so cold during that attack that his tears freeze before hitting the ground. Those frozen tears were collected by a dwarven cleric and with the aid of an unknown smith forged into an armour of sparkling brilliance. Tsar Alexei himself wore the armour in the counterattack, when he charged the enemy at the front of his soldiers, and the vile Vikmordere magic dissipated into waterdrops while hitting the tsar, unable to harm him. While most of this tale seems to be a legend, the armour indeed does exist, and the tsars do wear it on the days of their coronation since the days of Tsar Gregory VI, twin brother and successor of Alexei. The armour is clearly magical, since it adjusts to the size of the monarch and even fitted Tsarina Anna’s very womanly body when her coronation came.</p>\n<p>The Armour of Frozen Tears is sky blue in colour, and in form unlike any other armour, though it somewhat resembles a flowing plate mail. The is no crest on the armour, nor any other sign, and, contradicting a then common legend, it can be worn by anyone, as was obvious after Mikhael the jester put it on during a festival. The armour also doesn’t prevent its wearer from being beheaded, which was also proven by said jester and the bodyguard of the enraged tsar. ‘To put on the frozen tears’ is now a common proverb for a daunting deed that went horribly wrong.</p>\n<p>The Armour of Frozen Tears is kept in the @UUID[.LGCNFtJ4cWlq0HjE#divine-quarter]{Sophianeum} and on display there, constantly guarded by a watch of honour.</p>\n<h3>The Tombstone of Bojar Pjotr</h3>\n<p>The Tombstone of Bojar Pjotr, build from marble and engraved with silver letters, describes the birth- and death-days of the Bojar Pjotr, who was known for his racial tolerance, and his bride, an unnamed Othyugh, who ate him at their wedding ceremony before being killed by the guests. Since that day the tombstone is used to promote racial purism, to be an outstanding example of foolish behaviour, to always come armed to a wedding and for lots of other more or less sensible things. But over the years the jokes gradually went sour, for even as Pjotr didn’t leave any relatives, the tombstone is always polished, and fresh flowers do appear next to it on the day of his birth, the day of both deaths and on a third day, which is supposed to be the birthing day of the proud bride. In later years a small fence was build around the tombstone, and now lovers faced with huge obstacles throw a flower inside the fenced area, where they lie fresh long after that should be possible, only to vanish without trace when another flower is thrown inside. It is known that the burden of the lovers is eased in some minor way as long as their flower is inside the fence, and that each pair of lovers may only throw one flower for this boon. Should there be no major obstacle to the love, or a second flower be thrown, then their flower withers away immediately, without replacing the last one, and bad luck is guaranteed for a month and a day. It also seems to matter what flower is chosen, a rose having other effects than a lily for instance, but that may be coincidence. Nonetheless there have been desperate lovers who went searching for a @UUID[JournalEntry.ismpCNWpGHvB1iPw.JournalEntryPage.w79VOo3UeUGraouv#winterflower]{Winterflower}, a rare wildflower supposed to grow in the northern mountains near the outpost of @UUID[JournalEntry.ismpCNWpGHvB1iPw]{Rybalka}, to better their chances for success.</p>\n<h3>Cold Iron Gate</h3>\n<p>The Cold Iron Gate is the impressive relict of a great effort to defeat the @UUID[JournalEntry.QlctNkzE9injOde9.JournalEntryPage.ei36LjIhEoh87vgE]{elves} and their fey allies once and for all. There is much disagreement about the details of the plan, but most sages agree that all walls and gates of @UUID[.dwAJ5Jtc6ii8zQoh]{Mohkba} were planned to be coated in cold iron. There are many different opinions about details though, if every town of the realm was to be coated in cold iron, and if the cold iron was meant to hold the fey outside or trap them inside instead. There is even a discussion if the elves themselves were hampered by cold iron in those ancient days, since they clearly aren’t in modern times. Whatever it is, after one gate was ready the whole plan was stopped due to lack of money. In modern days the Gate is infamous on the one hand, leading to the proverb of ‘he even has a cold iron toilet’ for someone with too much money, but oddly something of pride also, for it was a very ambitious project to say the least, and even unfinished its a symbol for Mohkba aiming very high. The Cold Iron Gate itself is somewhat barren, there are no gravels, signs or whatever in it, and has a dull blue colour that has appeared over time, since old texts describe the gate as being the colour of a grey stormcloud. Watchmen tell that the Cold Iron Gate is easier to close and to open then other gates of equal size. No invader has ever tried to break this gate down, so the ultimate test for the defensive attributes has not happened yet.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>Arcane Quarter</h2>\n<p> </p>\n<img style=\"float:right;margin:0px 15px 15px 0px;border:0px\" src=\"modules/aaw-games-aventyr/Setting-images/Wizard-with-Golem.webp\" width=\"252\" height=\"346\" />\n<p>The Arcane quarter is the only part of Mohkba without religious buildings. Not contend with lonely wizardly towers, the arcane wielders of Mohkba combined their resources to build the emerald fortress in the then Arcane suburb, now known as the somewhat infamous Fortress of the Arcane Arts. This fortress was mentioned in chronicles as early as five years after the foundation of the Sophianeum. The present walls and towers were constructed in a single night 200 years later. The central building of the emerald fortress is the four-domed college of Mutamateria, nicknamed ‘Transformation Cathedral’ to the chargrin of the clerics. The walls of the college are separated by pilasters with zakomari that were adorned with painting as far back as the 4th century after its foundation. The pinnacle of architecture when it was erected has a grandiose size and sensational shape, with eight cupolas, one for each school of magic, dazzling with luxury and an abundance of tiles, brick patterns and frescos. It is a real encyclopedia of arcane scenes which has no equivalent in Klavekian art. Today it is also connected with, or somewhat has overgrown, the Alchemists College, with is now part of the emerald fortress.</p>\n<h2>King’s Fortress</h2>\n<img style=\"float:right;margin:0px 15px 15px 0px;border:0px\" src=\"modules/aaw-games-aventyr/Setting-images/elizabethan-costumes-3.jpg\" width=\"270\" height=\"288\" />\n<p>The King’s Fortress was closely related to all the most important events in the life of ancient Mohkba: hosting foreign embassies, seeing-off warriors to fight the enemy, convening meetings of the Crown’s Advisors. Many centuries ago, the whole fortress was surrounded by ramparts, on which stood strong log walls and fortress towers. They served as reliable protection during the internecine wars of the Klavekian princes, but were later burned by Vikmordere invaders. Today, in a much safer age, nothing but a high wall remains.</p>\n<p>In addition to the above-mentioned Sophianeum, the King’s Fortress also features other striking monuments as the Faceted Palace – a rare specimen of elven architecture, built in the times of Vassily Elf-Friend jointly with elven masters, as well as the impressive and beautiful bellfry with a set of adamantit bells. In the central square of the King’s Fortress stands the monument “The Millenium of Klavek”, designed by Quincov the Stout and erected a bit prematurely 940 years after the foundation of Klavek by Tsar Alexei the Impatient. This unique document in bronze immortalizes all those who greatly contributed to the development of the country: its culture, science, art and literature, but also its tsars and war-heroes. The klavekian special political structure, spiritual freedom and territorial independence were highly favorable to the evolution of culture and art, and this is justly celebrated in the political heart of Klavek. Mohkba is one of the greatest art centers of the human world. Its architectural traditions, skaldic tales, school of icon-painting, jeweler’s and decorative applied art became famous all over the known world. Mohkba also is Klavekia’s major center of literacy and book production. As far back as the foundation years, by the will of the great Prince Yuri Dvagaslov himself, Mohkba saw the first school to train three hundred children at a time.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h3>The Emerald Casket</h3>\n<p>Once only known to a selected few trusted advisors of the Tsar, @UUID[.LGCNFtJ4cWlq0HjE#the-bridge-that-is-there-and-not-there]{ The Bridge That Is There And Not} There is supposed to be not the only legacy of Grigory Rivalnov. During the Time of Troubles a group of mercenaries took hold of the @UUID[.LGCNFtJ4cWlq0HjE#kings-fortress]{King’s Fortress} for a short time, and from these originated what is now a common legend. Deep under the King’s Fortress there’s an emerald casket, presumably holding the last of the Sinner Tsars in suspension, until a time where the lineage of Tsars is broken. There are some facts contradicting this tale, as the lineage of Tsars has been broken a few times in the past (most famously after the death of Tsarina Anna in 1143) and suspension doesn’t sound like illusionist magic, but still the legend persists. The Casket itself is rumored to be a huge emerald, hence the name, with a vague ageless male human shape enclosed in it. While nobody reliable has set her eyes on the casket in recent decades and talked about it, there are nonetheless many works of art depicting it in the city, even one monument in @UUID[.LGCNFtJ4cWlq0HjE#mariners-quarter]{Mariner’s Quarter}. Those works vary in many details from each other though, and there are ongoing and somewhat heated discussions which one looks more like the famous original.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>Trade-yard</h2>\n<p>On the opposite bank of the river, reachable by a footbridge, is Beatricov’s Court and the ancient Trade-yard, displaying many still-standing monuments of the early days of Klavek, all reminiscent of the busy trade life of Mohkba in the days before the Vikmordere Wars. Originally made of wood, it was almost completely destroyed by fire. Later new walls with defensive towers were erected. Not surprisingly, the symbol of the Trade-yard is a stone fortress, surrounded by an even more ancient earthen wall.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<img style=\"float:right;margin:0px 15px 15px 0px;border:0px\" src=\"modules/aaw-games-aventyr/Setting-images/237-The-Butcher-Newport-Market-Alley.jpg\" width=\"258\" height=\"233\" />\n<p>Nearly every house in the Trade-yard has a unique history and the central part of the quarter is one big architectural complex. The Beatricovan trading gallery is one of the biggest complexes in Klavekia. The layout is based on the plan of a typical merchant’s shop with trading on the ground floor and storage rooms in the attic and cellar. Rumors place the home of Klavek’s Thieves Guild here, but surely the Tsar’s Inquisitors would have ferreted this out long ago if there was any truth to the rumor.</p>\n<p>The most famous monument of the Trade-yard certainly is the Cube of Names for the most famous warrior-heroes of the first days of Mohkba, the greatest clerics, summoners, magi and oracles. The lower side on which the cube rests is supposed to show the names of rogues, the tsar’s under-hand, hidden even in the present. In the Trade-yard the ancient contracts are still stored, including such world-famous items as a great number of birch-bark scrolls and lead seals dating back to the founding years. These are indicative of a unique and striking level of literacy among ancient klavekians who were certainly and contrary to elven prejudices no barbarians at all and had a highly organized system of state control from the beginning.</p>\n<h3>The Hundred Candle Steps</h3>\n<p>When Yevgeni VI. married the elven lady Arianna Greenleaf in 692 his bride did make a grand entrance into @UUID[.dwAJ5Jtc6ii8zQoh]{Mohkba}. The last hundred steps of hers before she kissed the Tsar for the first time left footprints on the street, and immediatly after her delicate feet left the street a single cobblestone in each footprint went into tiny flames. Those flames still burn, a small but bright yellow light, unless @UUID[.ulLkhApELbg08M4o]{Klavek} is at war with the elves, when the flames change colour to blue.</p>\n<p>The flames may be extinguished easily, but they reflame on their own after a few minutes. They are unaffected by normal wind. The street were they are located is the street of the candlemakers and other trades who can use the handy open flames for their trade. It is one of the few tolerated displays of magic in the town since a rampaging troll could be stopped with help of these flames many years ago.</p>\n<h3>The Grand Scales</h3>\n<p>The @UUID[.LGCNFtJ4cWlq0HjE#trade-yard]{Trade-yard} has seen its share of good trades and bad trades, but also of frauds and con artists. Tsar Ironhand has had enough of that one day after his custom officers were cheated on a stormy night with a wooden block coated in gold and he commissioned the building of the Grand Scale, which is the height of a small building and able to weigh up to two tons of raw material. Its difficult and time consuming to handle, but very accurate and gives a +2 to appraise checks for raw materials. Rumours say that both the con artist and the custom officers are all part of the scale now, having been turned into the construction by magic or melted together with the iron from which is was built. In stormy nights they are rumoured to still wail for the tsars mercy.</p>\n<h2>Carpenter’s Quarter</h2>\n<p>Like every other separated part of Mohkba Carpenter’s Quarter has its own wall. The main gate connecting Carpenter’s quarter to the King’s Fortress has a famous décor on the outside, comprising three monumental tile compositions: To the right of the southern portal is a round bas-relief depicting Prince Yaroslav the Witch and under the arches of the side facades are two scenes of workers laboring. These unique ancient Klavekian tiles date back to first century after the foundation.</p>\n<p>The other way into this quarter is Nikolsky Gate. Behind it is the small “bridge of happiness,” hung with padlocks. At the edges of the bridge are two horseshoes of a centaur, one of which reads: “Eternal Love” in the language of the horsefolk. Holding hands, lovers go through the large horseshoe and walk on the eight small ones on the bridge. According to legend, a female centaur ambassador broke its horseshoe here on a stone, being dazzled by the sight of a Klavekian cavalry officer. To this day the “stone of desires” sits close to the bridge.</p>\n<p>Despite its name, Carpenter’s quarter has long been famous for its furriers and shoemakers. On the streets are a lot of wooden houses, stone mansion from the end of the century before last, as well as trading arcades new and preserved.</p>\n<p>Carpenter’s quarter is also known for its Abandoned Monastry, a building which stands empty for about 300 years now. Here False Yuri II (Grishka Raulyev) met the nun Tatyana, the widow of Alexei IV, Maria Poterowa, who had entered the monastery. She recognized the pretender as her son, Yuri. This was the trigger for the Troubles, an euphemistic name for one of the meanest of the Klavekian civil wars. Due to that sad part of Klavekian history the monastery is empty now, but still a fantastic sight. In the old days, in the minds of the people, the greatness of a monastery was always connected to the height of its belltower. The architectural center of the Carpenter’s Quarter is one of the highest belltowers in Klavekia, more than 89 meters high. Monumental and steadfast, it does not look overly heavy because of its many columns, wide arched openings and decoration, which contains Alexei’s monograms. The dome of the seven-storied belltower is decorated with the imperial crown – the monastry had always been under the special patronage of the tsars. On the orders of Metropolitan Vladimir, 8 bells were cast for it, including “The Bear”, the largest bell in Mohkba. Each has its own tone, but all together they allow the ringer to create a perfect harmonic composition, a gem of world cultural heritage, the Mohkba chimes. When the angels first heard it legend claimed they cried, creating the lake of Mohkba. Since the Troubles the bells are silent and refuse to ring, a sign that toppled the claim of false Yuri II more than anything else. Countless priests and magicians have tried to revive the chime since those days to no avail. Standing near “The Bear” they could only enjoy the stunning views of the river and the Bridge of Happiness across it.</p>\n<p>The boundless forests outside Mohkba behind the bridge are equally beautiful in summer as in winter, in morning as in evening. Mohkba and Mohkba region have long been intensely cultivated by man, perhaps more than any other region of Klavekia. Yet nature still occupies a huge part of it with clean lakes and rivers, and wild forests. It is hard to believe, but today forests still cover a huge part of Mohkba region, and with some luck one can still see wild animals looking from the belltower. One should take care though, the monastry is neglected and the stairs are somewhat unsafe.</p>\n<h3>The Bridge That Is There And Not There</h3>\n<p>Grigorij Rivalnov was the greatest Illusionist Mohkba has known in its long history, living in the days of the Sinner Tsars. It is told that once, at the 25th birthday of Tsar Anatol V., he changed the whole capital so that it looked like covered in molted gold, sparkling in the sunrise. Another story is not that beautiful, telling a tale where the Illusionist came to the Tsarina in the night disguised by foul magic to resemble the Tsar. Whether that tale is true or not, it was used against the Tsarevitch during the civil war after the death of Anatol V., claiming the young prince to be a wizard’s bastard. It was one of the many reasons why magic is so distrusted in Klavek up to the present time.</p>\n<p>Be the stories true or false, most of Rivalnov’s illusion have been banned or timed out over the long years since his death, save for the famous Bridge That Is There And Not There, or Rivalnov’s Bridge. It looks like a sturdy stone bridge, including small statues of famous citizens of Mohkba from the time where it was cast, most prominent among them the tsar and tsarina (but not the tsarevitch) in the middle of it. The bridge is famous enough that most people of Klavek know its an illusion, but nonetheless whoever attemps to cross it for the first time has to make a will save. If she fails, she is able to cross it for the rest of her life, even inside a carriage if every other passenger and the horses failed also. If she succeeds, she falls straight through the illusion and most likely takes a cold bath in the river. Most citizens of Mohkba are able to cross the bridge freely, having failed their save as children when they still believed in wonders.</p>\n<p>Of course its a common prank among teenagers to guide foreigners over the bridge, telling them about the illusion while doing so and laughing the moment the strangers take a bath.</p>\n<h3>The Unprotected Ruby</h3>\n<p>On a plaza in the midst of @UUID[.LGCNFtJ4cWlq0HjE#carpenters-quarter]{Carpenter’s Quarter} is an ebony pedestal with a flawless fist-sized red ruby on it. It is not protected by any means, and in fact has been stolen four times already, but always was returned in a week at most. It is obviously worth a fortune, should someone find a buyer for it, but doing that is the difficult part. Tied to the ruby is bad luck of the gravest sort, so most who did ever handle it for more than a few hours died horribly, and no one has managed to break that curse, if it is a curse at all. If the gem is returned to the pedestal all is well again, save for some scars, wounds or broken bones from the time of possessing the gem, but no unusual bad luck happens again. Sages have wondered about the properties of the Unprotected Ruby for long, and examined it – usually from afar – but no one knows its secret. Legend claims one tsar or another, the details vary, paid tribute to the @UUID[JournalEntry.QlctNkzE9injOde9.JournalEntryPage.I4CpK8rTs0HgD7hW]{Vikmordere} with this specially prepared gem, to weaken the enemy by cursing their leaders, but the gem had been returned after some time or never delivered at all after killing its maker in a weird accident which centered around a goose, a flower and a nail.</p>\n<h3>Watching Torches</h3>\n<p>In the Street of the Eye, where once the royal treasury was located, is one of the few magical features of Mohkba of the divine nature. Dating back to the years of Pjotr the Pius in ancient times the Grand Robbery of the treasury shook @UUID[.dwAJ5Jtc6ii8zQoh]{Mohkba} to the core. Pjotr did pray to the Guardian God for help against further occurences of this kind, and some claim that he could do not much else but pray after being poor like a goblin thanks to the thieves. Be this as it may, the street once leading to the treasury has magical torches to this day. They catch fire the moment an intelligent creature comes in 40 feet of them, and they sputter out with no one in the vicinity any longer. It was a very efficient warning system until the Second Great Robbery of the treasury which was committed with the help of golems. After the @UUID[JournalEntry.QlctNkzE9injOde9.JournalEntryPage.I4CpK8rTs0HgD7hW]{Vikmordere} plundered the treasury twice, each time illuminated by torchlight, it was relocated to a more secure location, and today wonderworkers, con artists and charlatans have their shops in the torchlit street, to the chargrin of many clerics. They sell everything, from splinters of the true bowl that graced the Empty Pedestal once, enough of them to build a glass dome over @UUID[.dwAJ5Jtc6ii8zQoh]{Mohkba} as the critics claim, to bones of the Sinner Tsars or the head of the Vikmordere chieftain Angus the Old from the days when he was still a child. Sometimes true magic can be found here, so its a place visited by many for its sense of wonder and promises.</p>\n<h3>The Floating Tower</h3>\n<p>When Klavek was young and mostly build of wood two rival families had a feud with each other that slowly escalated. One night the tower of one of the families was put to the torch by its rival, and the ground burned to ashes – but the ground only. The tower is still there to this day, the only wooden tower of this height in the town, but it has no first floor. Indeed it floats from the second floor up, but it stays in place no matter the wind. It was even inhabitat a while afterwards, but with the distrust in magic growing the family that owned it later moved away and now is rumoured to have left no inheritors. There have been some attempts in the past to remove or destroy the floating tower, but none did succeed so far. Today the floating tower is protected by the military, mostly to prevent hotheads from another attempt to burn it – along with the rest of the town while trying.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>Mariner’s quarter</h2>\n<p>Mariner’s quarter is the underbelly of @UUID[.dwAJ5Jtc6ii8zQoh]{Mohkba}, known for its cheap brothels and ramshackle pubs. But even in this bad place is a national icon to be found, the Navy Museum, a colorful painted wooden house. It exhibits the wooden boat, great-grandfather of Klavekia’s navy, that was sent out on the water of the Lake of Angelic Tears by the young Tsar Alexei III. Sadly that’s the only thing exhibited in the whole museum.</p>\n<p>According to legend, there was a stone idol standing in what is now the Mariner’s quarter that the ancient centaurs worshiped. The hermit Natalya prayed and received a magical staff from a divine elk with which she destroyed the idol, and then built a church on the site of the pagan shrine. Before going to fight the Vikmordere, Tsar Alexei the Twin made a pilgrimage to the monastery to take the staff of Natalya. After the battle of the Serpent, the tsar in gratitude built a cathedral where the church stood, one of the first multi-altar churches, which have additional altars dedicated to different gods. The interior of this cubic six-domed church is unusual: The arches are supported by five pillars, which gives the effect of volume. It could justifiably be called the pearl of that period of Klavekian architecture and its domes, walls, door frames and all other available surfaces are full of mural paintings. In modern days the cathedral is seldom visited, and but the altar of the gods dedicated to the sea and to long voyages is cleaned regularly. The staff of Natalya is rumored to have inspired Tarissov the Leprous in building the first @UUID[.1hMoSKS1OqlchIwq#the-blank-staffs]{Blank Staff}. This made his treason the more unbearable and added to the neglect of the Church of Natalya’s Staff.</p>\n<h3>The Empty Pedestal</h3>\n<p>In the Harbour area stands the famous Empty Pedestal, by itself a rather blank structure with no artistic value whatsoever, but in ancient time Leo II, The Tsar in the Bowl, had his crystal home on this pedestal overlooking the harbour and looking for outside help to break his curse. Its not clear who cursed him or why, and tales blame everyone from the Vikmordere, the clerics, the magicians to his own relatives for the vile deed. His grandson did break the bowl in 173, not wanting to be a mere regent as his father has been, thereby killing the tsar or what was left of him and provoking a short civil war known as the days of the Cleared Succession or the days of the Murdering Tsar by his enemies. The infamous victory speech by Tsar Leo IV was held standing on the very pedestal that held his grandfather for so many decades, and it was one of the longest and most winding speeches in the history of Mohkba, rumoured to have crashed the last resistance to his rule by boring all dissidents to death. Leo IV was known as the chattering tsar or the shattering tsar for many decades until Tsar Anatol VIII decided the matter almost 150 years later by naming Leo IV the Tsar who Broke the Bowl. Until today the people of Mohkba express their feelings toward the government by placing various fishes on the empty pedestal, each of them with a different meaning. Knowing which fish means what is a science in itself and a riddle to even many people of Mohkba, let alone foreign guests. Most governments see any fish in any position and any state of decay as an insult to them nowadays, which lets the pedestal been guarded most of the time and certainly when government is cutting public spending or raising taxes.</p>\n<h3>Dancing Skeleton</h3>\n<p>Once during the many wars with the Vikmordere a regiment of Klavekian archers managed to surprise a ritual by the Vikmordere. Suspecting a vile purpose of this ritual the archers peppered everyone attending in the grove, slaying everyone – almost. When the storm of arrows ceased, only the leading shaman was still on his feet and dancing, amidst a sea of dead. The next volley of arrows hit him exclusively, but, even being obviously dead, the dance continued. The Klavekian were scared, but took the shaman captive, without getting any response from him. Even bound he twitched in his dance moved with vacant, dead eyes. Back in Mohkba the shaman was showered with positive energy to no avail and ultimately thrown in a pool of acid, where his flesh receded, but his skeleton still danced. It was bound again and put away in a deep cell.</p>\n<p>An unknown number of decades later Tsar Alexei V., later called the ‘Mad Tsar’, decided to bolster morale of the citizens by putting the shaman on display. So the skeleton dances on a pedestal, at first closely watched by clerics and guards, but these days only by an honour guard of veterans of Klavekian skirmishes or battles with the Vikmordere. Oddly enough the few Vikmordere ambassadors that have visited Mohkba and seen the shaman have been reported to not be offended by the sight, but smiling knowingly, which unsettled more than one of the veterans guarding the Dancing Skeleton. But since the skeleton is dancing for more than 250 years by now and nothing visibly bad has come out of it yet, the citizens of Mohkba see the Dancing Skeleton as nothing more than a celebrated oddity, a trophy of war and a symbol of the weirdness of their Vikmordere neighbors.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h3>Spitting Statue</h3>\n<p>At the harbour of @UUID[.dwAJ5Jtc6ii8zQoh]{Mockba} is the statue of Dimitrij Denisonovitch, most honoured advisor to Tsar Pjotr the Diplomat and, for a very short time, of his successor Alexei the Twin. Denisonovitch is portrait as an especially ugly man, with an evil looking face, a long hook-like nose and a hunchback. It is well known that he featured none of this in his life, having been a rather handsome and charismatic man, but he counseled his Tsars toward accepting surrender and tribute to the Vikmordere, like Mohkba paid to the Saatman Empire before. His statue was erected to remember the people of the price of betrayal, for Denisonovitch was beheaded on the very first day of the reign of Alexei the Twin in 1096 for this craven council, and until this day passerby spit on the statue as their sign of national pride. There are rumours though that before 1096 there had been another statue of Denisonovitch, built by Pjotr the Diplomat for former successes of his councellor, showing the real self with a concerned face, and some people did cut themselves in front of this statue of Denisonovitch to let a drop of blood or two spill at his feet, for in the first battles of the Twin’s war theVikmordere claimed much blood of Mohkba and won most of them. Denisonovitchs council seemed wiser those days, but with the shifting tides of war and victory increasingly favouring Mohkba the old statue was toppled and later replaced by the new and ugly one, and today a different body fluid is offered to the advisor that failed from grace.</p>\n<h3>Statue of the Shamans</h3>\n<p>In the Vikmordere wars, Mohkba was frequently plundered, at least in parts, but at one time the Vikmordere tried to stay to conquer the town of their enemies once and for all. Chieftain Angus the Old died shortly after this decision, many claiming being struck down by the gods for his decision, and the Vikmordere went away to being splintered tribes as before. But a relic from those days is the statue of ice, vaguely build like a sea snake, was left behind by the Vikmordere. It still is in the @UUID[.LGCNFtJ4cWlq0HjE#mariners-quarter]{Mariner’s Quarter} as a warning from the Vikmordere threat, an oddity from times long past, and a part of the city defences. The serpent statue has a faint glimmer of conjuration magic. If touched and used as a focus component during the casting of summon swarm, summon monster or summon nature’s ally, and the spell is used to summon a serpent swarm or giant serpent, the spell lasts for an additional round, and, in the case of a summoned swarm, the swarm does not attack the caster, so long as he retains hold of the statue, allowing him to stand freely in the area of the swarm. The statue provides no such protection against serpent swarms conjured by others or encountered normally.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>Gardener’s quarter</h2>\n<p>On the Gardener’s quarter’s central square, Natalyaskaya Ploshchad, stands a monument in honor of the hermit Natalya. Natalyaskaya Ploshchad practically runs into another square, named after Yuri Sansurov who sacrificed his life for the sake of young tsar Alexei the Twin. Outside Gardener’s Quarter is Chistoye Boloto, the clean bog, into which Sansurov led the Vikmordere who had come to capture the Klavekian tsar, there by sacrifying himself for his tsar.</p>\n<p>The Gardener’s quarter has an elk farm in honor of Natalya the hermit. This is one of the few places in the world where druids have been successfully breeding elks for 90 years now. Pilgrims can not only take a good look at the elks but interact with them too. Trying elk milk is an absolute must since it has an unusual flavor and is known to grant divine favors every few years.</p>\n<p>There are about 15 gardens and parks in the Gardener’s quarter alone. A favorite recreation spot is the pine wood within its center. Here is the Klavekian Calling celebrated, the traditional custom for greeting the spring, calling the elks and the warming sun. Its on a small but long hill with a spring near its top, and in winter few children can resist the temptation to slide down the frozen slippery slope on their backsides or on sledges. The spring is also famous throughout Mohkba for its water purity.</p>\n<p>There are more than 13 bridges in the quarter. Many artisans come here for inspiration, which visitors are reminded of by monuments to writers, painters and druids that decorate gardens, parks and promenades. In the warm season there are six fountains in the squares and parks leading to ponds, little waterfalls and a boulder three-span bridge decorated with a unique carved iconostasis of rose, walnut and birch.</p>\n<p>Gardeners quarter was once the private property of the son of a simple Gardener. In childhood he fled from his father to a neighboring village, where he lived with the priest and sang in church. His beautiful voice drew the attention of a major who was driving by, who took the boy and brought him to Mohkba, to the delight of the tsarina, Tatjana Valakova, who loved his beautiful singing. The 22-year-old ‘voice of an angel’ became involved with the princess Anna Alexeievna. After she became tsarina, she awarded her lover some property and the rank of general, marrying him in secret. The influence wielded by this favorite of the tsarina became colossal, as did his wealth and land ownership. However, Gregory the Gardener remained throughout a modest and pious man, who financed the construction of many churches and always viewed his exalted status with humor. Later, when offering an explanation for Anna’s choice, one of her nieces recalled Gregory as one of the most beautiful men she had met in her whole life. After his death he dedicated his beloved garden to the people of Mohkba, to be tended by druids, and thus Gardener’s Quarter was founded and named after him.</p>\n<h2>Zveni Island</h2>\n<p>The Mohkba Lake’s individual shape can be explained by its glacial origins. It is in fact several lakes, joined to each other by short narrow canals, stretching in a chain from west to east for 50 kilometers. At its eastern end, at the mouth of Serpent Tail River, is Zveni Island. Its thus far away from the capital, but Alexei the Twin deemed it so important that he named it part of the capital itself, and that was never changed. The decision made Mohkba the biggest town of the world, at least if one measures size by east-west miles.</p>\n<p>On the remote Zveni island a monastery had been built, which today is connected with the mainland by bridge. In the early days of the empire a hermit called Gregory settled on the island. He was given the nickname Stolbensky, from the word “stolb” meaning pillar. After his death, fame spread far and wide of his the healing power, and the monastery became a center of pilgrimage, one of the largest in Klavekia. Not many years later an unique ensemble came together, and today the monastery comprises seven churches and 30 buildings in the tradition of Mohkba architecture. The shores of the island were reinforced with granite embankments. The monastery became a veritable “city of clerics,” a little part of Mohkba by some miracle abandoned in the wilderness of the region.</p>\n<p>As told in a legend, Zveni got its name, ‘bell-tolling’, thanks to its bells, which rang out for hundreds of miles around. When neighboring villages heard them, they also began to sound the alarm by tolling bells, and so on until the signal reached Mohkba, warning the capital of the kingdom of the approach of the Vikmordere enemy. Thus, Zverni was destroyed many times, and rebuilt after every attack. The Tsars did this in part out of piety, in part out of military thoughts and in part because the island became sort of a repository for unwanted wives and daughters and politically dangerous persons of both genders. To die on the island is said to grant a dying limited wish, but it has to be worded carefully and can’t have a political or military approach, for the first tsar who had died on the island, Gregory the Other Twin, also known as the Shortlived, had wished it so.</p>\n<p>Entry to the monastery is through two arches, one of which stands at the bridge, and the other at the pier. Rebuilt only a few years ago, it nonetheless is famous for its rich decoration of klavekian baroque and frescoes in the style of oreadean masters. The main hall is bright and spacious with four pillars that bear arches. On the walls are two thematic series: seven paintings depicting the various battles with the Vikmordere and four illustrating the Miracles of Gregory Stolbensky.</p>\n<p>Water clarity in this part of the lake can be up to 5 meters. The lake is inhabited by about 20 species of fish, including smelt, bream, perch, burbot, whitefish, ide and pike, but also the occasional sea serpent. The forests are rich with game and poultry. There is a park on the shore, overlooking the lake, and a cape in the south of the island is covered with meadows. On the very point of the headland is a snow-white church which has miraculously survived the last two Vikmordere attacks unharmed.</p>\n</div>","markdown":""},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"sort":700000,"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}},{"name":"Klavekian Grasslands","type":"text","_id":"J642N3NDDUewmTFn","title":{"show":false,"level":1},"image":{},"text":{"format":1,"content":"<div class=\"aventyr\"><p class=\"s5\">Klavekian Grasslands</p><h2>Weather</h2><p>The winters on the Klavekian Grasslands last seven to nine months. Temperatures vary from −40 °C to 36 °C throughout the year. The summers are short but sometimes even hot, with plant life exploding as to make up for a whole year in but a few weeks.</p><p>The grassy plains in the Klavekian lowlands are a very windy area, with winds often blowing upwards of 40–90 km/h. It lies on top of permanently frozen soil called permafrost.</p><p>During the spring, the permafrost thaws just enough to let plants grow and reproduce. The ground below it stays frozen though, so the water can’t sink low, and so forms the streams, lakes and marshes found during the snowless months.</p><p>Rivers of the Klavekian Grassland flow over the same permafrost, so they erode their banks rather than the bottoms. They usually consist of countless channels, and can be difficult to cross. Most of them dry out after the end of the thawing period, leaving not many traces behind them until the next spring.</p><p>Most of the permanent rivers freeze to the bottom in some places. Water breaks the ice and then freezes on top of it. These ice plugs, called naled in the region, often don’t melt until the next autumn. If this happens on the important Serpent Tail River, which connects the @UUID[.ulLkhApELbg08M4o]{Klavekian mainlands} to the @UUID[JournalEntry.ismpCNWpGHvB1iPw.JournalEntryPage.Erya8w29cRTTJELu]{Serpent Lake}, it’s a major obstacle for trade, so the government sends spellcasters to remove these dangers by magical fire. Travel is not easy in these times of the year, and sometimes there are casualties in spite of the government efforts. Locals want the magicians to be permanently located near their villages, or at least for the duration of winter, but that has not been ordered so far despite of the protests.</p><p></p><h2>Flora</h2><p>As soon as the snow melts, the “Klavekian Pervenets” (The Firstborn) grows up thickly around the rivers and lakes. This huge grassy plant announces the start of the growing season after the winter is gone. Its juice has a sweet taste, but leaves blisters and sores on the skin that ache for months and has a 50% chance of lowering the dexterity score by one point until healed. The people of the three villages extract a form of sweet sugar out of it, and also distill wine that produces wonderful dreams after just one or two glasses. The dreams can carry portents sometimes; there is a 5% chance per glass drunk, up to a maximum of 10%, that the drinker can cast augury like a caster of third level right after waking up, regardless of his real class level or even if she is no spellcaster at all. The augury may happen or not, but another side effect does always take place; in the morning the drinker feels miserable and is nauseated for the next three hours per glass imbibed. Strangely the wine distilled out of Klavekian Pervenets as well as the juice itself loses its potency after only three days, so transporting it to larger markets is a huge challenge.</p><p>Maybe even better known in Klavek is one kind of plant that appears shortly after the Firstborn, but keeps growing in huge patches until late autumn. Talgana is a truly giant herb that reaches up to 3,5ms in height, a remarkable example of the famously tall forms of Klavek flora. In autumn, the stems can hide a wooly rhino easily. Inside the thickets, the sun and skies are hidden by the broad leaves, and bears’ paths cleave the wall of stems like tunnels. Talgana’s leaves are soft and its stems are easy to move apart with hands or a stick. Its young sprouts are edible, so much so that for bears they are a remedy against hunger in the early summer when there are neither berries nor fish yet. In winter-time, with snow on their umbels, these giants look like exotic trees, and numerous stories for children link them to fairies, but such a link is not proven by sages. They finally cave-in under their white burden when winter takes its course.</p><p>Aside from these endemic plants, this region supports numerous other species of rare flora, particularly grasses, herbs and shrubs. These shrublands are difficult to cross and full of bugs and other insects in summer, but they are a much better place than the neighboring regions for surviving the winter. A lot of wildlife uses them as shelter.</p><h2>Fauna</h2><p>One of the world’s largest herds of moose breeds in the Klavekian Grasslands, and there are three kinds of elk living here, from the smaller normal elks up to the river elk and then onto the megaloceras, but all in all the region is known for its megafauna. Vast herds travel the flatland, most of them following the seasons by going north in spring and south in autumn. They are followed by their predators like the smilodons or ice trolls in most cases, but there are exceptions to the hunting techniques used by creatures such as this, as described in the next paragraph.</p><p>One of the greatest predators in the Grasslands is the addanc, which lives like a beaver and builds dams. When prey tries to cross the water in its territory, it attacks like a crocodile. The various oozes of the region, most notably the grey ooze, the glacial ooze and the white pudding, also tend to be lurking hunters. However, the king of the Grasslands is the one-eyed frostwurm, which even attacks herds of mammoth. It radiates cold, is 35 feet long and weighs 8,000 pounds.</p><p>Other strange hunters include the flightless Ahlinni-birds or the hunting parties of Mimi, the sole fairy of the Grasslands, which have their villages mostly in the nearby forest, but roam the plains for prey. Also on the plains are the fogwarden (spelt the same for singular and plurals), aberrations that look like fog taking a humanoid form. The sight of their ice blue eyes has doomed more than one adventurer who had seen herself as a predator, not prey.</p><p>Maybe the most unusual species for this environment is the Kolasuchus, an amphibian, because it is known for surviving deep freezes, as low as -35 to -40°C. In some cases Kolasuchi have been known to remain frozen in permafrost for years, and after thawing, just walking off.</p><h2>Lake Voltaran</h2><p>One of the few permanent lakes in the Klavekian Grassland is Lake Voltaran, an enormous flooded volcanic caldera where more than a million salmon gather and spawn every year. The water is warm and doesn’t freeze in winter due to volcanic activity or a quasi-dormant gate to the Elemental Plane of Fire, depending on what sage you are listening to. The lake is a lifesaver for many species in the dead of winter, prey or predator, but a hunting ground for very dangerous monsters also. Travelers are wise to avoid it if their lifes don’t depend on its warmth.</p></div>","markdown":""},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"sort":800000,"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}},{"name":"Klavekian Staffweaving","type":"text","_id":"1hMoSKS1OqlchIwq","title":{"show":false,"level":1},"image":{},"text":{"format":1,"content":"<div class=\"aventyr\"><p class=\"s5\">Klavekian Staffweaving</p><h2>The Blank Staffs</h2><p>When confronted with the strange @UUID[JournalEntry.QlctNkzE9injOde9.JournalEntryPage.I4CpK8rTs0HgD7hW]{Vikmordere} magic the traditional wizards of the @UUID[.ulLkhApELbg08M4o]{Klavekian Empire} were at first at a total loss. No one had ever seen such magic as the savage Northmenn could wield. The Vikmordere wouldn’t explain how they did it for obvious reasons and Vikmorere prisoners sooner died then shared tribal secrets. Explorers sent to neighboring lands came back empty handed also.</p><p>Finally, Tarissov the Leprous, Magister of the Klavekian Academie of Magical Arts, came forth with a solution for at least part of the problem. He invented the famous Blank Staffs, magical tools to not only explore foreign magic, but to steal its secrets to a degree. When a spellcaster is hit with a Blank Staff she loses a prepared spell to it. The owner of the Blank Staff can then use the stolen spell. Strangely, when the user of a Blank Staff would be able to cast the stolen spell on its own, the magic vanished, but leaving the Blank Staff rechargeable once more. In the times when the Blank Staff was invented, those magic has not vanished at all, but been transferred to Tarissov the Leprous himself, who in this way became mightier and mightier. Finally, he felt strong enough to challenge the tsar himself, but he overestimated his abilities and was finally slain after what is known as the War Without Faces. Where the magic of a Blank Staffs vanishes now is uncertain, some speculate that Tarissov the Leprous isn’t dead at all, still accumulating power, other say the magic simply dripples away.</p><p>The magic needed to create Blank Staffs went to the grave with Tarissov the Leprous and is lost. But since the traitor-magician wanted the Blank Staffs to be spread wide he produced great amounts of them and sold them cheaply in what was viewed as a patriotic act those days. The Blank Staffs aren’t cheap anymore, but still readily available on the Magical Fair, charged or uncharged. Buyers have to beware though, there are Blank Staffs staffs with magic in them that no one can use, since the user has to be able to understand the magic in the staff on principle. An arcane specialist can’t used a stolen divine spell. The Vikmordere do have something entirely different sometimes, the so called mosaic magic. Only rarely are staffs with mosaic magic useable by any non-Vikmordere in Klavek.</p><h2>Empty Staffs</h2><p>While the magic to create @UUID[.1hMoSKS1OqlchIwq#the-blank-staffs]{Blank Staffs} is lost, the general art of staffbinding has made strides in @UUID[.ulLkhApELbg08M4o]{Klavek}. In these days it is possible to create staffs that are empty in their own ways. The procedure of creating them is expensive and time consuming, but also very flexible. The exact method is a guarded secret of the Klavekian Academie of Magical Arts, but the effect is, when a buyer wants a specific staff, he has to pay an extra amount of money equal 20%, but gets his staff in but 24 hours, for the raw Empty Staff had been prepared in advance. Since other nations still use methods that take a hundred days to produce an individual staff, Klavek’s magicians have a sharp competitive edge in emergencies or with clients not known for their patience. On the other hand, the Magical Fair is known to have most common staffs readily available to buy at normal costs if one spends some time searching, so Empty Staffs would usually be only required for exotic or rare inventions if it was just a matter of speed. With a successful DC 15 Spellcraft check the Empty Staff can be filled with additional magic for the usual fees (and 20%) by a skilled staffweaver, though a failed check makes the Empty Staff unusable for a full moon circle (a month). Empty Staffs are used for Bonded Objects or by wizards who don’t want to use an Efficient Quiver to sort through their magical staffs.</p><h2>Two Staff Weaving</h2><p>Klavekian spellcasters have perfected the art of fighting with staffs since Tarissov the Leprous days. Lukov the Fencer was the first magician to invent the art of Two Wand Weaving, and this feat is still popular in modern Klavek.</p></div>","markdown":""},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"sort":900000,"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}},{"name":"Lineage of Klavekian Tsars","type":"text","_id":"T3yjCTV19TztrWUu","title":{"show":false,"level":1},"image":{},"text":{"format":1,"content":"<div class=\"aventyr\"><p class=\"s5\">Lineage of Klavekian Tsars</p><ul><li><p><strong>About -520-490:</strong> Years of the Angry Sea, the Kraken terrorizes the eastern shores of what is today’s modern @UUID[.ulLkhApELbg08M4o]{Klavek}</p></li><li><p><strong>About -500:</strong> @UUID[.dwAJ5Jtc6ii8zQoh]{Mohkba} founded by Prince Yuri Dvagaslov, the Holy Knight of the Crossroad. @UUID[.LGCNFtJ4cWlq0HjE#divine-quarter]{The Sophianeum }is built in Mohkba, or, by a different account, the city is built where the Sophianeum already stood.

Separated from the other nations by the blasted deserts of the North, and the cliffsides overlooking the ocean to their East, the outside interferences within their growing culture were few and far in between. Developing a spiritual belief system that relies heavily upon the animal spirits around them, as well as the spirits of the moon and sun, and heavily practicing human sacrifice, the N’rcul experienced a true miracle, when, following the passing of a beloved ruler, their leader returned from the grave, restored to life, stronger and filled with the power of the spirits themselves. Kham-a-Tael rose from the grave ignorant of the world outside of his lands, knowing no more of the mysteries of the world then his people, and truly believed that he and only he had been chosen to return from the other side by the spirits, as a sign to his people, a sign that the spirits are listening, and they are watching.</p>\n<p>Kham-a-Tael’s rising sparked a religious fervor within his people, a renewed strength within the nations under his name, and renewed hope for the future of these lands. It was into these lands that a pair of undead were drawn, sensing the power of a newly awakened, and extremely powerful, undead, an unlikely pair of traveling companions (The Vampire Davional, and the @UUID[.mALZCj1Avtm347FY]{Lich Malakittal}). Presenting himself to The Risen Lord within his sleeping chambers, Davional set about establishing nightly visits with the curious undead lord, building a rapport, staying only long enough each night to make sure the interest was there, until the two had gotten familiar enough with each other that the talks got lengthier and lengthier, building to the point that Davional and Malakittal were given rooms within the temples to better accommodate them. It was through these late night conversations that Davional began to educate Kham-a-Tael as to what he believed him to be (a mummy), and several of the abilities demonstrated by Kham-a-Tael supported the theories of the cunning vampire.</p>\n<p>It was within these conversations that Davional laid the seeds for Kham-a-Tael’s mistrust of the outside world, and allowing outsiders to know of the miracle of his rebirth, and in friendship offered to both Davional and his companion Malakittal a permanent place of safety within his lands as well. Davional, realizing the possibility, took the offer a step further, and countered the offer with a safe means of utilizing the resources of the lands to make both his own and Kham-aTael’s people profitable, while guaranteeing that outside influences would be kept at bay. Davional offered to take the edges of NaeraCull for his own people, the Wandering Nation, forming a living buffer between the N’rcul and the outside world, and begin setting up trade with other nations and consortium’s for the natural resources of the rainforest, with the people’s of the wandering nation and the N’rcul supplying the work force, splitting labor between the materials being harvested. Convincing the Risen Lord that it was only a matter of time before a force to large to repel would arrive and begin harvesting resources against their will, it was only logical that they preemptively set up trade relations of their own. All connections were made from Davional’s people, and work began immediately on gathering the Wandering Nation and building them a home to call their own, as well as setting up mining sites, harvesting camps, and farms to utilize local fauna such as the cacao and several other rare herbs.</p>\n<p>Of all the materials available however, the desert offered up the strangest, in the form of raw glass. The deserts of NaeraCull lie within the path of the Scorched Lands, and as such are subjected to temperatures that fuse dunes of sand into glass on a regular basis. Organizing a workforce comprised of constructs, golems and undead all under the watchful eye of a handful of trusted subservient necromancers, Davional has turned the harvesting and export of glass into an extremely lucrative enterprise.</p>\n</div>","markdown":""},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{"core":{"sheetClass":""}}},{"sort":200000,"name":"Malakittal","type":"text","_id":"mALZCj1Avtm347FY","title":{"show":false,"level":1},"image":{},"text":{"format":1,"content":"<div class=\"aventyr\">\n<p class=\"s5\">Malakittal</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center\"><strong>Malakittal, the shadow behind the thrones</strong></p>\n<p> </p>\n<img style=\"float:right;margin:0px 15px 15px 0px;border:0px\" src=\"modules/aaw-games-aventyr/Setting-images/Malekittal-272x300.webp\" width=\"272\" height=\"300\" />\n<p>The Lich who had no desire to be, Malakittal was a cruel and selfish child, gifted with an abnormal intellect amongst his peers, but a complete lack of social grace. Sold into apprenticeship to an older wizard, Malakittal’s father was more than happy to watch his son disappear over the horizon. It was that devalued concept that hardened the heart and soul of the boy who would, within the next year, poison and slay his mentor, and flee into the night with a collection of his tomes. Hiding in the underbelly of a city is an even easier thing to do when you have magical tricks at your disposal to trade with the local guild, and Malakittal soon found himself a means to get by while he studied. At least until the first time he lost control of a spell he was attempting to to cast, and it cost the life of a valued guild member. strung up and disemboweled, left to die, all should have ended in lonely violence for Malakittal, but such was not to be the case.</p>\n<p>Upon piercing the veil, and casting his gaze upon the first realms of death, as his life left his body, terror tore through the young man’s frame, for there was his arcane master, like a rabid dog, at the end of a chain held by a terrifying Demonic being. With the last breaths of life did Malakittal learn that he had interfered with a demonic pact, and had left his former teacher unable to uphold his end of the deal. Seeing no value yet within Malakittal, the Demon trapped his soul, binding it within a crystal prison, and used his foul magics to force lichdom upon what was left of the young man’s body. Sent back amongst the living, a thing of undeath and fear, Malakittal fled the city, and went even further into hiding. Several hundred years passed between that night in that back city alley, and the night everything would change for ever in the “life” of Malakittal. The night he met Davional.</p>\n<p>Davional was merely looking for a place to wait out the passing of a caravan. Transporting several relics from one temple to another, this caravan had enlisted the aid of a full contingent of Templars and a handful of Paladins, seeking to guarantee the safe arrival of their cargo. It was enough of a threat that Davional, a vampire with several generations of age to his name, felt it better to seek a deeper shelter until they had left his lands, rather than risk discovery and be forced to defend himself. It was this need for a deeper tomb that led the two unlikely friends to first meet, the charismatic vampire, and the antisocial lich. Davional, being ever the opportunist, recognized the power within his grasp, and manipulated the lich expertly, taking full advantage of his lack of social grace or experience, to earn the friendship and loyalty of this powerful being hiding from the world.</p>\n<p>Malakittal has been the shadow behind Davional ever since. When Davional relocated his people (the Wandering Nation) to NaeraCull, it was on the promise to Malakittal that the temperate environment would be good for him, and provide more opportunities to learn new arcane secrets. Establishing themselves within a land ripe with the cultural acceptance of human sacrifice has turned out to be of great amusement to Malakittal, as there is never a shortage of souls wishing to “aid” him in his research.</p>\n</div>","markdown":""},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{"core":{"sheetClass":""}}},{"sort":300000,"name":"The Dralman Documents","type":"text","_id":"Cxr0Se9MxlOrH7Ne","title":{"show":false,"level":1},"image":{},"text":{"format":1,"content":"<div class=\"aventyr\"><p class=\"s5\">The Dralman Documents</p><p></p><p>A skald of some renown, Theo Dralman was quested by the Grand University of @UUID[JournalEntry.QVrlu0lTv2vFtT5P.JournalEntryPage.dwAJ5Jtc6ii8zQoh]{Mohkba} to enter the dark jungle and learn all he could of the spirits to which the native people prayed, and how the @UUID[JournalEntry.QVrlu0lTv2vFtT5P]{Klavek Kingdom} could use this information to its own end.

What other species claim to be knowledge is called “<strong>Epatarkka</strong>”, meaning inaccurate, imprecise or unclear.</p>\n<p>Obor is also used to mean “the light that shows the way”, whether literally as “torch” or metaphorically as in “wisdom”.</p>\n<p>Obor is also a reclaimed insult, a derogatory, pejorative, politically inflammatory term. It was slang for animal pen (specifically cattle or sheep) in most lands, many years ago. The giants took the term back when they built the wall around Obor and began their isolationist policies</p>\n<h3>Obri</h3>\n<p><strong>Obri</strong> – meaning “Giants” and the title used by any giant talking to any other creature about giants as an entire species. For many species, Obri<strong> </strong>and Obor<strong> </strong>are interchangeable, despite the differences in meaning.</p>\n<h3>Definicni Obor</h3>\n<p><strong>Definicni Obor</strong> – meaning values that define giants. It is a divine position, one taken by a member of the clerical council. Although clan leaders are usually member of the <strong>@UUID[.bUzRK3wWLJPr3eIJ#obrovsky]{Obrovsky}</strong>, they frequently take advice from the members of this group.</p>\n<h3>Maakarioborkauppias</h3>\n<p><strong>Maakarioborkauppias</strong> – meaning “the makers and sellers of giant goods”; all trades belong to this group. It covers all known Crafts, from the most basic wooden utensils to the most complex of locks and traps, and Professions. Within towns and cities, guilds may exist if 10 or more inhabitants are involved in the same activity, but if asked which group they belong to by someone else, a craftsperson or giant of a particular profession will state, “Maakarioborkauppias.”</p>\n<h3>Maatilaoborllinen</h3>\n<p><strong>Maatilaoborllinen</strong> – meaning “owner of the giant lands” and the title used by those who farm or cultivate the agricultural areas of Obor. It is also the name used by members of the druid circle for its society. Rangers occasionally move between this group and the <strong>@UUID[.bUzRK3wWLJPr3eIJ#obrovsky]{Obrovsky}</strong>.</p>\n<h3>Mezioborovy</h3>\n<p><strong>Mezioborovy</strong> – meaning “across all giantkind”. It is an arcane position, one taken by a member of the wizard amalgamation or sorcerer collective. They frequently live slightly isolated lives as their magic can be unpredictable.</p>\n<h3>Obrovsky</h3>\n<p><strong>Obrovsky</strong> – meaning “of the giants”. It is a military position, usually populated by fighters, paladins and barbarians of all types and alignments, which can cause conflict of a deadly nature. It is by far the largest group of giants in Obor. Rangers occasionally move between this group and the <strong>@UUID[.bUzRK3wWLJPr3eIJ#maatilaoborllinen]{Maatilaoborllinen}</strong>.</p>\n<h3>Viceoborovy</h3>\n<p><strong>Viceoborovy</strong> – meaning “for every giant”. A political position usually associated with specific experts, bards and monks. This group can include clan and realm leaders if they wish, although few chose to except on ceremonial occasions.</p>\n<p>It is not known if there are any other societies or social structures used elsewhere by yet-to-be-encountered giant types.</p>\n<p> </p>\n</div>","markdown":""},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{"core":{"sheetClass":"core.JournalTextTinyMCESheet"}}},{"sort":200000,"name":"Language","type":"text","_id":"YvplRrSOlzeMa3MI","title":{"show":false,"level":1},"image":{},"text":{"format":1,"content":"<div class=\"aventyr\"><p class=\"s5\">Language</p><p>Usually called Votun (or very rarely the archaic version, Vutun, which is often seen in the most ancient of giant texts, such as those held by the @UUID[.0ru8kn3zml6fAvTq#frost]{frost giants}) by those who speak it. Originally it only had one form, but each giant-type has developed a dialect of their own as specific regions of Obor grew. It is perhaps the oldest language that exists amongst mortal creatures, with all other languages containing elements of it in either individual word or common phrases. As a language, it can clearly be traced back to Abyssal, Celestial and Infernal roots and is a primordial language.</p><p>Individual @UUID[.YvplRrSOlzeMa3MI#societies]{societal} and @UUID[.YvplRrSOlzeMa3MI#sub-types]{sub-type} dialects and variations are as follows:</p><h2><span id=\"Societies\">Societies</span></h2><h3>Votunobri</h3><p><strong>Votunobri</strong> – the basic language of all giants. Anyone who can speak this can communicate with any creature that is able to speak “Giant”. When most creatures say they can speak “giant”, this is usually the language they mean. However, in terms of complexity, it is a little like a child talking to an adult and giants often chuckle at the lack of sophistication and understanding of what is being said.</p><h3>Votunmenot</h3><p><strong>Votunmenot</strong> – ceremonial language used by all officials, but particularly the <strong>@UUID[.bUzRK3wWLJPr3eIJ#viceoborovy]{Viceoborovy}</strong>. Complex and enormously descriptive at times, it is punctuated by individual words which sum up what may have just taken 20 minutes to describe. It has a great deal in common with the language spoken by treants, which is another language which can be traced back to primordial times.</p><h3>Votunmyymme</h3><p><strong>Votunmyymme</strong> – the trade dialect of the <strong>@UUID[.bUzRK3wWLJPr3eIJ#maakarioborkauppias]{Maakarioborkauppias}</strong>, indicating that the giant itself, or an item made by the giant, is for sale. The dialect consistently suggests “we sell” as a group rather than individualizing any particular activity, reflecting the belief that all crafts and professions rely on each other to be successful.</p><h3>Votunruoka</h3><p><strong>Votunruoka</strong> – the group dialect of the <strong>@UUID[.bUzRK3wWLJPr3eIJ#maatilaoborllinen]{Maatilaoborllinen}</strong>, indicating that the group feeds giantkind, both in terms of providing raw food and cooked meals. It is another basic dialect that leaves little room for misunderstanding or use elsewhere. Giant druids use a form of this dialect.</p><h3>Votunsota</h3><p><strong>Votunsota </strong>–<strong> </strong>language used by the <strong>@UUID[.bUzRK3wWLJPr3eIJ#obrovsky]{Obrovsky}</strong>, full of martial phrases and strident exclamations as well as sections dealing specifically with might, power, arms and armor and battle tactics. It is a relatively straightforward language that can be used without confusion on a battlefield and doesn’t suffer from a possible misunderstanding in meaning when passed along a chain of command. It is at all times a practical and effective dialect.</p><h3>Votuntaika</h3><p><strong>Votuntaika</strong> – language used by the <strong>@UUID[.bUzRK3wWLJPr3eIJ#mezioborovy]{Mezioborovy}</strong>. Full or mysterious and arcane phrasing, it has elements of Draconic entwined within it. There are a number of mythical and legendary words of power within <strong>@UUID[.YvplRrSOlzeMa3MI#votuntaika]{Votuntaika}</strong> which act like metamagic feats when sufficiently understood and practiced, although these seem to only work for giants able to wield arcane power of some significance.</p><h3>Votunuskonto</h3><p><strong>@UUID[.YvplRrSOlzeMa3MI#votunuskonto]{Votunuskonto}</strong> – language used by the <strong>@UUID[.bUzRK3wWLJPr3eIJ#definicni-obor]{Definicni Obor}</strong>. As the language of religion, philosophy and guidance, it has to be clear and exact at all times. All texts and statements which deal with matters of the gods and the ways of giant life are now all recorded in <strong>@UUID[.YvplRrSOlzeMa3MI#votunuskonto]{Votunuskonto}</strong>, as well as the language they were originally received in. This has made the language a powerful tool in dictating the path the giants will take, as it links together the dictates of the gods over time.</p><h2><span id=\"Sub-types\">Sub-types</span></h2><h3><strong>Votunjatti</strong></h3><p><strong>Votunjatti</strong> – spoken by the @UUID[.0ru8kn3zml6fAvTq#athach]{Athach}. Whilst it is recognized by all Obri that athachs are actually aberrations, they are considered the Children of the Gods (see @UUID[.0ru8kn3zml6fAvTq#athach]{athach entry}). <strong>Votunjatti</strong> is even more simplistic than <strong>@UUID[.YvplRrSOlzeMa3MI#votunobri]{Votunobri}</strong>, a straightforward version that athachs have slipped into over the millennia. Some sages moot that it is in fact the gods’ original attempt at a language for a mortal creature (and that athachs are the first attempt at giants), an idea that is closely studied and debated.</p><h3><strong>Votunpilvi</strong></h3><p><strong>Votunpilvi</strong> – spoken by the @UUID[.0ru8kn3zml6fAvTq#cloud]{Cloud giants}. Although these giants have universally deep voices, the tone and flow of their dialect ranges between dark and brooding all the way to high and wispy, just as clouds themselves. Occasionally used by bards for songs and tales of attempts to take hold of the unobtainable.</p><h3><strong>Votuntupla</strong></h3><p><strong>Votuntupla</strong> – spoken by the @UUID[.0ru8kn3zml6fAvTq#ettin]{Ettins}. It is an odd dialect, one that is made up of repetition, double explanation or statement and sometimes cross purpose, particularly when arguments are taking place. It is (correctly) thought that the two heads of an ettin can each only speak part of their overall language capability and that if an ettin was to lose one head yet survive, they would find it very hard to communicate verbally.</p><h3><strong>Votunpalo</strong></h3><p><strong>Votunpalo</strong> – spoken by the @UUID[.0ru8kn3zml6fAvTq#fire]{Fire giants}, the dialect is, naturally, a fiery one, fully of inflammatory delivery and passionate appeals. It is a dialect that lends itself most easily to arguments and energetic activity. Many giants who wish to motivate those around them who make things include a smattering of this dialect.</p><h3><strong>Votunkuura/Votunhuurre</strong></h3><p><strong>Votunkuura/Votunhuurre </strong>– spoken by the @UUID[.0ru8kn3zml6fAvTq#frost]{Frost giants}, <strong>Votunkuura</strong> is a dialect with a significant number of clicking and cracking sounds in addition to actual words. <strong>Vutunhuurre</strong> is a little more delicate and is most frequently used to describe the lands within 100 miles of a frost giant’s home, particularly when discussing details of the natural environment.</p><h3><strong>Votunkunnas</strong></h3><p><strong>Votunkunnas </strong>– spoken by the @UUID[.0ru8kn3zml6fAvTq#hill]{Hill giants}. Like the hills themselves, the dialect is one that rolls, with noticeable peaks and troughs in delivery. It has a range of words to describe fertile land and is sometimes used by those in the druid circle to get complex points across to those knowledgeable about giants.</p><h3><strong>Votunmakeanveden</strong></h3><p><strong>Votunmakeanveden </strong>–<strong> </strong>spoken by the @UUID[.0ru8kn3zml6fAvTq#merrow]{Merrow}. It is a guttural dialect, full of liquid sounds and use of air bubbles in the throat. Not an easy dialect to get to grips with for those who do not speak Aquan.</p><h3><strong>Votunkaaos</strong></h3><p><strong>Votunkaaos </strong>– spoken by the @UUID[.0ru8kn3zml6fAvTq#ogres]{Ogres}. A highly-changeable, ever-adapting dialect that readily picks up words and phrases from other languages and, if spoken for relatively short periods in lands where other humanoids dwell, will morph into a good approximation of that land’s natives’ language.</p><h3><strong>Votunkivi</strong></h3><p><strong>Votunkivi </strong>– spoken by the @UUID[.0ru8kn3zml6fAvTq#stone]{Stone giants}, full of rumbles and grinding notes. Elders use a variation called <strong>Votunjalokivi</strong> when communing with the earth. Although it has close links to Terran, there are no recorded cases of non-stone giant elders being able to speak the dialect.</p><h3><strong>Votunmyrsky</strong></h3><p><strong>Votunmyrsky </strong>– spoken by the @UUID[.0ru8kn3zml6fAvTq#storm]{Storm giants}, it is an all-or-nothing dialect, sounding either at complete calm or alarmingly strident, even when being used, for example, to tell jokes.</p><h3><strong>Votunparantaa</strong></h3><p><strong>Votunparantaa </strong>– spoken by the @UUID[.0ru8kn3zml6fAvTq#trolls]{Trolls}, it is a dialect which can talk endlessly about any topic, given the chance. It folds back in on itself and develops and grows in a seemingly unstoppable way.</p><h3><strong>Votunalamaailma</strong></h3><p><strong>Votunalamaailma </strong>– spoken by the @UUID[.0ru8kn3zml6fAvTq#underworld]{underworld giants}, this dialect is frequently more easily used and understood by Underworld dwellers than other giants when first encountered. If listened to for a week, it becomes clear that it contains much that any other giant does actually understand but is a dark and shadowy version of Votun.</p><p>It is not known if there are any other languages or dialects used elsewhere by yet-to-be-encountered giant types. However, giant language and dialect is so heavily influenced by the land within which users live, particularly in delivery, that if giants do live in swamps, deserts or jungles, then it is more than likely that their dialect will have many components strongly influenced by those natural surroundings, such as the soft, shifting sounds of moving desert sands or dripping, lush noises of a tropical jungle.</p><p> </p></div>","markdown":""},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{"core":{"sheetClass":"core.JournalTextPageSheet"}}},{"sort":300000,"name":"Religion","type":"text","_id":"eSZclzdgw0E9gdK6","title":{"show":false,"level":1},"image":{},"text":{"format":1,"content":"<div class=\"aventyr\"><p class=\"s5\">Religion</p><p>The basis of all giant religion is called Vodoun.

Each aspect has good and bad points and is considered in positive and negative ways at different times for different reasons.</p><p>Of the thirteen children, twelve are still worshipped today. Each child, all also androgynous beings, now represents one of the twelve remaining giant types that live in Obor. Each giant type is loyal to their patron Apulainen, but gives praise and collection to Pappi and Salainen on appropriate days as well as to the lesser Apulainen of the society, clan and tribe they belong to, and to their own family spirits.</p><p>The thirteenth Apulainen represented the titans, who left Obor to travel the planes many millennia ago. They are no longer considered to be part of giantkind and are rarely referred to. It is considered to be extremely rude to talk of titans with any giant.</p><p>All creation is considered both divine and arcane, and therefore everything contains the power of both of these forces. This is how medicines such as herbal remedies are understood, and explains the casual use of mundane objects in religious ritual. Vodoun talismans, called “fetishes”, are objects such as statues, dried animal parts or manufactured items that are used for their healing and spiritually rejuvenating properties.</p><p>The @UUID[.bUzRK3wWLJPr3eIJ#definicni-obor]{Definicni Obor} and @UUID[.bUzRK3wWLJPr3eIJ#mezioborovy]{Mezioborovy }are entrusted to cast spells on or at enemies on behalf of supplicants, either calling upon vodoun spirits to bring misfortune or harm to a person or group or/and benefit to the supplicant. Sacrifice is a common way to show respect and thankfulness to the gods, usually consisting of something that has taken time, effort and energy to personally produce. Value is of secondary importance to these three factors.</p><p>Pappi and Salainen’s youngest child, @UUID[.eSZclzdgw0E9gdK6#ogres-–-kuopus]{Kuopus}, remains to this day in Obor and acts as a go-between with their other children; it is the principal Apulainen of the @UUID[.0ru8kn3zml6fAvTq#ogres]{ogres} and appears as either a young and virile female when something needs to be done urgently or takes the form of an old man when something needs to be learned and time is available.</p><p>The other chief Apulainen are listed below. After these principal Apulainen, there comes an entire range of lesser and least spirits. The most visible and easily recognised of these is Airut, a messenger spirit who relays messages between the giant world and the world of the Apulainen. It almost always takes the form of a dark, squat giant with a large bag over its shoulder and a pipe in its mouth. As the mediator between the gods and the living Airut maintains balance, order, peace and communication. Airut’s Pipe is able to cast spells and act as a weapon as it can transform into a two-handed hammer as a free action.</p><p>The principal Apulainen of the twelve giant types in Obor are listed below. Each can appear as a male or female as it chooses, or in its natural androgynous form. Each change is usually a free action that doesn’t provoke an attack of opportunity if undertaken in a situation where it is threatened.</p><p>The forms come complete with any clothing, armour and equipment the Apulainen choose to be wearing and carrying at that point. No item worn by an Apulainen remains if it chooses to leave Obor or if it is dismissed or banished. However, it is able to bring specific items to give to giants for a purpose.</p><p></p><h2>The Apulainen</h2><h3>Athach – Ennen</h3><p>Ennen appears as a five-limbed creature that chooses whichever configuration of limbs is most beneficial at that moment in time. It can change up to three limbs as a free action, but changing four or five is a move equivalent action. Although it mostly appears as either a male or female @UUID[.0ru8kn3zml6fAvTq#athach]{athach}, it can also appear as any four-legged beast that resides in Obor but have an arm sprouting from the middle of its back. Alternatively Ennen will walk amongst the athach as a rogue that is particularly dexterous, and attempt to get them to think about solutions to problems that don’t always involve brute strength.</p><h3>Cloud – Ylla</h3><p>Ylla will appear amongst the @UUID[.0ru8kn3zml6fAvTq#cloud]{cloud giants} as a male hunter with huskies or a female bard telling tales of lost souls. In both cases the form is neither particularly striking nor overly plain; it is in its actions that Ylla makes its point. It will also appear as a spectacular display of lenticular clouds over important events, either causing fear in the enemy or providing cover for attackers if required. Ylla will sometimes be found in the company of @UUID[.eSZclzdgw0E9gdK6#storm-–-salama]{Salama}, particularly when the latter is in dragon form, in a cloud form that confounds Salama’s abilities, allow each of them to hone their skills.</p><h3>Ettin – Kaksois</h3><p>Kaksois can appear as a martial-looking male or female @UUID[.0ru8kn3zml6fAvTq#ettin]{ettin} when it wishes to walk amongst its children. It can also appear as twins that are barely distinguishable from their faces but are clearly one male and one female if viewed in their entirety. The ettin forms are experienced and at their prime, whilst the twins are youngsters looking to gain help from the ettins and are a test of their tolerance and wisdom. Kaksois will occasionally appear as a sage, able to see both sides of an issue, and will mediate on a disagreement that hinders progress, whether of an individual ettin or the whole race.</p><h3>Fire – Hotkia</h3><p>Hotkia will appear as a burning fire giant to its followers, either a female cleric or male “paladin”, both of which will look to lead the @UUID[.0ru8kn3zml6fAvTq#fire]{fire giants} it has visited to greater glory. Hotkia will also appear as ceremonial fire at events where such is in place, which is just about every event you can think of that involves fire giants. The flames will be the purest red that any fire giant has seen, with the heat being a cleansing rather than damaging experience.</p><h3>Frost – Valkoinen</h3><p>Valkoinen chooses to appear either as a female ranger out to accompany those who face peril alone or as a monk accompanying travellers and asking them to test themselves as a group, perhaps to complete tasks they never imagined they would face. Valkoinen will also appear as snow fall where every flake is the same or as a layer of frost where every crystal is identical. In either case, it takes a cleric of Valkoinen 2d6 rounds to spot this, a follower [[/roll 2d4]] minutes and anyone with knowledge of giants [[/roll 5d6]] minutes. Once the snow or frost has finished falling ([[/roll 3d2]] hours), it will rise up into Valkoinen’s androgynous form and consider answering requests.</p><h3>Hill – Lehti</h3><p>Lehti appears either as a druid or as a barbarian, male or female. In any of these forms, Lehti is quite young, and always younger than the @UUID[.0ru8kn3zml6fAvTq#hill]{hill giant} it is appearing before. It will often offer to act as a helper for an individual hill giant going about an important or necessary task, slowly showing a more effective or efficient way of completing that task. Only when the task is complete and the hill giant concerned has thanked its new young friend will Lehti reveal itself in its true form, a cross between a hill giant and a treant, although much more like the former.</p><h3>Merrow – Jokijarvi</h3><p>Jokijarvi tends to present an appearance that is overwhelming: as a colossal elder water elemental, engulfing island-size patch of sentient seaweed, or a colossal kraken. It is even said that the great lake serpents are a taken form. At other times, Jokijarvi will walk amongst the @UUID[.0ru8kn3zml6fAvTq#merrow]{merrow} as a cleric, or very occasionally sorcerer. The merrow aren’t known for their spell casting ability, and every now and then Jokijarvi will conduct an “enlightenment drive” to ensure knowledge is spread by more merrow than shamen and tribal elders. These drives involve finding up to a dozen young merrow and providing the “Mark of All Merrow,” a birthmark that actually taps into innate spell casting ability and brings it forth.</p><h3>Ogres – Kuopus</h3><p>Kuopus is generally happy to let the image of @UUID[.0ru8kn3zml6fAvTq#ogres]{ogres} as crude boors ride, because it means they have to learn to stand on their own two feet and be rewarded by a distinct place in the world. Taking the typical barbarian form of the ogres, Kuopus encourages robust tournaments designed to let the cream of the ogres rise to the top, even as the god appears as an old man. But at other times, Kuopus walks amongst the ogres as the most charming and eloquent of their type, encouraging a self-expression that is usually held in almost brutal check. Often female, but not exclusively, Kuopus appears as a bard or story-telling illusionist, and revels that the ogres throw themselves whole-heartedly into can last for weeks. These revels encourage the often down-trodden ogres to face a world that despises them with renewed vigour. Kuopus is also the go-between for the other gods.</p><h3>Stone – Paasi</h3><p>The @UUID[.0ru8kn3zml6fAvTq#stone]{stone giant} people rarely see Passi, but they know their god is amongst them at all times. Passi IS stone, and has adopted the stone giants because of their affinity with the material, and is present as the mountains and lands the giants live on, work with, and use as tools, homes and weapons. If Passi does appear in a clearly recognisable form, it is as a travelling elder at a moot, or as an expert in some problem, stepping in to advise and guide, but never tell, a stone giant council or individual how to move on from an issue OR not make a mistake through a particular curse of action. Occasionally Passi will take the form of an ideal earth elemental from the dreams of stone giant children, although this is really just a slight variation in Passi’s usual form of stone itself.</p><h3>Storm – Salama</h3><p>Salama is a slightly contrary god, usually appearing as the opposite of the @UUID[.0ru8kn3zml6fAvTq#storm]{storm giant} who receives a visit. A heavily-armed fighter will see Salama as a robed monk, a wandering ranger sees a desk-bound mage or sage, an aristocrat sees a commoner, males see a female, and so on. Salama enjoys changing perception as much as the weather, and will present a form that encourages introspection and then release of hidden talents and unexpected innate abilities. If angry, Salama appears as a force dragon of a size sufficient to frighten whoever is the annoyance into an apology; all storm giant tales relate that Salama has never killed anyone or anything in this form, preferring to humiliate them and leave them bereft of all belongings and dignity. However, those tales also say that if Salama does kill someone when in dragon form, it will herald the end of the world. Salama is sometimes found with Ylla, who provides a worthy sparring partner for Salama’s force dragon form.</p><h3>Trolls – Oliivi</h3><p>Oliivi was once a simple @UUID[.0ru8kn3zml6fAvTq#trolls]{troll}, just like those walk Obor to this day. The difference between Oliivi and the trolls that came before is that the now-god found a way to channel the chaos and evil that trolls live by into unifying forces. Oliivi is actually responsible for introducing the isolationist views that all giants now hold, encouraging trolls to use their chaotic ways to promote troll clans over all others, and their evil approach to ensure troll elite were able to come out on top in any situation. Today, Oliivi will appear amongst the trolls as a ranger or druid of either sex, often when a tribe has fallen to ways that are too chaotic or too evil; after appearing out of seemingly nowhere, Oliivi will once again show that the way for trolls to succeed is to channel their natural instincts outwards onto others, not onto each other. This is a never-ending task</p><h3>Underworld – Maan–Uumenissa</h3><p>Little is known about Maan-Uumenissa, even by the @UUID[.0ru8kn3zml6fAvTq#underworld]{underworld giants} themselves. Stories say that the god bears the weight of the entire world at all times, and that providing places for the underworld giants to live and thrive is enough to give thanks for. Maan-Uumenissa is actually currently in torpor; when the world was struck by the “Shard of the Sun”, the carnage it caused (such as the Scarred Lands) struck the god deeply, and now Maan-Uumenissa rests to heal wounds that have damaged an entire planet. The god does visit the underworld giants on very rare occasions, usually as the ghost a mage who concentrates on spells associated with stone and force, or as the spirit of an expert stone mason able to carve a place to live from the solid mass of the Underworld. It is rumoured some @UUID[JournalEntry.QlctNkzE9injOde9.JournalEntryPage.t4LZuyNruvzneOHD]{deep dwarves} also worship Maan–Uumenissa, tapping into the god’s ability to work with stone to create particularly spiritual places far below the surface of Obor. If an alliance of these dwarves and giants ever occurs, other races will almost certainly find themselves out of a home.</p><p></p></div>","markdown":""},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}},{"sort":400000,"name":"Race History","type":"text","_id":"0ru8kn3zml6fAvTq","title":{"show":false,"level":1},"image":{},"text":{"format":1,"content":"<div class=\"aventyr\"><p class=\"s5\">Race History</p><h2>Athach</h2><p>Athach – The athach people came about as a result of <em>Pappi</em> and <em>Salainen</em> gathering together all the children of the other giant races that didn’t quite match the ideal they had in mind for them. They saw the advantage of a race that confounded belief, both within Obor and without, and ensured the newly-named athach race survived and, in its own way, flourished, with <em>@UUID[.eSZclzdgw0E9gdK6#athach-–-ennen]{Ennen}</em> charged to watch over it. To this day, the athach view themselves as special and chosen, but this knowledge is often enough to drive them to the brink of madness.</p><p><strong>Leader: </strong>Kolme Kadet - 5th level bard, 5th level fighter (Cha 13)</p><h2>Cloud</h2><p>Cloud – The cloud giants came into being from the very air, as <em>@UUID[.eSZclzdgw0E9gdK6#cloud-–-ylla]{Ylla}</em>, drew air, earth, fire and water together and moulded them into the clouds. To this day, cloud giants are able to show how each of the four elements are part of their “whole”, and explain why this sum is greater than the individual elemental parts. At their death, the most venerated cloud giants are afforded a ceremony which ensures their bodies are returned to the four elements in equal parts, so they can influence the very being of future members of the race.</p><p><strong>Leader: </strong>Tupruta Kevyt 12th level cleric</p><h2>Ettin</h2><p>Ettin – Ettin tales relate that when they were created, their maker <em>@UUID[.eSZclzdgw0E9gdK6#ettin-–-kaksois]{Kaksois }</em>had so much for them to say and do that two heads were necessary in order to achieve all that was required of them. Unfortunately, <em>Kaksois</em> failed to give any indication which head was in charge and so discord is as frequent a visitor as harmony. It is also said that if the two heads of a single ettin ever achieve complete agreement on every matter for the duration of a full moon, ettins everywhere will rise to lead the Obri nation in a wise and benevolent way.</p><p><strong>Leader: </strong>Kaksikko Paa 13th level fighter</p><h2>Fire</h2><p>Fire – Fire giants originally consisted of outcasts from all other societies, hotheads and rabble-rousers who drove others to despair before finding themselves permanently banished in order to save everyone else’s sanity. Many retreated from the land that was known, taking to the depths and lost places away from the hills and mountains that giants were used to living in. <em>@UUID[.eSZclzdgw0E9gdK6#fire-–-hotkia]{Hotkia}</em> is talked of as if the god actually walked amongst the earliest outcasts, leading them to the fiery rifts and heights that others ignored. These travels took the nomads to <em>Aitotulivuori</em>, the largest, most internally-active volcano in Obor. From here the fire giant tribes and clans grew, descending deep into the earth at the same time. Eventually a rift to the Elemental Plane of Fire was discovered, and the identity of the fire giants properly established.</p><p><strong>Leader: </strong>Palo Halko 6th level expert, 6th level warrior</p><h2>Frost</h2><p>Frost – The frost giants hold that they were the first giants, when <em>Pappi</em> and <em>Salainen</em> took it upon themselves to count the flakes of snow that fell on the ring of mountains far to the north of what is now Obor. As they landed, each became a giant; the first of these were the frost giants, who took their place at the top of the mountains. Others that followed became the other races and moved elsewhere to live their live, making the frost giants the pre-eminent members of their species. At least that is what the frost giants say, and who’s to doubt them. Their artefacts are clearly older than those of any other race, whilst <em>@UUID[.YvplRrSOlzeMa3MI#votunkuura/votunhuurre]{vutunhuurre }</em>has no direct link with any other Obri language, other than <em>@UUID[.YvplRrSOlzeMa3MI#votunkuura/votunhuurre]{votunkuura}</em>. Elderly frost giants are also known to occasionally hibernate, something no other giant-type does.</p><p><strong>Leader: </strong>Routainen Tanner 10th level sorcerer (Cha 18)</p><p></p><h2>Hill</h2><p>Hill – Hill giants took their place amongst the other races when no other giant wanted to live on the “lowlands”. Instead, those who found themselves at the bottom of their own hierarchy move away and banded together on the low peaks and wooded slopes of the Obor hills, becoming their own people. Although this life was difficult, without any of the massive majesty other giant environs offer, <em>@UUID[.eSZclzdgw0E9gdK6#hill-–-lehti]{Lehti }</em>show this new clan how to make the most of their new life and home, things which the hills giants still guard with jealousy, even as many secretly wish they could trace their heritage and return to an original home.</p><p><strong>Leader: </strong>Alava Kumpu 12th level paladin (Wis 14, Cha 12)</p><h2>Merrow</h2><p>Merrow – Although only the most senior clerics or deep-in-trance sorcerers of their will admit it, the original merrow were giants driven from the Obor lands for acting in the worst interests of all Obri. The exact nature of their actions is unclear, but the guidelines of the <em>@UUID[.bUzRK3wWLJPr3eIJ#definicni-obor]{Definicni Obor }</em>make a number of statements that refer to the “outcasts beyond our shores”. To the uninitiated, this seems to simply mean non-giants; internally, it refers to the merrow. <em>@UUID[.eSZclzdgw0E9gdK6#merrow-–-jokijarvi]{Jokijarvi }</em>took up their cause at the request of <em>Pappi</em> and <em>Salainen</em>, who ultimately want all giants to live together, yet know that those who don’t think of the Obri first and foremost need to pay a price. This price is being cursed to ultimately have to live in water, with only short periods on dry land.</p><p>Saltwater merrow are thought to exist, but are very rare if they do.</p><p><strong>Leader: </strong>Vesi Pesa 14th level druid</p><p></p><h2>Ogres</h2><p>Ogres – <em>@UUID[.eSZclzdgw0E9gdK6#ogres-–-kuopus]{Kuopus’s}</em> ogres have always been viewed by other giants as the children of <em>Pappi</em> and <em>Salainen</em>; they are usually loud, vulgar, and act in an out-of-control manner should they pick up barbarian tendencies. But they have also always been the link between the Obri and the outside world. The elves first realised this and gave the giants a number of islands of their eastern coast, where a part-elf-part ogre race developed and flourished, in order for the Obri to present skilled diplomats to the rest of the inhabitants of the planet. To this day, the agreed representative of all the giants is a member of this race, and has been for as long as giants can remember. As the go-between between his parents and the other <em>apulainen,</em> <em>Kuopus </em>knows what it is like to be an emissary,<em> </em>and ensures the chosen <em>elgres</em> do the very best job they can at all times.</p><p><strong>Leader: </strong>Rumilus Hirmu 13th level barbarian</p><h2>Stone</h2><p>Stone – As <em>Pappi</em> and <em>Salainen</em> created the frost giants, <em>@UUID[.eSZclzdgw0E9gdK6#stone-–-paasi]{Passi }</em>sat on a rock and watched. Eventually the ground froze, and then cracked, as the cold seeped into it. From the shards of rock that were created when these cracks occurred, the first stone giants were formed. They were charged with protecting the ground that made up Obor from the frost giants, offering other giant types a chance to find a place to call home. As caretakers of the land, stone giants take their duties very seriously, and will engage with another creature only until it promises to stop harming the land. Then will turn from foe to friend in a moment, help heal the individuals concerned, and send them on their way.</p><p>The stone giants also built the wall that surrounds Obor; along with gnome engineers, the wall was created within a month, with time to spare to have giants everywhere test it by hurling rocks at it. To this day, it has survived any and all assaults.</p><p><strong>Leader: </strong>Jalo Marmori 11th level rogue (Dex 17)</p><h2>Storm</h2><p>Storm – The contrary nature of <em>@UUID[.eSZclzdgw0E9gdK6#storm-–-salama]{Salama}</em> is what drove storm giants to leave the land and take to the air. However, <em>Salama</em> couldn’t quite leave the land behind, and granted storm giants to ability to raise up huge flying citadels that float as might the lightest feather. To this day, tales of aggrieved storm giants uprooting villages and small towns to either save them or punish them occur in equal measure. Storm giants are also called on when drought has occurred as they can, for the right price, ensure enough rain falls to satisfy even the most water-starved area.</p><p>Storm giants have also traditionally overseen the flying fortress that holds a sliver of the “Shard of the Sun” in a highly-protected sphere that is used to power a particularly effective weather machine. This particular task has fallen to one family for many years now, as is a task that is undertaken with complete seriousness.</p><p><strong>Leader: </strong>Alykas Kipina 14th level wizard (Int 17)</p><h2>Trolls</h2><p>Trolls – Any troll will tell you that they spontaneously stepped from the ground the moment <em>@UUID[.eSZclzdgw0E9gdK6#trolls-–-oliivi]{Oliivi} </em>decided that it should be so, and that they will never leave the land until <em>Pappi</em> and <em>Salainen</em> ask them to go. This means not only the troll species as a whole, but also the individuals that make up its number, particularly those that are able to spur the troll nation to bigger and better rewards. Within the giant lands, trolls tend to keep to themselves, fitting in with all the other giant types almost unnoticed. However, when decisions are to be made, senior trolls appear seemingly out of thin air to voice their strongly isolationist views. The other side of this is that they make better-suited individuals for certain professions, and can be trusted to the very end once a deal has been struck (unless another troll is involved).</p><p><strong>Leader: </strong>Kasvaa Paluu 7th Level ranger, 6th level druid</p><h2>Underworld</h2><p>Underworld – As with <em>@UUID[.eSZclzdgw0E9gdK6#underworld-–-maan–uumenissa]{Maan–Uumenissa}</em>, little is known about the history of the underworld giants, more because it is shrouded in mystery rather than individuals not knowing. Nothing is clear about why the original members retreated to the depths, or how they managed to establish themselves once they were there. In fact, the first few giants to retreat into the Underworld were a band who could not decide which of the other <em>apulainen</em> to follow, so left the surface of Obor to follow another path. <em>Maan-Uumenissa</em> found them wandering in despair, and vowed to support them forever onwards, even though the weight of the world was on the god’s shoulders. Since then, Underworld giants have slowly adapted to their home, and are now experts at getting the most from the cold, hard rock around them.</p><p><strong>Leader: </strong>Alempi Kamara 9th level monk (Dex 14, Wis 14)</p></div>","markdown":""},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{"core":{"sheetClass":"core.JournalTextPageSheet"}}},{"sort":500000,"name":"Regions","type":"text","_id":"DGCq9pB33FlnM4rY","title":{"show":false,"level":1},"image":{},"text":{"format":1,"content":"<div class=\"aventyr\"><p class=\"s5\">Regions</p><h2>Ydin-koto</h2><p>The north coast that runs along the side of the @UUID[JournalEntry.QVrlu0lTv2vFtT5P]{Klavek Kingdom} is known as Ydin-koto (Original Home). It is a narrow range of massively tall mountains, some of which are built into the wall surrounding Obor. It is the home of the @UUID[.0ru8kn3zml6fAvTq#frost]{frost giants}, along with many @UUID[.0ru8kn3zml6fAvTq#cloud]{cloud giants} and some storm giants. Links to the Elemental Planes of Air and Earth can be found here, although none are permanent. A continuous storm, roughly 10 miles across, follows a circular path that is about 1,500 miles in circumference, travelling at between 15 and 20 miles a day. Much of this storm is out at sea, but it works its way along the coast for about six or seven days of every 86 day cycle</p><h2>Aitotulivuori</h2><p>The home of the @UUID[.0ru8kn3zml6fAvTq#fire]{fire giants} is Aitotulivuori, which is about three miles high and surrounded by the taller, frozen mountains. It is also situated to the north of Obor, and is considered part of @UUID[.DGCq9pB33FlnM4rY#ydin-koto]{Ydin-koto} by non-giants. There are a number of deep rifts around the base of the volcano, at least two of which descend around nine miles underground. At this depth, a permanent link to the Elemental Plane of Fire can be found, although very few creatures, including the fire giants themselves, ever make it there. Any that are encountered are usually extraplanar visitors, with many coming to or going from a summoning, having completed their part of a bargain or spell; almost all are seen leaving with payments of some kind, sometimes in kind.</p><h2>Ylä–mäki</h2><p>Ylä–mäki which sits in the bay at the top of mainland Obor, is the greatest peak in the country, standing at roughly 13 miles high. Deep within it are the entranceways to the Underworld and giants that make their home there. At its summit, a @UUID[.0ru8kn3zml6fAvTq#frost]{frost giant} observatory sits, watching the skies for the celestial conjunction that will signal ”The Beginning of the End”. This is either a time when all people will come together to live harmoniously, or is the first in a series of cataclysmic events that will trigger the implosion of Obor and its neighbouring lands. Unfortunately, the frost giants aren’t certain which it is that is going to happen. Outside of Obor, it is known as ”High Tor”.</p><h2>Keha and Kaari</h2><p>Off the northern shore are Keha and Kaari (the Ring and the Arc). These islands were formed when debris from the falling ”Shard of the Sun” landed and caused the seabed to rise up above the level of the surface in some places. The islands are often used by @UUID[.0ru8kn3zml6fAvTq#merrow]{merrow} as resting places if, for example, storms become too rough, or they are meeting non-giants for, for example, trading purposes. The islands are riddled with caves and narrow inlets, making currents around them treacherous. Giant pirates operate from here. The islands are also rather gem-rich, as the heat from their creation caused much of the raised seabed to turn to gems, but getting them is difficult.</p><h2>Taivas Tasanko</h2><p>There is a huge mesa plateau, Taivas Tasanko, on a disputed bulge of land that is almost surrounded by Klavek, roughly in the middle of that country’s southern border. The mesa is over three miles high and just about 400 miles in circumference, taking up the whole of the ”bulge”. The wall enclosing Obor is even built around the base of the mesa, to ensure continuity. This is where Pappi and Salainen first stepped on the planet, and is still the first stepping stone for all the apulainen when they visit. On the top of the plateau is a martial monastery and place of worship, Luostari. Every giant race is represented here, although it is not an “equal” place; for example, currently the @UUID[.0ru8kn3zml6fAvTq#athach]{athachs} are camped on the roof, whilst the @UUID[.0ru8kn3zml6fAvTq#merrow]{merrow} have to change their representatives every few days due to the lack of water.</p><h2>Raja Linnoitus</h2><p>The entire southern sea border of Obor is one huge military and governmental administrative building called Raja Linnoitus. This building, built entire for giant-sized occupants, is where anyone visiting Obor is officially allowed to enter. Anyone found in the country without the required paperwork issued from this place has just one chance to be taken into custodial care or will be executed on the spot. The giants are very particular about this. Only two groups – all @UUID[JournalEntry.QlctNkzE9injOde9.JournalEntryPage.lMtTJxWecu1ISdP0]{gnomes} from @UUID[JournalEntry.2cK9lISUylZwk24i]{Pradjna}, and @UUID[JournalEntry.QlctNkzE9injOde9.JournalEntryPage.ei36LjIhEoh87vgE]{elves} who are residents of the Elgres islands – are exempt.</p><h2>The southern border</h2><p>The southern border with the Scorched Lands, and western borders with the unclaimed territories and Pradjna, all have a series of airboat platforms every 50 miles along the protective wall. These towers are roughly half a mile high, with the only landing platform at the top and just one exit at the base. When the Pradjna gnomes helped the giants build the defensive wall around the whole country, the giants gave the gnomes the details of how to make the flying citadels that storm giants use. The gnomes developed airboats for both themselves and the giants, and requested that safe stations be placed on the joint border. These airboats are prized items, in particular those built for giants, and are defended at all costs. Any non-giant or non-gnome in possession of one will find that they receive constant requests to sell it, often for overly-large sums. Neither the giants nor the gnomes like them falling into the hands of other races.</p><h2>Kadotettu</h2><p>Off the coast of the Vast Swamp, towards its northern border with the Scorched Lands, Obor has ownership of an island, Kadotettu, which is the place where the titans left for other realms. It is unclear whether the loss of the titans from the giant population is considered a good or bad state of affairs; the titans were insisting on being allowed a stronger influence over the entire giant population just before their departure, a situation that was causing internal rifts throughout the rest of the @UUID[.bUzRK3wWLJPr3eIJ#obri]{Obri}. Eventually the titans’ request was refused and they left, which brought about a return to internal stability and a golden age when the rest of giantkind took significant strides forward. Kadotettu is now inhabited by a force of @UUID[.0ru8kn3zml6fAvTq#trolls]{trolls}, land-based and aquatic, that protects the ancient titan departure site from treasure hunters and glory-seekers.

It is here that the ogre-elf clans, the Elgres in Common tongue, live; careful selective matchmaking continues to produce exemplary children who are trained to become the outward-facing elite of Obor. Korkein Esimerkki, 20th-Level Expert, is currently the main contact any of the other races have with Obor (except the gnomes of Pradjna) and he is a member of a prominent Jattaltia family that can trace its mixed lineage back for over 350 generations. These islands are almost identical in nature to the Silent Forest, yet most structures are giant-sized. They also each have an airboat docking tower.</p></div>","markdown":""},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{"core":{"sheetClass":"core.JournalTextPageSheet"}}}],"flags":{"cf":{"id":null},"core":{"sourceId":"Compendium.Aventyr-Campaign-Setting.aventyr-campaign.CZklpkirPVkYlgVp"},"scene-packer":{"hash":"fdd58e3603cfda298b3fd31731d921c0b1350b56"}},"_stats":{"systemId":"dnd5e","systemVersion":"2.1.4","coreVersion":"10.291","createdTime":1664018841723,"modifiedTime":1674975191536,"lastModifiedBy":"EsIYTtNnjwxUbKOG"},"_id":"CZklpkirPVkYlgVp","ownership":{"default":0,"R5IsvMTH5P79pBoG":3},"folder":"j9cXBagzZ1ARsO2I","sort":200000},{"name":"Picollo","pages":[{"sort":200000,"name":"Picollo","type":"text","_id":"Fo8ZyJ0HbBDVVALU","title":{"show":false,"level":1},"image":{},"text":{"format":1,"content":"<div class=\"aventyr\">\n<p class=\"s5\">Picollo</p>\n<img style=\"display:block;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto\" src=\"modules/aaw-games-aventyr/Setting-images/Picollo-map-750x277.webp\" width=\"496\" height=\"246\" /></div>\n<div class=\"aventyr\"> </div>\n<div class=\"aventyr\"><img style=\"float:right;margin:0px 15px 15px 0px;border:0px\" src=\"modules/aaw-games-aventyr/Setting-images/halfling-bosun-copy.webp\" width=\"204\" height=\"287\" />\n<p>Two hundred miles off the southern tip of @UUID[JournalEntry.oVgfVPmxlNXfN3CW]{Timaeus} lay the island nation of Picollo. Once an archipelago stretching deep into the southern ocean, much of its ancient lands were destroyed in the Great Schism, crushed by the falling body of the Dracoprime. Only the big island and a few scattered isles survived the cataclysm some 500 years ago, and since the disaster, the peoples and culture of @UUID[JournalEntry.QlctNkzE9injOde9.JournalEntryPage.myrc4omqUaiD3RKZ]{Halfling} society have struggled for their very survival, some might say for their very souls.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Ancient Picollo was first and foremost a peaceful realm of farmers, drinkers, and enjoyers of all the good stuff that life has to offer. Halflings were simple and open people, finding beauty in all the blessings that the gods placed upon their island homes. @UUID[.Gv1vyttllOYQaK2t#mainland-picollo-–-the-big-island]{Mainland Picollo – The Big Island} was covered in green rolling farmlands, save for the @UUID[.Gv1vyttllOYQaK2t#the-great-mountain]{The Great Mountain} in the north, and @UUID[.Gv1vyttllOYQaK2t#the-great-forest]{The Great Forest}to the west. The isles of the archipelago provided a diversity of agricultural products and stimulated halfling naval architecture and maritime trade; in its heyday, the merchant fleets of Picollo traded with most of Aventyr, and trading enclaves from other nations were common on the big island. Many of these grew into larger towns and cities, in contrast to halfling settlements, which remained centered on village life.</p>\n<p>The destruction of the Great Schism changed the face of Picollo forever. The two hundred years following the cataclysm were consumed by efforts to survive and rebuild, but just as the land and people started to recover, @UUID[JournalEntry.QlctNkzE9injOde9.JournalEntryPage.SGw7zGFtvjLNPDMY]{Hoyrall} burst onto the scene. For two centuries the aliens tunnelled inside the great mountain, and then to other parts of Aventyr through the caverns and tunnels of the Underworld that intersected with the new construction. Hives that remained behind launched a full scale invasion of the halfling lands—the invading force wiped out halfling villages everywhere they went, colonizing the land and setting up new hives like mindless drones. The only diplomacy they engaged in was to strip away the alliances of the human settlements in Picollo; the twicelings thought themselves safe but when the ties were cut, the hoyrall broke their agreements and turned, destroying them utterly.</p>\n<p>The remaining halflings took to the forest and isolated slopes of the great mountain. Stealth, trickery, and valiant assaults kept the sorely pressed halflings from being completely overrun, but it was the Confluence and breaking of the hoyrall hive-mind that allowed them to make headway against the invaders. The halflings joined forces with the fey of the great forest and the @UUID[JournalEntry.QlctNkzE9injOde9.JournalEntryPage.t4LZuyNruvzneOHD]{Dwarf} of @UUID[.Gv1vyttllOYQaK2t#stoneroot]{Stoneroot}, wiping their land clean of the insectoid invaders.</p>\n<p>Recovery has been slow; @UUID[JournalEntry.QlctNkzE9injOde9.JournalEntryPage.myrc4omqUaiD3RKZ]{Halfling} tribes returned to their homes to find everything their ancestors had built completely destroyed. They had to start from scratch and build anew. Though once drawn together by a common enemy, despair and exhaustion has taken its toll. In ancient times, nearby villages often joined together to accomplish greater projects than they could alone: now, the rebuilding of Picollo is insular and clannish. Desperate for labor but wary of other humanoids, indentured servitude has been introduced across the island for would-be immigrants. Travelers to these lands find scant welcome and are carefully watched, spied upon by night. Most visitors rarely travel further than the coastal ports due to the @UUID[.PmrSWZmvMcJz6g4H#xenophobia]{Xenophobia} in Picollan villages. Any non-halfling in the interior is assumed to be an @UUID[.PmrSWZmvMcJz6g4H#indentured-servitude]{Indentured Servitude}, or perhaps a freedman who has completed his term of service.</p>\n<p>Modern halflings pay lip service to the merry and celebratory traditions of ancient times, and the end of the wars means that the traditional festivals are once again being celebrated, but there is a darker shadow now to their people, an untrustworthy part.

The original ten elders were elected by the @UUID[.X0uyBqIKLevC15mx#the-eldermoot]{Eldermoot;} currently election to the board is the prerogative of the Council of Freedmen.

Its representatives are chosen not by the freedmen themselves, but by the Eldermoot at the same time as the speakers. A councillor serves a single term of seven years, and the terms are staggered so that a new councillor replaces a retiring one every year.

Gone are the days of bucolic, carefree attitudes and the joy of discovery. The traditional (and often religious) ties of family and community are threatened by an increasing reliance on deal making and practicality. Some families and villages long to return to the ancient traditions, but modern halflings have scant experience with them, save tales of days long past. Most halflings attempt to live a life of tradition as evidenced in these tales, but the agrarian, village-centric life only masks a deeper and more cynical pragmatism.</p>\n<h2>Xenophobia</h2>\n<p>Due to their enslavement during the Hoyrall Wars and betrayal by humanoid settlements in their lands, halflings have become very protective of each other. This protection manifests in different ways; at a very young age all halflings are taught to help one another regardless of their moral standing or ulterior motives. As they grow to maturity, however, halflings begin to realize that they have survived in part due to a darker heritage, one of suspicion and mistrust. This heritage is the one that forges secret pacts, thieves guilds, and dark deals to protect the halfling way of life and prevent outsiders from again betraying or invading their lands.

In desperate need of labor to rebuild, halfling merchants often collect the downtrodden and out-of-luck across Aventyr to ship home and bind to a seven-year term of service. Not only does this provide additional labor and hard coin for the merchant captains who ply the seas, some halflings believe a term of service will teach those of other races the value of loyalty.</p>\n<h2>Religion</h2>\n<img style=\"float:right;margin:0px 15px 15px 0px;border:0px\" src=\"modules/aaw-games-aventyr/Setting-images/Great-Mother.webp\" width=\"195\" height=\"280\" />\n<p>Worship of @UUID[JournalEntry.dOJJ8mRNTPtoihmF.JournalEntryPage.7JZLaCukpLMqn2R2]{The Mother Spirit} still pervades halfling culture and has spread to other lands by way of the many exiles residing across Aventyr.

A few collectives of freedmen have begun to take shape across the landscape of Picollo, but strict land ownership laws have stunted the growth of such communities. Most freedmen remain part of the village in which they served their @UUID[.PmrSWZmvMcJz6g4H#indentured-servitude]{indentureship}.</p><h2>Mainland Picollo – The Big Island</h2><p>Mainland Picollo lies 200 miles south of @UUID[JournalEntry.oVgfVPmxlNXfN3CW]{Timaeus} and encompasses an area close to 900 miles in length. The big island is 400 miles wide at its widest point. At the northern end of the island, the weather is temperate and the Great Mountain rises seven miles to its peak. The western side of the island sports the Great Forest, while the eastern side is made up of rolling farmlands in the interior and deepwater ports on the coast. The fractured southern tip of the island still bears the scars of the Great Schism, and overland travel is difficult in the sub-tropical climate of the south due to the number of fresh and brackish waterways permeating the broken landscape.</p><h3>The Nines</h3><p>LN large town</p><p><strong>Corruption:</strong> +0; <strong>Crime:</strong> +0; <strong>Economy:</strong> +2; <strong>Law:</strong> +1; <strong>Lore:</strong> +0; <strong>Society:</strong> +3</p><p><strong>Qualities:</strong> rumormongering citizens, strategic location, tourist attraction</p><p><strong>Danger:</strong> +5</p><p>DEMOGRAPHICS</p><p><strong>Government:</strong> council</p><p><strong>Population:</strong> 4,750 (3,500 @UUID[JournalEntry.QlctNkzE9injOde9.JournalEntryPage.myrc4omqUaiD3RKZ]{Halfling}; 30 @UUID[JournalEntry.QlctNkzE9injOde9.JournalEntryPage.RTYoyteEKY7EOhy2]{Dweorg}, 200 freedmen humans, 20 freedman other, 900@UUID[.PmrSWZmvMcJz6g4H#indentured-servitude]{ indentured} humans; 100 indentured others)</p><p><strong>Notable NPCs</strong></p><p><strong>Eseld Penberry, First Speaker</strong> (LN Female halfling aristocrat 9)</p><p><strong>Wren Machek, Freedman Councillor</strong> (NE Male human expert 8/warrior 3)</p><p><strong>@UUID[.D1IrajgFIr9gyZFw#jory-tremorgan]{Jory Tremorgan}, Historian</strong> (NG Male halfling wizard 5/expert 7)</p><p>MARKETPLACE</p><p><strong>Base Value:</strong> 2,600 gp; <strong>Purchase Limit:</strong> 10,000 gp; <strong>Spellcasting:</strong> 5th</p><p><strong>Minor Items:</strong> [[/roll 3d4]]; <strong>Medium Items:</strong> [[/roll 2d4]]; Major Items [[/roll 1d4]]</p><p>Located at the mouth of the Marigold river, the nine villages that host the @UUID[.X0uyBqIKLevC15mx#the-eldermoot]{Eldermoot}, @UUID[.X0uyBqIKLevC15mx#board-of-indentures-and-the-council-of-freedmen]{Board of Indentures}, and the@UUID[.X0uyBqIKLevC15mx#board-of-indentures-and-the-council-of-freedmen]{ Council of Freedmen} consist of a deepwater port, milling villages along the river, fishing villages up and down the coast, and farming villages, all within half a day’s travel of each other. Individually, the deepwater port of Culloden and the government seat of Scrivenston would be considered small towns, but the symbiotic relationship of all nine settlements together creates a stronger municipal collective.</p><p>Not included in the name (but certainly in the population count) is a tenth settlement, the freedman colony of Rivercross. Situated across the river from Scrivenston, this village of some 120 souls contains some of the wealthiest freedmen in Picollo. Many owe their riches to a term of service on the Council of Freedmen (with its attendant bribes) and some retain considerable political influence. A few of the freedmen in Rivercross keep indentures of their own, and in general indentures and freedmen from other colonies across Picollo hate those who dwell within and all that Rivercross stands for: the perpetuation of the injustices of the halflings’ “peculiar institution”.</p><p></p><h2>The Isles</h2><p>The ancient archipelago once consisted of thousands of smaller islands stretching three thousand miles to the southwest. Only a handful survived the tectonic disturbances and tidal waves that accompanied the fall of the Dracoprime; the highest concentration of these islands are within 300 miles of the southern tip of the big island. The islands vary in habitability from the uninhabited desert island to tropical paradises; the warming ocean currents of the south flow east to west off the southern tip of mainland Picollo. Clans and villages of seaborn halflings are sometimes found on these islands. The most dangerous stretch of the sea is known as the Spine of the Dragon, where the vertebrae of the Dracoprime pierces the surface of the ocean, creating vicious currents and putting ships at hazard.</p><h2>The Great Mountain</h2><p>The base of the mountain is over 100 miles in diameter, surrounded by rolling hills. No other peaks compete with the seven-mile high summit; the mass that is the Great Mountain is unique. Many valleys and rises, both forested and grassy, lie sheltered on the great slopes of the mountain and alluvial rivers cascade off cliffsides, running swiftly through these vales. The civilized races on the mountain include the @UUID[JournalEntry.QlctNkzE9injOde9.JournalEntryPage.RTYoyteEKY7EOhy2]{Dweorg} at the base in their city of @UUID[.Gv1vyttllOYQaK2t#stoneroot]{Stoneroot}, highland halfling clans on the slopes, and @UUID[JournalEntry.QlctNkzE9injOde9.JournalEntryPage.MsDyrandNiqdPIrd]{Zwerc} cloud fortresses near the peak. Monsters and tribes of monstrous humanoids (as well as some giants) live in the many hidden valleys of the mountain; some have even taken over the old @UUID[JournalEntry.QlctNkzE9injOde9.JournalEntryPage.SGw7zGFtvjLNPDMY]{Hoyrall} tunnels that riddle portions of the Great Mountain’s interior (though hoyrall have not been seen on the slopes or in the tunnels of the Great Mountain since the end of the wars.) An amber road runs from deep within the bones of the mountain to its peak, guarded by the dweorgs of Stonehelm and the zwerc in the clouds above.</p><h3>Stoneroot</h3><p>LN small city</p><p><strong>Corruption:</strong> +-1; <strong>Crime:</strong> +1; <strong>Economy:</strong> +4; <strong>Law:</strong> +2; <strong>Lore:</strong> -1; <strong>Society:</strong> +6</p><p><strong>Qualities:</strong> holy site, prosperous, strategic location, tourist attraction</p><p><strong>Danger:</strong> +5</p><p>DEMOGRAPHICS</p><p><strong>Government:</strong> council</p><p><strong>Population:</strong> 8,850 (7,000 @UUID[JournalEntry.QlctNkzE9injOde9.JournalEntryPage.RTYoyteEKY7EOhy2]{Dweorg}; 500 @UUID[JournalEntry.QlctNkzE9injOde9.JournalEntryPage.myrc4omqUaiD3RKZ]{Halfling}; 1,000 humans (freedmen); 100 @UUID[.PmrSWZmvMcJz6g4H#indentured-servitude]{indentured} humans; 250 other)</p><p><strong>Notable NPCs</strong></p><p><strong>Rogan Hardamber, Dwarven Council</strong> (LN Male dweorg fighter 9)</p><p><strong>Rory Bessamer, Freedman Demagogue</strong> (CN Male human bard 7)</p><p><strong>@UUID[.D1IrajgFIr9gyZFw#elerin-crosseyes]{Elerin Crosseyes}, Merchant</strong> (LN Female halfling expert 10)</p><p>MARKETPLACE</p><p><strong>Base Value:</strong> 6,400 gp; <strong>Purchase Limit:</strong> 37,250 gp; <strong>Spellcasting:</strong> 8th</p><p><strong>Minor Items:</strong> [[/roll 4d4]]; <strong>Medium Items:</strong> [[/roll 3d4]]; <strong>Major Items:</strong> [[/roll 1d6]]</p><p>The city of Stoneroot is carved into walls of a great sea cavern at the base of the Great Mountain on the eastern shore of mainland Picollo. The size of the entrance to the cave as well as a great underground river allows a significant amount of maritime trade to pass through the city, and the dweorg keep a harbor fleet of galleys for defense. Tunnels and avenues lead to the surface, as well as deeper into the mountain itself.</p><p>The dweorg are excellent smiths; magical arms and armor under the base price are more likely to be available in Stoneroot (85%), but staves, rings, wands, rods, and wondrous items are less likely to be available (65%). Most such items are brokered by halfling middlemen who represent zwerc mages from the cloud fortresses above, or on the black market, due to the friction between dweorg and zwerc. Scrolls and potions can be found normally.</p><p>The non-dweorg population of Stoneroot consists of halfling diplomats, merchants, and craftsmen, and their indentured servants (the dweorg do not keep indentures), as well as freedmen. Many abolitionist societies use this city as a base of operations, due to the more egalitarian government of the dwarves.</p><h2>The Great Forest</h2><p>One of the last bastions of resistance during the wars, the Great Forest suffered the least damage from the @UUID[JournalEntry.QlctNkzE9injOde9.JournalEntryPage.SGw7zGFtvjLNPDMY]{Hoyrall} invaders. Though some portions of the perimeter suffered depredation, the interior maintains its primaeval characteristics, guarded and husbanded by the fey living within. Magical and mystical creatures also share the virgin woodland; not all are friendly. In addition to the fey living in the woods, villages of tree-borer halflings can also be found, as well as the scattered humanoid settlements of runaway indentures and independently inclined freedmen.</p><p>The Great Oak of the Mother is located somewhere in the Great Forest. In ancient times, holy druids transplanted acorns from the tree to the central greens of many halfling communities. Only a few of these “Second Growth” trees survive; they are among the most powerful foci of divine magic on the island. The location of the Great Oak has been lost to time—it is rumored that its sacred grove contains a magical gate to the home sanctuary of  @UUID[JournalEntry.dOJJ8mRNTPtoihmF.JournalEntryPage.7JZLaCukpLMqn2R2]{The Mother Spirit}.</p><p></p><p></p></div>","markdown":""},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}},{"sort":800000,"name":"Significant Characters","type":"text","_id":"D1IrajgFIr9gyZFw","title":{"show":false,"level":1},"image":{},"text":{"format":1,"content":"<div class=\"aventyr\">\n<p class=\"s5\">Significant Characters</p>\n<h2>Jory Tremorgan</h2>\n<img style=\"float:right;margin:0px 15px 15px 0px;border:0px\" src=\"modules/aaw-games-aventyr/Setting-images/halfling-Crosseyes.webp\" width=\"146\" height=\"366\" />\n<p><strong>Historian</strong> (NG Male halfling wizard 5/expert 7)</p>\n<p>A member of the @UUID[.X0uyBqIKLevC15mx#board-of-indentures-and-the-council-of-freedmen]{Board of Indentures and the Council of Freedmen}, Tremorgan is almost convinced that the halfling’s “peculiar institution” is leading them away from their heritage.

A hero may be the exception to the rule, but will never let other races know the secrets of their homeland.

Halflings from exiled backgrounds are more likely to be trusting of non-halflings and tend to hold more true to the ancient ways and happy-go-lucky traditions of halfling society. Those whose families suffered during the @UUID[.SGw7zGFtvjLNPDMY]{Hoyrall} Wars and enslavement are more prone to pragmatism. This practical outlook has begun to erode the traditional paths of fellowship and community. Though fragile, a bond does still remain between all halflings; it is taboo for one halfling to kill another even under dire circumstances; those that do face banishment. When banding together in groups halflings are a force to be reckoned with.</p>\n<h2>Vast Swamp</h2>\n<p>Halflings are often called upon when the Black Gold Consortium needs something done in a tight spot. Small folk can often find employment cleaning or fixing in-between the cogs of extraction centers, or removing blockages in tall chimneys or long pipes; the work is always dangerous, so they expect to be paid well. The Neliton family is one of the core families in the consortium and in charge of halfling relations in @UUID[JournalEntry.g4odaMsHbRkeNFhn.JournalEntryPage.Tdkqx23iD22AVlLv]{Cherrian’s Rest}. The family’s easy going nature has protected them from the internal conflicts of the consortium—they love to show off their strong sense of fashion.

Some halflings spend their whole lives on ships traveling between these isles, mainland Picollo, and the rest of Aventyr.

The Vikmordere had been using @UUID[JournalEntry.ismpCNWpGHvB1iPw]{Rybalka}, a village of tribal fishermen and woodworkers as a base of operations for their attacks on the three Riverside Klavekian villages. The village of Rybalka also works a local iron mine which supplied ore for the Vikmordere weapons and shipbuilding tools.</p>\n<p>  The Klavek Kingdom Monarchy moved troops into the Vikmordere Valley and launched an arduous assault against the Vikmordere in hopes of securing this strategic location and obtaining the lucrative iron mine. After many failed attempts and the death of hundreds of Klavekian ground troops, the Klavek Kingdom was finally able to oust the Vikmordere raiders and take over the small village and local mine. In order to hold the location, additional troops were brought in to clear the mountainside forests of the rest of the Vikmordere warriors which resulted in horrible casualties for the Klavekians. Eventually, almost every Vikmordere in a 15-mile radius was slaughtered. A few Vikmordere survived by hiding in abandoned ruins and mountain caves, which were passed up by the Klavek Kingdom soldiers seeing as it was impossible to follow every possible lead in such a large territory.</p>\n<p>The majority of the Vikmordere people still thrive in the mountains and in the deep recesses of the winding Serpent Lake, waiting for the day when a great Vikmordere champion rises up to lead them to victory and reclamation of their ancestor’s land and the village now called “Rybalka” by the filthy Klavs.</p>\n</div>","markdown":""},"_id":"sPIEyCZy4k35amgs","image":{},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"sort":900000,"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"JournalEntry.aQr9obWamQcmAPUN.JournalEntryPage.wRMpAyePvqRtSHn0"}}},{"name":"Human (Klavekian)","type":"text","title":{"show":false,"level":2},"text":{"format":1,"content":"<div class=\"aventyr\">\n<p class=\"s5\">Human (Klavekian)</p>\n<img style=\"float:left;margin:0px 15px 15px 0px;border:0px\" src=\"modules/aaw-games-aventyr/Races-Images/Klavekian-Human-Male.webp\" width=\"282\" height=\"365\" />\n<p><em> </em></p>\n<p>Klavekians are a hearty steadfast people who have been dealt with impossible odds and found ways to cope.

Over thousands of years, the weak have died out while the strong have prospered, leaving a people able to withstand cold temperatures and sometimes go for days at a time without food or water. Although wilderness travel is rarer for those living in big cities, all Klavekians at one time or another must make overland journeys at which point they experience what it truly means to be Klavekian. The Klavek Kingdom retains a massive military presence which dominates the known world.

The following is the story the dwarves tell when asked how they were brought into being.</p>\n<h2>Forging of the Dverger</h2>\n<p>In the days of darkness when the world was young, the gods forged a race from the very heart of the world itself.</p>\n<p>They called this race “Dvergr” and placed them close to the heart of Motherworld.</p>\n<p>The Dvergr thrived and prospered, but as time went on they became greedy, fighting over the precious metals and gems of the Motherworld.</p>\n<p>   The gods foresaw the destruction of the Dvergr at their own hands, thus they divided the race into five parts, each sharing the appearance of the first Dvergr (but only a fragment of its whole)</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>The first </strong>were named @UUID[.RTYoyteEKY7EOhy2]{Dweorg}, and were created from the Dvergr’s hands and heart giving them honor and expert craftsmanship.</p>\n<p><strong>The second</strong> were made from the @UUID[.eMZGcsX17wpAg4DE]{Dvergr’s head} and kept its most proud of names. They stayed deep beneath the world toiling in their greatest cities, only an echo of their former selves.</p>\n<p><strong>The third </strong>were named the @UUID[.MsDyrandNiqdPIrd]{Zwerc}, created from the spirits of the Dvergr. This granted them innate power over magic, their mystical nature making them loners and travelers with an endless thirst for knowledge.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The potent avarice of the Dvergr, however, would not be undone by the gods—traveling far from the deific crafting, the very essence of their greed delved deep into Aventyr, much deeper than the gods had permitted the Dvergr to go. Soon they had discovered HEL—where devils and demons dwell—and while the first three races were created, a pact was forged with the denizens there. The devils granted the Dvergr’s avarice physical form and realms in the deepest, most foul and flaming depths of the Underworld—but they did not stop there. The devils gave the @UUID[.Atn2VIF5a1D1uJUZ]{Gitwerc} the ability to siphon souls from the other races to feed themselves, and in turn they granted the Gitwerc more power.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>When the gods returned to forge the fourth, they found the Dvergr’s entrails snatched up by devils who had turned them into a terrible creature, the Gitwerc.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The gods, realizing their mistake in creating a race with no evil intent, vowed never to do so again and went to work creating the fifth race in secret, using all the remaining parts of the Dvergr. The fifth and final race would be eloquent, honorable, knowledgeable, and nearly immortal, yet the race would be forever divided, torn between light and darkness. Their souls were permanently bound to the world, sentenced with a nearly endless life staring out upon the sea of eternity, never able to attain that balance which comes so easy to the other races. The gods placed this race above and below the world, both in light and in darkness; they became the @UUID[.ei36LjIhEoh87vgE]{Elves} and the @UUID[.8HyVcZ70eyhwNJsu]{Drow}.</p>\n<p>     Then the gods did something which surprised all of the races. They created a realm between Upperworld and the Underworld, using the culminating thoughts of all the new races to forge the “Gift from the Gods”, the first humans: Askr and Embla.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>This gift would bring balance to the world.</strong></p>\n</div>","markdown":""},"_id":"t4LZuyNruvzneOHD","image":{},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"sort":1900000,"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"JournalEntry.Q6HzSBK0eklvkhs2.JournalEntryPage.p9zpIU4TMugYgXJS"}}},{"name":"Dweorg","type":"text","title":{"show":false,"level":3},"text":{"format":1,"content":"<div class=\"aventyr\">\n<p class=\"s5\">Dweorg</p>\n<img style=\"float:left;margin:0px 15px 15px 0px;border:0px\" src=\"modules/aaw-games-aventyr/Races-Images/Dweorg-171x300.webp\" width=\"171\" height=\"300\" />\n<p><em> </em></p>\n<p>Dweorg are the most common @UUID[.t4LZuyNruvzneOHD]{Dwarven} subtype, denizens of the Underworld that enjoy mining and blacksmithing.

In the past, Vikmordere raiders used the strategic location of the fishing village as a launching point for attacks against the @UUID[JournalEntry.QVrlu0lTv2vFtT5P]{Klavek Kingdom}. An abundant iron mine nearby provided all the ore the Vikmordere raiders needed for their tools, weapons, and armor.</p>\n<p>The Klavekian Monarchy moved troops into the @UUID[JournalEntry.Cg0Nt8mDPQ7JrmyB]{Vikmordere Valley} and launched an arduous assault against the Vikmordere in hopes of securing this strategic location and obtaining the lucrative iron mine. After many failed attempts and the deaths of hundreds of Klavekian ground troops, the Klavek Kingdom was finally able to oust the Vikmordere raiders from Rybalka. In order to hold the location, additional troops were brought in to clear the mountainside forests of the rest of the Vikmordere warriors. This resulted in horrible casualties for the Klavekians, losing 10 soldiers for every 1 Vikmordere raider found and killed. Many of the Vikmordere avoided persecution by hiding in abandoned ruins and mountain caves where it is thought they still exist to this day.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<img style=\"display:block;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto\" src=\"modules/aaw-games-aventyr/Setting-images/Serpent-Lake-Map-Todd-Gamble.png\" width=\"650\" height=\"571\" />\n<p> </p>\n<img style=\"float:right;margin:0px 15px 15px 0px;border:0px\" title src=\"modules/aaw-games-aventyr/Setting-images/Klavekian-Warrior-Nestor-the-Dragon-480x579.webp\" width=\"272\" height=\"328\" />\n<p>The Klavek Kingdom placed a permanent contingent of guardsmen at Rybalka to protect the populace and the vital iron mine.</p>\n<p>Without access to the ore in the mine, the Vikmordere’s military strength and foothold on the region has been greatly reduced.</p>\n<p>Many Rybalkan Vikmordere villagers who were not affiliated with the raiders were allowed to stay and live freely in the village if they continued to provide services to the Klavek Kingdom settlers. These services include blacksmithing, fishing, mining, and ship construction as well as various menial tasks requested from time to time. Racism in Rybalka is still quite prevalent, especially amongst the Klavekian settlers, and a few interracial families that were harassed and persecuted by the Klavekians moved into the dangerous and unforgiving wilderness just to escape the ignorance and hatred of the average Klavekian settler.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<img style=\"display:block;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto\" src=\"modules/aaw-games-aventyr/Setting-images/Rybalka-close-up-750x465.webp\" width=\"607\" height=\"423\" />\n<h2>Fishing</h2>\n<p>Rybalka has established a very lucrative trade with the other towns and cities in the @UUID[JournalEntry.QVrlu0lTv2vFtT5P]{Klavek homeland}. The rare mountain fish caught in the @UUID[.Erya8w29cRTTJELu]{Serpent Lake} are highly coveted in the metropolitan areas of the Klavek Kingdom.</p>\n<h2>Logging</h2>\n<p>Two logging camps exist on the Rybalkan Peninsula. The most prominent of these is a @UUID[.mGX47vjQ83yO2l2T#logging]{small logging camp} which exists in the forested hills west of Rybalka. The camp contains two outbuildings, a smithy, and logging equipment. A water flume redirects water from a stream in the hills into the camp to turn a mill-blade and operate saws. Trees are harvested and transported out of the hills and into the great glacial lake. The logs are then loaded on a barge to float down Serpent Lake to the Serpent Tail River and into the waiting hands of the Klavek riverside settlements below.</p>\n<h2>Mining</h2>\n<p>The heavily fortified Rybalkan Mine is northeast of Rybalka. The iron mine imports/exports directly with the Klavekian Monarchy and does not fall under Rybalkan jurisdiction despite its close proximity. The mined ore is shipped via replica Vikmordere vessels through the @UUID[.Erya8w29cRTTJELu]{Serpent Lake} and Serpent’s Tail River into the Klavek Homeland. The large amounts of ore being pulled from the mine has prompted the Klavek Kingdom to invest additional funding and expansion plans to Rybalka as well as an increase in ground troops to patrol the nearby countryside.</p>\n<h2>Climate</h2>\n<p>The temperature varies considerably depending on the season; summer can be as warm as 65F (18C) and winter can be as cold as 8F (-13C). There is generally snow on the ground from early fall until mid spring, although depending on weather patterns this can change.</p>\n<p>Cold winds tend to rush down out of the mountains in winter and push through the valley and down Serpent Lake into the lowland plains below. In winter much of the lake freezes over completely making travel by boat difficult if not impossible.</p>\n<p>In spring when the snow begins to melt many animals with new offspring venture down to the shores of the Serpent Lake. The surrounding forested hillsides go into full bloom. Spring and summer both display the beauty of the land and the true reason why the locals stay and live in such a harsh environment most of the year.</p>\n<p>The end of summer is a time of feasting and celebration.</p>\n<h2>Everyday Life</h2>\n<p>A Rybalkan day begins as the sun finally reaches high enough in the sky to cast its light over the jagged peaks of the Eastern Mountains. The suns rays hit the crystallized snow cover creating myriad colors; lights begin to dance upon the partially frozen @UUID[.Erya8w29cRTTJELu]{Serpent Lake}. The folk living in the small village begin to stir and go about their daily duties; fishermen push their skiffs over the jagged chunks of ice and into the water, Rybalkan Soldiers gear up for wilderness patrols, and the blacksmith stokes the fire at the smithy.</p>\n<h2>Trades</h2>\n<p>The majority of townsfolk in Rybalka are lumberjacks, miners, or fishermen. The only other trades in Rybalka obtain their roots in the three major professions thus woodworking, blacksmithing, and cooking are the secondary trades.</p>\n<h2>Construction</h2>\n<p>Most of the structures in Rybalka are cabins and constructed of wood harvested from the nearby mountain forest. A few permanent structures like the Rybalka Temple are built from stone.</p>\n<h2>Tradition</h2>\n<p>The entrance to a man’s cabin usually has a large set of antlers hanging directly over the door as a sign of virility. Upon marrying, the wife will traditionally hang small bundles of aromatic herbs from the antlers, along with semi-precious stones placed in specific places upon them using tree sap; these herbs are refreshed by the wife weekly.</p>\n<p>When a married couple gives birth to their first child, they take down the antlers and hang a circular wooden disc carved by a native Vikmordere villager over their front door. The Vikmordere villager blesses the disc and the home to ward away evil spirits and calls upon nature to protect the family. Although new arrivals scoff at this practice (calling it superstitious nonsense) they soon find out the hard way that no protection from the wild land brings evil to your doorstep. Before long even the most hardened in their stance invite a native to show them how to protect their home and family from the evils spawned from the nearby Dark Wood</p>\n<img style=\"display:block;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto\" src=\"modules/aaw-games-aventyr/Setting-images/Village-of-Rybalka-Illustration-by-Todd-Gamble.webp\" width=\"594\" height=\"355\" /></div>","markdown":""},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"sort":0,"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{"monks-enhanced-journal":{"appendix":false},"core":{"sheetClass":""}}},{"name":"Rybalkan Establishments","type":"text","_id":"zpUSPaV4mxOVvVDx","title":{"show":false,"level":1},"image":{},"text":{"format":1,"content":"<div class=\"aventyr\">\n<p class=\"s5\">Rybalkan Establishments</p>\n<h2>Rybalka City Hall</h2>\n<p>The governmental hub of the small village, this intimidating structure contains the guard barracks, mayor’s quarters, the council court, among others important facilities.</p>\n<img style=\"display:block;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto\" src=\"modules/aaw-games-aventyr/Setting-images/Rybalka-City-Hall-1-of-2.webp\" width=\"486\" height=\"800\" />\n<p>The governmental hub of the small village, this intimidating structure contains the guard barracks, records/licensing, village jail, mayor’s office, council court, and @UUID[.AMC4KKCcHuBgS853#mayor-igor-leonid]{the mayor’s} personal living quarters.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<section id=\"secret-J2CFEg1Z3ESt8owz\" class=\"secret\">\n<p>Two secret rooms are hidden within the onion domes.

Sulwotik Spirits serves up heavily intoxicating spirits made from local berries which while tasting quite sour quickly warm up a chilled weary traveler. Traditional Vikmordere foods are served here which are a mix of the Vikmordere tribal nomad diet and the Vikmordere settler staples.

Quorron can produce Masterwork Armor and Axes for (+50%).</p>\n<h2>Rybalka Lodge</h2>\n<p>The Rybalka Lodge had always been the finest establishment in town. A meeting place for visitors and dignitaries and place where one could always find a warm meal and a clean bed. That all ended around a year ago when the lodge mysteriously caught fire and burnt to the ground. After the suspected arson of the original lodge, one of the lodge’s former patrons- Albreck Samson decided to rebuild. Albreck, spent his life savings on the reconstruction of the old building. He wanted every detail of the new lodge to match the former establishment.</p>\n<p>The construction process was plagued by strange occurrences which always seemed to happen at night. The carpenters would return each morning to find tools missing and ladders knocked over. Although these incidents happened quite frequently the pranksters never caused any harm to the workers.

The Balcan family have been in the distilling business for seven generations now, eight if you count the couple of youngsters scampering around the yard and getting underfoot. Several of the younger members of the family travel far and wide promoting their product, but most of the family is employed in and around the yard, tending the copper vats and stores of maturing alcohol in cask.</p>\n<p>The secret, as Markus Balcan just might tell you, is the spring rising in back of the yard. Its fresh, clear water imparts a distinctive pure taste to the grain alcohol the family is rightly renowned for producing.

Each month the password changes and only those who have money, gems, or valuable items are allowed entry. Fin makes the final call on who is allowed in and out. A huge bouncer named Gqum guards entry to the gambling room which can only be accessed from the outside balcony. Gqum does not speak or negotiate.

From a distance it looks like a drop of blood on snow, hence its name. The petals of the Bloodflower can be crushed and are able to lessen the effects of intoxination with the single side effect of causing a bad breath. Winning a drinking contest versus an opponent who uses Bloodflowers in his drink is barely possible, for he won’t feel much of the effects and after a few mugs he just has to exhale in his opponent’s general direction. It not only stinks to turn all but a half-orc’s stomach, it also carries the alcoholic amounts it bound in the opponents direction.</p><p>Bloodflowers grow nearly everywhere, and certain people in Rybalka grow them in their gardens to give newcomers a special welcome in a friendly drinking contest.</p><h2>Coldflower</h2><p>The coldflower grows near the timberline. Its iceblue petals are cold to the touch. Coldflowers are liked by the remorhaz of the North, who eat them whenever possible. Even in a fight there’s a 1 in 4 chance that they eat instead of attacking. Additionally, when the remorhaz has eaten a coldflower the dreaded heat ability of the polar worms is dulled by the effect and only half as potent for an hour. Plucking a flower keeps that ability for but a day, and alchemists of the North have tried in vain to emulate the ability of the coldflower or at least keep it fresh for an extended time.</p><h2>Liverleaf</h2><p>This flower is all green, petals, leaves and stem. It blooms only a few days each year, when the sun doesn’t set. The long leaves, which are curled when the eight orange petals are open, is highly prized in @UUID[JournalEntry.QlctNkzE9injOde9.JournalEntryPage.DXD1ygEckY0JIUFB]{Klavekian} noble restaurants, for it tastes like the very expensive fresh liver of a remorhaz. Obviously it’s much less dangerous plucking that taste then getting it fresh from a most likely enraged polar worm. The leaves have to be dusted as long as they are curled, then applied to meat like a spice. A single leave can turn the taste of a chicken into the taste of liver.</p><h2>Oreadian Flower</h2><p>This plant is named after the notoriously closemouthed oreadians, for its petals are almost always closed, too. Only when its freezing cold the blue petals open and their nectar can be harvested. The oreadian flower is warm, almost hot, and attracts creatures by the warmth in order to procreate.</p><p>The nectar of one oreadian flower is enough to heal small wounds for 2-5 points of damage, but it heals the double amount of wounds from cold and, maybe due to its warmth, cures exhaustion from cold sources. Northerners are known for using magical cold to get the petals to open and to harvest them.</p><h2>Singing tree</h2><p>This tree grow sparsely on the northern edge of the @UUID[.zUmf61j380tilNZt]{Dark Wood}. Its wood is very hard, able to dull a logger’s ax, but it’s easily affected by magic like Warp Wood, which has a stronger effect on the material and can easily transfer two times the normal amount. The oddest thing about the trees are its fruits, though. They ripe in the short summer of the North, then the nutlike shells open, releasing the seed. The shells keep hanging on the tree and freeze over as early as autumn. In the winter the winds let the shells chime and sometimes even sing. Certain feys collect the shells right before they thaw in spring, before they fall down and shatter, and use them to built musical instruments.</p><h2>Winterflower</h2><p>The Winterflower is the rarest flower in the world and even a festival is named after it. It thrives in cold mountainous regions and has a reputation for growing on difficult-to-access mountain peaks and cliffs. It is the only known flower to grow through layers of snow to reach the sunlight. The one to retrieve a Winterflower and transplant it near Rybalka receives great praise from the entire village. The Wildflower is considered a blessing which protects the village from harm. Only once in the past eight years has this feat been accomplished.</p><p></p></div>","markdown":""},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"sort":0,"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}},{"name":"Fauna of the North","type":"text","_id":"BSbDtCDmgwQBw1co","title":{"show":false,"level":1},"image":{},"text":{"format":1,"content":"<div class=\"aventyr\"><p class=\"s5\">Fauna of the North</p><p>The animal life of the northern lands includes common animals big and small like yaks, vultures, rats or cave bears, but also a few less well known like those described below.</p><h2>Coppercat</h2><p>Coppercats live near the mines or with settlers who have adopted them but are rarely seen in other parts of the Rybalkan peninsula. They are named after their long coppery fur, but legend tells that this is not the only reason for their name. @UUID[JournalEntry.QlctNkzE9injOde9.JournalEntryPage.t4LZuyNruvzneOHD]{Dwarves} and oreads are rumored to use them to sniff out valuable deposits of ore, and a legend tells of an oread who found the Rybalkan mine by following a coppercat through the mountains. In settlements coppercats like iron ovens, but that may be connected to the warmth those oven produce more than to the metal. Experiments with leashed coppercats in the mountains have but produced disinterested cats and frustrated would-be prospectors.</p><h2>Daggersheep</h2><p>The daggersheep lives mainly at the shores of the @UUID[.Erya8w29cRTTJELu]{Serpent Lake} and in the lower reaches of the Jagged Crags. Though it looks like a sheep from afar, the name is misleading, for the daggersheep is biologically related to the goat, not the sheep. The daggerlike horns for which it is named and its aggressiveness when cornered makes it difficult to tame, so it usually is but hunted. It has a soft wool which is easy to weave and fat flesh to offer, but tends to flee into the mountain ranges like the goat it really is. The white wool it grows when the temperatures start to fall makes it difficult to spot in the snow. Winter clothes made out of daggersheep wool are warm, but stink heavily and tend to curl when wet, which hasn’t made it very popular in the @UUID[JournalEntry.QVrlu0lTv2vFtT5P]{Klavek Kingdom}. The horns of a daggersheep are known to be able to store electricity during the summer storms in the Jagged Crags.</p><h2>Fourflowerhunter</h2><p>The fourflowerhunter is a tiny predatory bird with orange wings, way too small to endanger humans or even halfling children. They live from insects, which they hunt while emulating the @UUID[.w79VOo3UeUGraouv#liverleaf]{liverleaf flowers} with their wings. Four of the birds form the image of one flower by sticking their heads together so that insects are fooled and fall an easy prey, almost flying directly into the beaks of the fourflowerhunters until it’s too late to get away in time.</p></div>","markdown":""},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"sort":0,"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}},{"name":"Serpent Lake","type":"text","_id":"Erya8w29cRTTJELu","title":{"show":false,"level":1},"image":{},"text":{"format":1,"content":"<div class=\"aventyr\">\n<p class=\"s5\">Serpent Lake</p>\n<p>An expansive lake which meanders hundreds of miles through the Vikmordere Valley. The valley and the lakes were carved out over two thousand years ago when a massive glacier passed through the area. In the great Serpent Lake the preferred method of travel is by boat. One must be cautious and hire an expensive and well trained navigator to steer through the maze that is Serpent Lake lest they lose their way.</p>\n<img style=\"display:block;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto\" src=\"modules/aaw-games-aventyr/Setting-images/Serpent-Lake-Map-Todd-Gamble-750x497.webp\" width=\"750\" height=\"497\" />\n<p>The Lake is named after large slimy black predatory serpents which are spotted surfacing from time to time. Legends speak of a behemoth Serpent which dwells in the deepest darkest part of the lake. The Serpent is rumored to surface and feast upon entire ships which lose their way in the confusing corridor of linked lakes of the Vikmordere Valley.</p>\n<p>The Serpent Lake is largely navigable over the whole year in most parts, only the shores freeze in winter in its southern and middle parts. Further north the lake almost totally freezes, maybe due to a lack of depth. Sages speculate about the reason for the southern and middle parts being so free of ice, hot springs in the depth being the most common explanation, though the water does indeed feel very cold. The oreads do think that there is salt in the sea, even if it is defined as freshwater, but the salt was somehow changed by the Ancestors, who were experts at earth magic and known to work with subterranean salts, as the Wall of Salt that seals Aisnley’s Lake from the Serpent Sea confirms. Rumors speak of a whole palace made of salt with something sleeping in it, waiting with inhuman patience to be awakened once more.</p>\n<p>Although the Serpent Lake has its share of dangerous sea serpents, there are of course countless other harmless animals in it also. The most common are listed in the following section.</p>\n<h2>Snowsquid</h2>\n<p>The squids in the Serpent Lake are thick-skinned and even more rubbery then their more known cousins from the south. They are as white as snow, which let to their name. The meat of snowsquids takes about two hours to cook, but is very tasty. Its not storeable without magic, though, losing its consistency after a day and developing a stench that’s not only tough to bear – Fortitude DC 15 or nauseated as long as in 50 feet distance to the squid or 100 feet downwind from it – it also tends to attract remorhazes, who seems to think of it as a rare delicacy. After three days the stench (and remorhaz-attracting) stops and the meat is no longer eatable for creatures who are not carrion crawlers.</p>\n<p>On at least two occasions there have been round wounds on a washed on @UUID[.Erya8w29cRTTJELu#wintereel]{wintereel} , causing rumors of a giant squid living somewhere in the Lake with tentacles big and strong enough to crack a ship’s hull.</p>\n<h2>Snow Water Lily</h2>\n<p>In remote corners of the Serpent Lake the snow water lily grows. Although it looks a bit withered and brittle to most observants, the kitsune of the @UUID[.zUmf61j380tilNZt]{Dark Wood} trade a fortune in for each living exemplary. It’s unknown what they need them for, but it has raised the interest of other inhabitants in recent years.</p>\n<h2>Wintereel</h2>\n<p>Some say that the name of the Serpent Lake originated from a bad perception. There are some big eels in the lake easily mistaken for a sea serpent, which may give this story credit. Biggest among those harmless freshwater eels is the wintereel, which is 3 feet long and light blue in color. It can even go on land, and many an unsuspecting witness was shocked to see such a giant fish crawling through the mud. Wintereels are not tasty and generally harmless, they avoid fishing vessels and oretransports and are ignored by the twolegged landwalkers in turn. From time to time a badly mauled wintereel is washed on shore, giving fresh food to the tales of big sea serpents and sharks in the deeper parts of the lake.</p>\n<h2>Woolly Crab</h2>\n<p>Most notable of the inhabitants of the Serpent Lake is the wooly crab, which has patches of light orange fur in the northern reaches of the lake, deepening to a dark red in the southern parts. The crab burrows into the sands when threatened, but if unearthed can provide a healthy meal for a grown human that lasts for a day. The burrowed crabs are almost perfectly hidden though, one needs a survival check DC 20 to spot a part of their fur or shell poking up. The shells are recently coming into favor in @UUID[JournalEntry.QVrlu0lTv2vFtT5P]{Klavek }as a new form to decorate noble estates, but it’s tough to say how long this particular fashion trend will stay.</p>\n</div>","markdown":""},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"sort":0,"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{"core":{"sheetClass":""}}},{"name":"Dark Wood","type":"text","_id":"zUmf61j380tilNZt","title":{"show":false,"level":1},"image":{},"text":{"format":1,"content":"<div class=\"aventyr\"><p class=\"s5\">Dark Wood</p><p>Feared and respected by even the most powerful Vikmordere warriors, the Dark Wood is a shadowy and foreboding place. Legend speaks of a horrible deed done by evil druidic sorcerers long ago which created a rift to another world through which devils spawned. @UUID[.gu6JRkzbpzHfoNf6#ruins/crypt-of-sun-lord-kateek]{The Sun Lord Ka’Teek} of the Ancestors along with his followers battled many of the beasts and were able to seal the rift. Unfortunately the damage was already done; The devils and maybe even demons had spread into the forest now known as Dark Wood. Over hundreds of years the devils from the rift bred with the creatures of the forest creating all manner of foul monsters.</p><p>Travel through Dark Wood is extremely dangerous during the day and considered suicide if undertaken at night. Regional hunters must learn the art of the warrior or die in this unforgiving land. The strong survive while the weak become fodder for the beasts of Dark Wood.</p><h2>The three parts</h2><p>In reality the feared Dark Wood consists of three separate woods with very specific features to each of them. One part of the forest is dominated and formed by the fey, the second by the devils that were let lose here, and the third is the contested area between those two, which is partly a battleground and partly ignored, which makes that tiny part a fairly normal wood.</p><h2>The forest of the fey</h2><p>This part of the wood has many great trees with leaves as thick as barrels, the canopy woven together like a roof. In most parts the sky can’t be seen from the grounds, which was a reason for the name of the Dark Wood. Oddly enough, and surely a sign of fey intervention, there is much undergrowth, narrow gullets and bramble-infested thickets. Strange berries grow in this land, but trespassers are advised to let them be, since the fey are known to hunt down all who pluck them. Thus very little is known about them and the other fruits of the faeries. There are rumors of healing berries, berries that cure sickness or even exhaustion, and berries that are like alcohol growing on bushes. A strange land it is, reigned by a mighty dryad if rumors are to be believed.</p><p></p><h2>The forest of the devils</h2><p>Where the fiends run rampart, the forest is bleeding. That’s not literary so, most of those rumors are regarded as at least inflated, but the devils have left their marks for sure. Since it’s almost impossible to reach the devil-part of the Dark Wood without crossing through the fey-part, which is dangerous enough, information about the home of the infernals are scarce. Sometimes a devil crosses the fey-part to reach human lands, though, and the resulting battles take a heavy toll each time. The current colonization reinforcement is partly caused due to such a transgression, and the @UUID[JournalEntry.QVrlu0lTv2vFtT5P]{Klavekian} government has reacted to the demand for a whole legion of soldiers by sending a few adventurer groups. The joy of the populace of @UUID[JournalEntry.ismpCNWpGHvB1iPw]{Rybalka} is a bit less then boundless about this Klavekian decision to save money.</p><h2>The contested forest</h2><p>There are known ways through parts of the forest where the chances to avoid devils and fey are better than elsewhere. Those paths are shifting, though, depending on the latest conflicts, and adventurers are still strongly urged to keep away from the Dark Woods. There are some tough souls who live in the friendlier parts, most notably there is the Hunter’s Cabin of Cual Beartooth, but rumors tell the man who lived there has long been abducted by one of the fighting parties.</p><p></p></div>","markdown":""},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"sort":0,"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}},{"name":"The Jagged Crags","type":"text","_id":"vLMBL7x85Ve3NC06","title":{"show":false,"level":1},"image":{},"text":{"format":1,"content":"<div class=\"aventyr\">\n<p class=\"s5\">The Jagged Crags</p>\n<img style=\"display:block;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto\" src=\"modules/aaw-games-aventyr/Setting-images/Jagged-Crags.webp\" width=\"707\" height=\"435\" />\n<p>The Jagged Crags are a low lying broken mountain range on the Rybalkan Peninsula. Most of the wilderness located within the Jagged Crags has not been explored by the Rybalkans.</p>\n<p>The entrance to the Dwarf Realm, Icecrag Monastery, and the location of the rare @UUID[.w79VOo3UeUGraouv#winterflower]{Winterflower} are all rumored to be hidden in these frigid mountain peaks. The crags get their name from the jagged points that jut hundreds of feet into the air throughout the region. Climbing these small mountains is utterly suicidal and unnecessary. There is a reason why this particular region has not been explored.</p>\n<p>The Jagged Crags are dangerous enough for their terrain, but a strange weather phenomenon makes them even more hazardous. During autumn and spring the winds are gusting, which means that periods of calm breezes, lasting for 3d10 minutes, are followed by short busts of strong wind, lasting for 1d10 minutes and reaching up to 50 mph. During the onset of later phases those with strength 13 or less must make successful Strength checks DC 7 to not fall prone, and movement during strong winds is halved. The animal life of the Jagged Crags has adapted to these weather conditions and is thus not affected. Skilled mountaineers do get signs from this though. With a successful Survival check DC 12 they notice seemingly odd animal behavior like birds landing or soaring high, animals burrowing into the earth or snow and even @UUID[.w79VOo3UeUGraouv#oreadian-flower]{oreadean flowers} flattening themselves. Many a would-be-mountaineer was blown from a ledge by a gusting wind, never to be seen again.</p>\n<p>In winter the Jagged Crags are stormy, with blizzards raging for 2d6 hours before a calm but still frosty breeze replaces them. Those calm phases are also longer and can last from a few hours to whole days. With a storm comes a great amount of snow, restricting vision to 10 feet, be it normal, lowlight- or darkvision. The @UUID[.BSbDtCDmgwQBw1co#daggersheep]{daggersheep} still have good movement rates under those condition, letting sages speculate that they have a strange additional sense of orientation.</p>\n<p>In summer the Jagged Crags do explode with life. The snow never leaves the mountain tops entirely, but whole summits are red as blood with blooming @UUID[.w79VOo3UeUGraouv#bloodflower]{bloodflowers}. In lower regions the snow does melt, creating the summer flows through ragged ravines. Oreads are sometimes seen to travel far and wide, collecting the water for the spirits they are supposed to carry. @UUID[JournalEntry.QlctNkzE9injOde9.JournalEntryPage.t4LZuyNruvzneOHD]{Dwarves} also prefer to collect the cold waters, but they do it for their distillery operations. Since those summerflows that flow through the @UUID[.zUmf61j380tilNZt]{Dark Wood} are a preferred home for water nymphs and other feys, sages do agree that there is something special about the flows of summer, but as of now no one seems to have a clue about the details.</p>\n<p>While mountaineering in the Jagged Crags is best done in summer, many agree that it is best not done at all. Even in summer the mornings can be below freezing, but temperatures can rise to almost hot conditions within hours. Wind is between calm and light, but can reach 40 mph occasionally and carry heavy rains, which lower perception to 10 feet except for the aforementioned daggersheeps. During a summer storm, which can last from 15 minutes to an hour (roll 1d4 for 15-minutes increments), there is a chance of 70% per increment that 1d4 lightning bolt strikes near an adventuring party. Determine the victims randomly, but double the chances for members in heavy iron armor or with a pole weapon. Each bolt deals 3d10 points of electricity damage, a reflex save halves that damage. Daggersheep are not immune against this, its not unusal to find a cooked daggersheep somewhere on the Crags in summer. If you saw off a daggerlike horn of such a sheep, you can use it three times as a dagger with the shock special ability (extra 1d6 points of electricity damage), but this also affects the wielder. The lightning is stored for up to three weeks or until spend, whichever comes faster. Harvesting a daggersheep horn deals 1d8 of electricity damage unless protected. This doesn’t count against the shock special ability. A daggersheep horndagger can be reloaded with lightning bolt as by the rules.</p>\n</div>","markdown":""},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"sort":0,"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{"core":{"sheetClass":""}}},{"name":"Rybalka-NPCs","type":"text","_id":"AMC4KKCcHuBgS853","title":{"show":false,"level":1},"image":{},"text":{"format":1,"content":"<div class=\"aventyr\">\n<p class=\"s5\">Rybalka-NPCs</p>\n<h2>Government</h2>\n<p><strong>@UUID[.AMC4KKCcHuBgS853#mayor-igor-leonid]{Mayor Igor Leonid}</strong> – Igor Leonid is the Mayor of @UUID[JournalEntry.ismpCNWpGHvB1iPw]{Rybalka} and originally hails from @UUID[JournalEntry.QVrlu0lTv2vFtT5P.JournalEntryPage.dwAJ5Jtc6ii8zQoh]{Mohkba}, capital city of the @UUID[JournalEntry.QVrlu0lTv2vFtT5P]{Klavek Kingdom}.</p>\n<p><strong>@UUID[.AMC4KKCcHuBgS853#village-guard]{Village Guard}</strong> – The 10 guards who protect the fishing village of Rybalka from the dangers of the wilderness.</p>\n<p><strong>@UUID[.AMC4KKCcHuBgS853#wvolf]{Wvolf of the Village Guard}</strong> – Rybalkan resident long before the Klavek Kingdom ousted the @UUID[JournalEntry.QlctNkzE9injOde9.JournalEntryPage.I4CpK8rTs0HgD7hW]{Vikmordere}.

In his free time, Igor frequents the @UUID[.zpUSPaV4mxOVvVDx#thirsty-serpent-tavern]{Thirsty Serpent Tavern} where the patrons revel in his boisterous, booming singing voice as he leads them in traditional Klavekian songs. He has been known to raise the morale to such great heights that patrons of the tavern often volunteer for guard duty. Rumors persist of a song which the mayor sang upon coming to Rybalka which convinced twenty young men to sign up and serve in the Klavekian military.</p>\n<p>Despite his rough and tumble nature, Igor Leonid upholds the strict laws of the Klavek Kingdom in this cold and forsaken outpost on the edge of Vikmordere territory.</p>\n<p>After defeating the Vikmordere in a bloody war, the village of Rybalka was established and Igor was sent to hold the peace. Igor has a fine record of making peace out of hostility in the Klavek Kingdom and will perform the same way here. He has no fear of battle but prefers negotiation if at all possible. When it comes to negotiation, Igor’s soft-spot is homemade bread pudding, those in the know can exploit this and win his heart by tempting his gluttonous belly.</p>\n<p>The Klavekian Monarchy has assigned Mayor Igor Leonid thirty Klavekian Soldiers which patrol a 15-mile radius around Rybalka.</p>\n<p>Ten Rybalkan soldiers (dubbed the @UUID[.AMC4KKCcHuBgS853#village-guard]{Village Guard} by the locals) have also been appointed to Rybalka under the direct leadership of Mayor Igor Leonid. All have seen war firsthand and are prepared to kill if the Mayor’s rule is resisted in any way.</p>\n<h2>Village Guard</h2>\n<p>The Village Guard is led by @UUID[.AMC4KKCcHuBgS853#mayor-igor-leonid]{Mayor Igor Leonid}.</p>\n<h3>Alex Bladetooth</h3>\n<p>The silent type, Alex is deadly in battle. He keeps his past life a secret and speaks only when spoken to.</p>\n<h3>Barrett Colvek</h3>\n<p>Barrett is a foolhardy adventurer type who drinks too much and is always late for his shifts. He loves his job, but is quite distracted.</p>\n<h3>Derann the Orphan</h3>\n<p>Derann is someone who you would want at your back. He is the first to warn others of danger and is always looking out for the best interests of the Klavek Kingdom.</p>\n<h3>Jells</h3>\n<p>Jells is a roguish type who was once a pickpocket but decided to change his ways and become a Klavekian Guard. The catalyst for this change was his brother’s death at the hands of the Vikmordere during one of their many raids on the Klavek Kingdom.</p>\n<h3>Lexandor Hyrule III</h3>\n<p>Following in his father’s footsteps, Lexandor is noble, arrogant, and rude. Lexandor spends much of his time studying, flaunting his family’s wealth and notoriety, and flirting with women at the local tavern.</p>\n<h3>Nolan Brenweld</h3>\n<p>Nolan comes from a noble family, but unlike Lexandor does not flaunt it. Nolan prefers to keep to himself and works on improving his skills as a warrior. @UUID[.AMC4KKCcHuBgS853#mayor-igor-leonid]{The mayor} has trusted both Nolan and @UUID[.AMC4KKCcHuBgS853#wvolf]{Wolf} with secret missions from time to time and both men are in line for a promotion.</p>\n<h3>Olav Gyutok</h3>\n<p>Olav is a huge man who wades into battle with joy. He loves to crush skulls and make mince-meat of his enemies. Olav has been a guard for over 10 years and plans on defending the Klavek Kingdom until he can no longer heft a sword.</p>\n<h3>Perry Yefim</h3>\n<p>A naturally curious young lad, Perry prefers to stay indoors where it is warm. Perry most times chooses to perform clerical duties while working on his own novel about life on the edge of the untamed wilderness. He performs his rounds quickly and then returns to his writings, hoping to publish a book in the next few years.</p>\n<h3>Valerius Untoo</h3>\n<p>Valerius comes from a family of mages, thus he is the black sheep but does not mind. He has a bit of an inferiority complex, but does a satisfactory job of defending the village. Valerius is having an affair with a local young woman. If the woman’s husband was to find out he would most likely attempt to kill Valerius. Thus, Valerius keeps his “nightly appointments” to himself.</p>\n<h3>Wvolf</h3>\n<p> </p>\n<img style=\"float:right;margin:0px 15px 15px 0px;border:0px\" title src=\"modules/aaw-games-aventyr/Setting-images/Wvolf.webp\" width=\"250\" height=\"323\" />\n<p>Wvolf lived in this region long before the Klavek Kingdom ousted the Vikmordere from Rybalka. He is a lone ranger who for many years made his home among the cold mountain forests that dot the valley around the large glacial lakes.</p>\n<p>When the Klavekians came, @UUID[.AMC4KKCcHuBgS853#mayor-igor-leonid]{Mayor Igor Leonid} met with Wvolf and convinced him that the Klavek Kingdom desired only to hold the village and mine thus retaining peaceful relations with their neighbors.</p>\n<p>Wvolf has agreed to stay on as a member of the @UUID[.AMC4KKCcHuBgS853#village-guard]{Village Guard} and an informant to Mayor Igor Leonid in return for the Klavek Kingdom agreeing to leave specific parts of the wilderness untouched. The location and importance of these areas have not been disclosed to the general public. Official legal documents have been signed and the Klavek Kingdom must uphold this agreement as long as the Klavekian Monarchy holds power in the Vikmordere Valley.</p>\n<p>The mayor has trusted both @UUID[.AMC4KKCcHuBgS853#nolan-brenweld]{Nolan} and Wvolf of the Village Guard with secret missions from time to time. Both men are in line for a promotion.</p>\n<p>It seems that no matter how many years pass Wvolf does not seem to age. This causes many of the villagers to question Wvolf’s lineage. He ignores such gossip, preferring to focus instead on his role in this village. Wvolf keeps to himself and is rarely caught off guard, especially in the wilderness. When he must fight he does so from a distance using his longbow. In close quarters he dual wields two magical shortswords with maniacal fury. Wvolf is a formidable opponent and is rarely bested.</p>\n<h2>The Black Bears</h2>\n<p>The Black Bears are comprised of young yet seasoned veterans of the Klavekian Military who assisted in taking Rybalka from the hands of the Vikmordere. They are foul-mouthed, fearless brutes who until recently were the only force available for hire on the Rybalkan Peninsula. The Black Bears have subsisted on a steady diet of hired jobs and quests for the village of Rybalka and her people.</p>\n<h3>Ieart Bear</h3>\n<p>Ieart Bear, Leader/Head (figurehead) of the Black Bears</p>\n<p>A tall man with a fine looking bastard sword at his side, short cropped black hair, a moustache and goatee, with a patch over one eye.</p>\n<p>Male human Ftr8: CR 8; Size M (6 ft., 1 in. tall)</p>\n<h3>Grunt</h3>\n<p>Muscle of the Black Bears</p>\n<p>A large muscle-covered brute who wields a Greatclub the size of a tree trunk.</p>\n<p>Male human Brb4: CR 4; Size M (5 ft., 11 in. tall)</p>\n<h3>Raven</h3>\n<p>Teeth of the Black Bears</p>\n<p>A petite and vivacious young woman wearing tight black leather knee high boots armed with a sling and several pouches of bullets.</p>\n<p>Female human Drd6</p>\n<h3>Drodan</h3>\n<p>Fully grown black bear animal companion</p>\n<p>Male black bear (animal)</p>\n<h3>Lore</h3>\n<p>Wisdom of the Black Bears</p>\n<p>A man in black robes with a tonsure haircut and a holy symbol hanging around his neck.</p>\n<p>Male human Clr4</p>\n<h3>Rial</h3>\n<p> </p>\n<img style=\"float:right;margin:0px 15px 15px 0px;border:0px\" title src=\"modules/aaw-games-aventyr/Setting-images/Rial-of-the-Black-Bears1-163x300.webp\" width=\"163\" height=\"300\" />\n<p>Eyes (True Leader) of the Black Bears</p>\n<p>A skinny woman with long jet black hair also dressed all in black with a rapier at her side.

Six years later and he is now the youngest High Priest of the God of War in all of the Klavek Kingdom.</p>\n<p>Joining the priesthood at such an early age was the will of his Uncle Siescor after Juriendor’s parents’ untimely death. Uncle Siescor saw a strength and wisdom in the young Juriendor that his father had not. He urged him to take the oath to the God of War and become a member of the church.</p>\n<p>Juriendor swore to make a difference in the world and fight for truth and justice wherever the winds of change blew strongest. Juriendor made a difference wherever he went, solving problems using wise and insightful diplomacy. When diplomacy failed, the God of War summoned courage and strength within Juriendor’s very being which he in turn bestowed upon the other priests. Juriendor proved himself in the church, at the negotiation table, and on the field of battle. After many grueling combats and tactical victories, Juriendor was promoted to High Priest of the God of War.</p>\n<p>A progressive force in a cold and dangerous world, Juriendor has been placed on the frontier of civilization in his first position as High Priest of the God of War at the Rybalka Temple.</p>\n<p>High Priest Juriendor preaches a daily sermon at the Rybalka Temple each morning immediately after sunrise. His six acolytes and two priests assist townsfolk with minor matters, while High Priest Juriendor handles larger religious and moral matters. He assists in steering the village in the proper course of action when dealing with diplomatic neighborly relations. Thus far the High Priest has done an outstanding job and the townsfolk hold him in very high regard.</p>\n<p><em>High Priest Juriendor is available to heal adventurers for the standard costs.</em></p>\n<h2>Yuri Statel</h2>\n<p><em>Sage Yuri Statel is a short man with long white hair.

He also buys and sells minor magical items and weapons for a hefty transaction fee (40-60%).</p>\n<p>Yuri knows the location of many strange alchemy ingredients. He frequently hires adventurers to trek into the nearby forests and retrieve hard to come by plants and herbs.

Any signs of Rybalka rebellion or peace talks with the Vikmordere are reported instantly by Yuri to the Klavek Kingdom. Yuri Statel is just one of many aliases the wizard uses. Even the sage’s closest associates do not know his true name.</p>\n<p><strong>History:</strong> Yuri Statel began his career at a young age as a Cavalier serving the Lion Brigade of King Tokolvor XII. While serving his country in the Great War Yuri was captured by the enemy. They tortured him for over a year before he was rescued by his countrymen. No one knows exactly what happened in that enemy dungeon, but Yuri was changed forever.</p>\n<p>After this event, he returned to the Klavek Capitol of Mohkba. Seeking an audience with King Tokolvor Klavek XII’s son the Prince, he petitioned to become a personal historian of the Klavek Kingdom. During his time serving Prince Klavek, his father King Klavek was mysteriously poisoned. The murderer was never found and Prince Tokolvor Klavek became the current king, King Tokolvor Klavek XIII. (This knowledge is known only to historians serving the monarchy or those Klavekian soldiers old enough to remember such events. Yuri’s role is not suspect as he went by a different alias at the time.)</p>\n</section>\n<h2>Quorron</h2>\n<p> </p>\n<img style=\"float:right;margin:0px 15px 15px 0px;border:0px\" title src=\"modules/aaw-games-aventyr/Setting-images/Quorron.webp\" width=\"188\" height=\"284\" />\n<p>Quorron is the blacksmith in Rybalka and has been so for over thirty years, long before the Klavekians took possession of the lakeside village. @UUID[.AMC4KKCcHuBgS853#mayor-igor-leonid]{Mayor Igor Leonid} keeps a close eye on Quorron, but so far the @UUID[JournalEntry.QlctNkzE9injOde9.JournalEntryPage.RTYoyteEKY7EOhy2]{dweorg} has proven trustworthy and uninterested in local politics. The dwarven blacksmith provides general smithy services including weapons &amp; armor construction and repair. Quorron the Rybalkan Blacksmith is truly an artist when it comes to weapon and armor crafting though he would never admit it. He is a rough and tumble dwarf who hails from the city of Embla (<a href=\"https://adventureaweek.com/shop/rise-of-the-drow-ce/drow-dnd-5e-underdark-adventure-setting/\">Rise of the Drow</a>).</p>\n<p>After learning his trade in Embla, Quorron spent many years in the deep ice caves under the Vikmordere Mountains, meditating and waiting for a vision, he finally heard the @UUID[JournalEntry.dOJJ8mRNTPtoihmF.JournalEntryPage.SjKuUjzrx9TNLn0y]{dwarven god} calling out for him to serve in Rybalka, the village of the Upperworlders adjacent to the Lake of the Great Serpent.</p>\n<section id=\"secret-paGt2zSdRwzUDw3K\" class=\"secret\">\n<p>Quorron never speaks of his homeland to anyone and there are two reasons for this: firstly, as a dweorg dwarf, it is forbidden to reveal one’s homeland to an outsider unless the dwarven homeland is under attack and needs assistance. Secondly, Quorron is an outcast and was banished from his homeland after killing his uncle in a dispute over rights to the family forge.</p>\n</section>\n<p>Quorron has never cared for politics or gossip and believes that “might makes right.” This is why he holds no qualms over the new claim-holders on Rybalka. The Klavekians defeated the Vikmordere (Quorron’s former employers) with brute force. Therefore, with Quorron’s “might makes right” philosophy, the Klavekians have every right to own this land.</p>\n<p>When dealing with customers Quorron is short and to the point, ignoring small talk entirely and working tirelessly to appease his clients.</p>\n<h3>Quorron’s Quests</h3>\n<p>Quorron sometimes hires trustworthy adventurers and mercenaries to perform various quests which typically have something to do with ore, metal, crafting techniques, or his customers’ orders. He is short and to the point when offering up a quest and doesn’t like a lot of questions.</p>\n<h2>Fin Starling</h2>\n<p> </p>\n<img style=\"float:right;margin:0px 15px 15px 0px;border:0px\" title src=\"modules/aaw-games-aventyr/Setting-images/Fin-Starling.webp\" width=\"256\" height=\"423\" />\n<p>Fin Starling owns the @UUID[.zpUSPaV4mxOVvVDx#thirsty-serpent-tavern]{Thirsty Serpent Tavern} and has done so ever since his father passed away last winter.</p>\n<p>A semi-retired adventurer in his late twenties, Fin spent much of his youth traveling the world and getting in (and out of) tight spots. A swashbuckler and “Jack of all trades, master of none”, Fin sometimes made his living in illegitimate ways. He has visited almost every single city, town, and village along the coast of the Klavek Homeland and has even traveled to a few remote islands. He loves to tell tales of his journeys but never speaks of his travels outside the Klavek Kingdom; Fin fears reprisal from the monarchy for “unauthorized &amp; undocumented entry into enemy territory” as well as the crime of “fraternizing with the enemy” as a possible alternative charge.</p>\n<p>Fin is a real ladies man and enjoys flirting and teasing women all the way to the bedroom. Despite this fact, he prefers to stay single. In the past when a woman would get too close, he would pick up and leave town in the blink of an eye. Only time will tell how Fin will handle such an affair when his commitment to the family tavern keeps him grounded in Rybalka.</p>\n<p>Thus far Fin has turned down all advances by @UUID[.AMC4KKCcHuBgS853#claudette-vanderbilt]{Claudette Vanderbilt}. This thoroughly confuses her given her special nature for attracting men. Luckily for Fin he wears a magical ring which protects him from Claudette’s powers. He found the ring in a treasure horde a few years ago but is oblivious to both the nature of the ring and Claudette’s evil powers.</p>\n<p>Since taking over the Thirsty Serpent Tavern from his deceased father, Fin has grown bored and does his best to please patrons while putting on a show to keep himself entertained. He longs to go adventuring again and has thought about selling the tavern; he is prevented from doing so by a promise made to his dying father. Before his father passed away, Fin pledged that he would keep the family business alive. Fin craves his freedom more than anything else and meanwhile gathers any tales of treasure or adventure he can get his hands on.</p>\n<h2>Landore Bugg</h2>\n<p>Landore Bugg is a strange fellow who bundles up in tattered and stained clothing. He meanders around town performing menial maintenance work on the village. Landore is paid by Klavek Kingdom.</p>\n<p>Landore owns a small home in Rybalka which he calls “@UUID[.zpUSPaV4mxOVvVDx#bugg-inn]{Bugg Inn}“. This so-called-inn is packed full of random useless junk that Landore picks up around town while performing work. There are two rooms at the inn which have been cleared out for visitors to rent which helps Landore pay to acquire more junk. Sometimes he makes his way out to Klavekian work sites to collect scrap metal and haul it back to his place to dump in the front yard.</p>\n<p>Landore is constantly chewing and spitting tobacco and stinks horribly of foul body odor.</p>\n<p>Most of the townsfolk steer clear of Landore not wishing to find themselves in a never-ending, one-sided conversation about Landore’s latest acquisition.</p>\n<h2>Sulwotik</h2>\n<p> </p>\n<img style=\"float:right;margin:0px 15px 15px 0px;border:0px\" title src=\"modules/aaw-games-aventyr/Setting-images/Sulwotik.webp\" width=\"201\" height=\"391\" />\n<p>Sulwotik owns the makeshift bar dubbed @UUID[.zpUSPaV4mxOVvVDx#sulwotiks-spirits]{Sulwotik’s Spirits} by the locals.</p>\n<p>Sulwotik was originally a tribal shaman of a large Vikmordere tribe but was told by the @UUID[JournalEntry.dOJJ8mRNTPtoihmF.JournalEntryPage.l22xqVPei8b2u04P]{Ancestor Spirit} to settle here at the lakeside village. When Sulwotik first came to the village it was full of lake craftsmen, tribal fishermen, and woodworkers all of the Ancestor People lineage. Sulwotik was quickly welcomed into their society and given the home of a man who had recently perished due to a serpent attack while fishing the Serpent Lake.</p>\n<p>Keeping his shamanistic rituals paramount, Sulwotik needed to find a way to make a living so that he could purchase food and wood in this new strange life. Thus, he learned the art of distillation and shared his intoxicating beverages with the locals who came to visit his home often. Eventually, his home began to change into a gathering place for the locals to drink and talk. It has existed this way ever since.</p>\n<p>The appeal of a down to earth home style atmosphere with fine stiff drinks greatly appeals to the Rybalkan soldiers. Sulwotik uses the opportunity to slowly introduce them to the culture of the Vikmordere and show them that his people are not the evil demons the Klavekian Monarchy makes them out to be. He does this very cautiously over dozens of visits and tests the waters with each Rybalkan soldier. Sulwotik is a wise man and knows that if his true nature is ever discovered he will most likely be tortured, interrogated, and possibly killed.</p>\n<p>Sulwotik sees the invasion of the Klavek Kingdom as a sign of change which the Ancestor Spirit told him could not be avoided. Now that the Klavekians have arrived it is up to Sulwotik to show them the ways of the forest, the mountain, the lake and the eagle, the beaver, and the bear. Nature is one with life and the Ancestor Spirit drives Sulwotik in all that he does. Sulwotik has erected all of the totem poles throughout Rybalka to fend off evil and give thanks to the Ancestor Spirit and Mother Nature. Many Klaveks have chopped them down and burned them for firewood just to spite Sulwotik.</p>\n<p>For every totem pole burnt, Sulwotik begins carving two more to replace it.</p>\n<section id=\"secret-E9cbnfdL0yaQ2fSF\" class=\"secret\">\n<p>Should the village ever come under attack Sulwotik may summon the Ancestor Spirit to imbue one of his totem poles with spiritual energy transforming it into a Totem Golem to protect the villagers.</p>\n</section>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>Claudette Vanderbilt</h2>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Claudette Vanderbilt is a widow in her mid 40’s with a dark secret.</p>\n<p>Claudette drapes her shapely body in fine black evening gowns, wearing enough jewelry to enhance her aesthetic appearance, but not so much as to appear gaudy. She can usually be found at the @UUID[.zpUSPaV4mxOVvVDx#thirsty-serpent-tavern]{Thirsty Serpent Tavern}, flirting with men half her age. She is quite confident and very charismatic which sometimes scores her a handsome man for the evening. She will only take home visitors to the village and never a resident. The townsfolk often jest about how scary she must look naked since none of her male suitors ever return to town again. Fact is, her suitors are never seen or heard from by anyone, ever.</p>\n<p>Claudette is a widow who has continued along in life just fine without her husband whom she found quite irritating. He was always barking orders at her and putting her down. Eventually Claudette grew tired of the orders and dropped some Laungoroot poison in his favorite rabbit stew. The meal was his last and she has lived happily in solitude ever since.</p>\n<section id=\"secret-Y2yroTkaz4ydE2ht\" class=\"secret\">\n<p>Although quite deranged, Claudette is not insane. She has found great pleasure in forging her own path in the world.</p>\n<p>Many years ago while cleaning the cellar, Claudette found a hidden compartment in the wall. Within the compartment rested the mysterious Tome of Nabid (cursed) and an ancient dagger with runes upon the blade known as the Dagger of Nabid (cursed). The large tome appeared quite ancient with a strange symbol burned into the stitched leather cover. Claudette kept the book hidden from her husband and studied the writings while he was out fishing each day. The tome taught her how to make the poison which she later used to kill him and regain the control he had taken from her the day they were wed. Little does Claudette know, but the tome and dagger are cursed and over time are slowly changing her into a Sea Hag. The change has occurred so gradually that Claudette has no recollection of how or why this happened. By drinking fresh blood drawn by the cursed dagger Claudette is able to keep her attractive appearance and alluring charisma.</p>\n<p>When Claudette brings male suitors to her home, she first tricks them by stripping them naked and tying them to her bed posts. She then proceeds to torture them whilst drinking their blood. If they yield and completely give up hope, she is able to transform them into rats using a witchcraft spell and a very sinister potion, both of which were learned from the evil cursed tome. In this state the creatures cannot remember their former life and must obey Claudette’s orders, understanding but unable to communicate or resist in any way. If one of her suitors fails to yield to her evil ways, she drinks their blood until they pass out and die, then carves up their corpse with the cursed dagger, feeding it to the other rats who take refuge in the cellar and tunnels below.</p>\n<p>Claudette’s ultimate goal is unknown even to her, but if she continues to grow in power and people keep disappearing, she will eventually be found out and will have to retreat to the depths of the Serpent Lake or face a traditional village mob lynching.</p>\n</section>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>Beatrice Sweet</h2>\n<p>Beatrice Sweet is @UUID[.AMC4KKCcHuBgS853#terrance-sweet]{Terrance Sweet’s} wife. Beatrice is in her late 60’s and constantly dreams of her four children who left this land years ago to marry and start families of their own.</p>\n<p>The children leaving has left the elderly couple alone in their large home.</p>\n<p>These days, Beatrice sits quietly knitting and rocking back in forth in her chair all day long by the fire, staring out at the cold lake water lapping at the shore. Every once in a while she gently sets down her needles and yarn and gazes out at the moon as if she were homesick and dreaming of another place she would rather be. She never speaks anymore and has fallen into a deep depression. Her husband Terrance has grown weary of spending time around her. He leaves her to her work and the trail of yarn turns into a long blanket which wanders over her lap, her legs, onto the floor and out into the living room, filling the entire room. When she runs out of one color she picks up another off the mantle and continues to add to the blanket. The blanket is a rainbow of dark and dreary colors which is drowning the living room and the life Terrance and Beatrice once had.</p>\n<h2>Terrance Sweet</h2>\n<p>Terrance is a gruff old man in his 60’s who hails from the old school. He is a fisherman and once slung nets and line for a living to raise his four children.</p>\n<p>The children have all since grown up and moved away, leaving Terrance alone with his wife @UUID[.AMC4KKCcHuBgS853#beatrice-sweet]{Beatrice} who has lost her mind in her old age. She sits quietly knitting and rocking back in forth in her chair all day long by the fire, staring out at the cold lake water lapping at the shore. She never speaks and Terrance has grown weary of spending time with her.</p>\n<p>Terrance spends most of his time outside in his cold shop at his workbench carving wood and repairing old fishing poles and nets. He smokes a pipe he carved himself, and wears an old flat cap to cover his bald spot. The wisps of wavy hair that remain cascade down grasping out at his shoulders. When it grows too long he pulls out a mirror and gives himself a trim. Terrance hums old fishing tunes as he works carving wood and once per evening, goes out on the lake in his old skiff to toss in a line and catch dinner.</p>\n<h2>Cual Beartooth</h2>\n<p> </p>\n<img style=\"float:right;margin:0px 15px 15px 0px;border:0px\" title src=\"modules/aaw-games-aventyr/Setting-images/Cual-Beartooth.webp\" width=\"232\" height=\"350\" />\n<p>Cual Beartooth is the only living man to have taken up residence in the horrific @UUID[.gu6JRkzbpzHfoNf6#dark-wood]{Dark Wood} and survived. His path was not an easy one, and Cual has the physical, mental, and emotional scars to prove it.</p>\n<p>Although he rarely speaks of it, Cual originally hails from the Klavek Homeland. Rybalkans know very little about Cual’s past and he prefers it that way. He migrated to this area long before the Klavekians ousted Rybalka from the Vikmordere, and is an old timer to the Vikmordere Valley. The Vikmordere granted him passage after he bested their strongest warriors in challenges of strength and courage and outsmarted the wisest and most knowledgeable of their shamans.</p>\n<p>After just one week upon arriving in the region, Cual gathered supplies and set up camp in the Dark Wood. On the first night, he was attacked by a horde of vicious monsters and was nearly slain. He would have died were it not for an onslaught of undead headless druidic sorcerers that arrived in order to battle the monsters and subsequently give chase.</p>\n<p>After the monsters and their undead pursuers fled his camp, he heard more creatures closing in on his location. As he began to bleed to death, Cual crawled across the forest floor looking for shelter.</p>\n<p>He finally found a small cave which turned out to be the den of a great bear. The massive bear awoke and grabbed Cual’s body in its great maw. Cual beat at the bear’s mouth and struggled to break free. After an intense struggle, Cual loosened a tooth of the bear and ripped it clean from the jaw of the great beast. Using the tooth as a dagger Cual stabbed again and again at the bear’s face, doing anything he could to stop the maw from crushing his already mangled body. After a horrific struggle, Cual was finally able to plunge the dagger deep enough into an eye socket and wedge it into the beast’s brain. The great bear dropped his limp body and they collapsed together in death, but Cual would not die.</p>\n<p>He awoke the next morning, miraculously still alive and barely clinging to his mortal life. Cual used every ounce of strength within his being and body to lift his head and crawl out of the cave. He managed to find a small stream where he drank but feared the water would leak through the dozens of puncture holes covering his body.</p>\n<p>Amazingly, the water was enough for Cual to gather his strength and return to camp. It was there that he found the body of a slain devil. The devil wore magical gear and armor which Cual plundered. Cual found a small vial containing a sweet smelling water.

The tree growth at the southern border of Edhellond with the Scorchlands is limited due to the lack of usable nutrients in the soil. The eastern border of the Silent Forest is relatively clear of tree growth, as these areas have been cultivated for crops.</p>\n<p>Isolationist, militant, xenophobic, and suspicious, almost nothing is known about the Elves of Edhellond, known to non-Elves as the Silent Forest. Non-Elves are unwelcome and those that refuse to leave are found, eventually, outside the Forest, their bodies savaged and left as a warning to others.</p>\n<p>Non-Elves do not know why the denizens of the Silent Forest have separated themselves from the rest of the world and those few Elves who are caught outside the forest will not answers questions about their history or their homeland even under threat of death. Only the most dire of circumstances will make an Elf divulge information.</p>\n<h1>History</h1>\n<p> </p>\n<img style=\"float:left;margin:0px 15px 15px 0px;border:0px\" src=\"modules/aaw-games-aventyr/Setting-images/Sabriel2.webp\" width=\"256\" height=\"363\" />\n<p>The Elves believe that almost at the Prime Event of the universe, light was created and it spread throughout the heavens, bringing life to countless worlds. As the universe attempted to create balance, darkness was created as well. They believe that these two equal and opposing forces were found in @UUID[JournalEntry.dOJJ8mRNTPtoihmF.JournalEntryPage.leuKpASroHy7r6sn]{Naraneus}, who became the Dark Goddess of the Drow, and her twin sister @UUID[JournalEntry.dOJJ8mRNTPtoihmF.JournalEntryPage.oyFVdicDq8mbjOWw]{Naneth}, who would become the Mother Goddess of the Elves.</p>\n<p>Many centuries ago, when the Silent Forest was still relatively young, the surface Elves and what would become known as the @UUID[JournalEntry.QlctNkzE9injOde9.JournalEntryPage.8HyVcZ70eyhwNJsu]{Drow} lived together, but their increasing numbers were soon going to overwhelm what the forest could provide. Rather than the different factions descending into violence, their deities did in their stead.</p>\n<p>According to the surface Elves, Naraneus began a campaign of war against her sister that was so continuous and all-consuming that when the now-divided groups came to blows, Naraneus ignored the pleas of the Drow to concentrate on her own battles. The Drow, in desperation, turned to other gods, but they didn’t answer the Drow either. The Elves showed no quarter as the Drow had begun the fight and the Drow were forced to flee. The Drow call this The Dismissal. The Elves call it The Banishing.</p>\n<p>After nearly a thousand years, Naraneus broke off her war with Naneth and returned to the Drow, teaching them of the darkness that she represented. Naneth took time to reflect upon the activities of the past thousand years and began teaching her priests and priestesses that if the Elves could not trust their own kin, they couldn’t trust anyone outside their kin.</p>\n<p>Trade relations with the @UUID[JournalEntry.QlctNkzE9injOde9.JournalEntryPage.t4LZuyNruvzneOHD]{Dwarf}, @UUID[JournalEntry.QlctNkzE9injOde9.JournalEntryPage.myrc4omqUaiD3RKZ]{Halfling}, and @UUID[JournalEntry.QlctNkzE9injOde9.JournalEntryPage.lMtTJxWecu1ISdP0]{Gnomes} suddenly ceased. There was no response from envoys sent to the Elves. Even the Orcs had no relations with the Elves. The entire society retreated into Edhellond, turning solely to hunting and agriculture and forsaking any trade with any other races.</p>\n<p>At first, diplomats from various races were simply rebuffed and told to leave the forest with very little information. As the other races sent bolder envoys to the Silent Forest, the envoys returned with even less information and more threats to stay out of Edhellond. Eventually, they stopped returning altogether.</p>\n<p>Knowing that trusting the other races was all but impossible, but understanding that knowledge of the other races activities was important, Patriarch Celeion Taltaur sent some spies to infiltrate the Human and Orc communities and others to keep tabs on the other races. These spies are trained in the art of disguise and use every magical means available to them to remain hidden. These spies are replaced every few years, but they remain hidden within those communities and their information is invaluable.</p>\n<h1>Government</h1>\n<p>Edhellond is a theocracy, ruled by a Matriarch or Patriarch. When the current ruler dies, every Cleric, Paladin, and Monk dedicated to @UUID[JournalEntry.dOJJ8mRNTPtoihmF.JournalEntryPage.oyFVdicDq8mbjOWw]{Naneth} goes into a weeklong meditation. Upon awaking, the member of the clergy that can perform a miracle determined to be from Naneth herself becomes the new Matriarch or Patriarch.</p>\n<p>At the time the Matriarch or Patriarch assumes the throne, they select what is called the Warden. Upon death of the Matriarch or Patriarch, the Warden takes control of the throne until a miracle is produced.</p>\n<p>The current leader, Haewel Birron, became the Matriarch when she brought rain to the fields of crops that border the eastern edge of the forest in a time of great drought. This was unusual because the rain came from inside the forest instead of from the sky. She is married to @UUID[.segjH3vhBwQjfdag#arfindiel]{Arfindiel}, an extremely gifted metalsmith who learned the trade from his ancestors, who learned from the @UUID[JournalEntry.QlctNkzE9injOde9.JournalEntryPage.t4LZuyNruvzneOHD]{Dwarf} before the Banishing.</p>\n<p>A Cleric of Naneth who could have become the Matriarch or Patriarch advises the ruler. The current advisor is @UUID[.segjH3vhBwQjfdag#erilanwen,-advisor-to-the-matriarch]{Erilanwen}, a militaristic Cleric of Maethor Naneth .</p>\n<p>Every Matriarch or Patriarch keeps a Wizard or Sorcerer on his or her staff as well. This spellcaster is usually chosen by the advisor, but may be chosen by the ruler. The current spellcaster is @UUID[.segjH3vhBwQjfdag#tacaeon]{Tacaeon}.</p>\n<h1>Cities</h1>\n<p>There are no cities in Edhellond, though there are the remnants of some outposts that lay in ruins. The Elves learned early on that building structures, such as guard posts or even villages simply gives other races a place to establish a stronghold within the Silent Forest. There are hundreds of campgrounds that are used by the patrols within the Forest, but they contain no buildings and usually only a firepit and a place to pitch a tent if needed.</p>\n<h1>Capital</h1>\n<p>There is no capital, per se, of Edhellond. The closest approximation to a capital is Tal (pronounced tahl), which is a shrine to Naneth that is in the middle of Edhellond. Elven legend states that Naneth appeared to Sabarwen Haeelwa, the first Matriarch of the Elves, and told Sabarwen to begin settling an area around a extremely large maple tree. This area is surrounded by a group of treants who have sworn loyalty to the position of the Matriarch or Patriarch.</p>\n<h1>Patrols</h1>\n<p>Specific patrols watch the borders between Edhellond and the @UUID[Compendium.Aventyr-Campaign-Setting.aventyr-campaign.QVrlu0lTv2vFtT5P]{Klavek Kingdom} to the north, the Scorched Lands to the south, and the uncharted territories to the west. General patrols move throughout Edhellond on a regular basis.</p>\n<p>Patrols through Edhellond consist of roughly a dozen warriors and contains at least one individual proficient in a few languages or that has the ability to cast the tongues spell. These patrols also keep a sharp eye out for any type of shape changing magic for something they can use to help their spies stay hidden.</p>\n<p>Spellcasters in these patrols refrain from large, flashy spells, such as lightning bolt, and prefer to use spells like detect thoughts, cause fear, and most use mind-controlling magic to get invaders to leave and not return. They also use spells that alter memories to get invaders to forget anything they have seen, as well as certain psychoactive fungi that are grown near the sea where Edhellond borders the Scorched Lands.</p>\n<p>Each patrol group has two members who carry horns, which are blown in the event of combat. This sound attracts Elves within hearing range. Two separate members of the party carry scrolls of sending, one of which is used at the same time the horns are blown. This scroll is used to contact the Matriarch and inform her of what is occurring, along with approximate position and the number of enemies.</p>\n<p>When the Matriarch receives a sending, she alerts the @UUID[.segjH3vhBwQjfdag#the-teu-circa-(the-silver-sickles)]{Teu Circa, the Silver Sickles}. If the number of enemies is large or battle turns quickly against the defenders, the Sickles will ride into battle upon permanently hasted dire boars. Each member of the Sickles wears a ring of sending to allow constant communication between the group and the Matriarch.</p>\n<h2>The Teu Circa (The Silver Sickles)</h2>\n<p>The Teu Circa are the personal bodyguards for the Matriarch and the internal police force for Edhellond. This group is made up of eleven members, one of each class. The leader of the Sickles, @UUID[.segjH3vhBwQjfdag#tanna,-leader-of-the-tau-circa]{Tanna }in this case, is always a Paladin of @UUID[JournalEntry.dOJJ8mRNTPtoihmF.JournalEntryPage.oyFVdicDq8mbjOWw]{Naneth}.</p>\n<p>Each member of the Teu Circa owns a dire boar that that member raises from the birth of the boar to be a steed and companion. These boars are permanently hasted and have no fear of carrying their rider into battle. Under no circumstances will a boar of the Sickles carry any other rider.</p>\n<p>Both boars and Sickles serve the Elven ruler until death.</p>\n<h1>Religion</h1>\n<p>Elves are monotheistic, worshipping a dual goddess, @UUID[JournalEntry.dOJJ8mRNTPtoihmF.JournalEntryPage.oyFVdicDq8mbjOWw]{Naneth}. Naneth has two faces that Elves will pray to, depending on their class or their situation. Naneth represents the warming, protective, maternal side of light as Asaya Naneth, the Leaf Mother, while also representing the harsh, destructive side of light as Maethor Naneth, the Warrior Mother.</p>\n<p>Death in Edhellond is a somber event. As the Elves consider each other to be family, regardless of lineage, a death is almost always mourned forest wide. A death in Edhellond is treated with respect, but more so if the deceased was a member of the @UUID[.segjH3vhBwQjfdag#the-teu-circa-(the-silver-sickles)]{Teu Circa} or an important member of Elven society. The most respect is reserved for the Matriarch or Patriarch.</p>\n<p>The funereal rite of the Elves is called “returning to Mother.” It involves wrapping the deceased in leaves, having the body blessed by the Matriarch or Patriarch, and buried beneath the roots of a tree. This allows the body’s decomposition to assist the tree in growing, as the chemicals of the body are taken up by the tree.</p>\n<p>When warfare was more common, the rite of blessing and burial was performed by the closest cleric or paladin of Naneth. As the clerics and paladins did not carry enough leaves to wrap bodies in, they pinned a single leaf to the garments of the deceased and buried them below he nearest tree when time permitted.</p>\n<h1>Ruler</h1>\n<p>The current Matriarch of the Elves of the Silent Forest is Haewel Birron. As per Elven custom, when the previous rule, Patriarch Umiel Firwen, passed away, Haewel joined the other clerics, paladins, and monks in trying to bring forth a miracle to see whom the new leader would be. Haewel managed to conjure rain to bring water to the crops that border the eastern edge of the Silent Forest, but this rain came from inside the forest instead of the sky, marking her as the new ruler of Edhellond. What makes her more unusual is that she is just past middle age, making her the youngest Matriarch in recorded Elven history.</p>\n<p>She is a potent healer, but tempers her healing abilities with common sense; if you are hurt during battle, she is the first to offer aid. However, if your injuries are your own doing from lack of forethought, she will have one of her clerics heal the most grievous wound, but leave the rest to heal on its own.</p>\n<p>Matriarch Haewel is the daughter of a female Cleric of Maethor Naneth and a jeweler.</p>\n<h1>Significant Characters</h1>\n<h2>Tanna, Leader of the Tau Circa</h2>\n<p>Tanna was born in the southern portion of Edhellond to two clerics of <span style=\"font-family:Signika, sans-serif\"><span style=\"color:rgb(25, 24, 19);font-family:Signika, sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-variant-ligatures:normal;font-variant-caps:normal;font-weight:400;letter-spacing:normal;orphans:2;text-align:start;text-indent:0px;text-transform:none;white-space:normal;widows:2;word-spacing:0px;-webkit-text-stroke-width:0px;text-decoration-thickness:initial;text-decoration-style:initial;text-decoration-color:initial;display:inline !important;float:none\">Maethor</span></span> @UUID[JournalEntry.dOJJ8mRNTPtoihmF.JournalEntryPage.oyFVdicDq8mbjOWw]{Naneth}. As she grew, she took to the teachings of her parents, but instead of simply worshipping Naneth, Tanna wanted to show others the glory of the Warrior Mother.</p>\n<p>To do this, she trained as hard as she could, pushing herself past limits she wasn’t aware she had, both physically and spiritually.</p>\n<p>When Tanna was at her physical peak, she became the apprentice to Eenthi, the (then) leader of the Tau Circa. He taught her to trust her mind as well as her heart, teaching her the dirty tricks that other races use and how to counter them. He tempered her spirit with reality. He formed her into the woman she is today; tough, no-nonsense, and practical, but still filled with the wonder of Naneth.</p>\n<p>She has an unwavering loyalty to Matriarch Birron, but places the safety of the Elven lands above even that of the Matriarch and will not hesitate to question decisions made at the throne.</p>\n<h2>Erilanwen, Advisor to the Matriarch</h2>\n<p>Erilanwen is the current advisor to Matriarch Birron and a Cleric of Maethor Naneth.</p>\n<p>Born in Tal, Erilanwen was orphaned at age twenty-five when his parents we killed during a wild bear attack. Before this happened, both of his parents taught him the ways of Asaya Naneth. After the attack, his attitude changed and he found himself gravitation toward Maethor Naneth.</p>\n<p>As he aged, he became a cleric of Maethor Naneth, but found that he retained some of his parents’ teachings regarding Asaya Naneth. While he does still feel anger for his parents being killed, he has tried to find a balance between the two aspects of Naneth within himself. Although he is prone to anger-filled outbursts, he is also capable of great caring and empathy. He tries to lend these qualities in his advisement of the Matriarch.</p>\n<h2>Arfindiel</h2>\n<p>Two things that Elves excel in are magic and art and foremost in Edhellond among goldsmiths is Arfindiel.</p>\n<p>Arfindiel learned goldsmithing from his parents who in turn, learned it from time spent with the @UUID[JournalEntry.QlctNkzE9injOde9.JournalEntryPage.t4LZuyNruvzneOHD]{Dwarf} before the Banishing and the closing of the Edhellian borders.</p>\n<p>Born with a minor talent for magic, Arfindiel surpassed his parents in his talent for manipulating precious metals.</p>\n<p>When he approached Haewel Birron, he brought to her what he considers his greatest work: a holy symbol of Naneth. The leaf is made of copper colored green, with the edges and veins of the leaf made of platinum. The arrow is made from pieces of one of Haewel’s own arrows, the arrowhead made from pure gold and fletching made of silver. She carries it to this day as her own holy symbol.</p>\n<p>Arfindiel stays out of the politics that his wife is engaged with. He prefers to stay out of the limelight and create new artistic pieces.</p>\n<h2>Tacaeon</h2>\n<p>Tacaeon is young, barely into adulthood. His age and enthusiasm belies his sorcerous abilities.</p>\n<p>His magic appeared to Tacaeon very early, as he was passing into his thirties. Instead of settling down with a tutor, of which there were many, Tacaeon’s parents encouraged him to practice his own. He took to magic as the proverbial duck to water.</p>\n<p>Tacaeon has a small workshop near Tal that he calls his “hutch.” Inside, he is almost constantly experimenting, a sign indicating such is hung on the door of the hutch.</p>\n<p>Haewel chose him as her advisor due to his age. As everyone around her has the experience of many years, most of them have lost Tacaeon’s fresh, unadulterated view of the world.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n</div>","markdown":""},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"sort":0,"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{"monks-enhanced-journal":{"appendix":false},"core":{"sheetClass":""}}}],"_stats":{"systemId":"dnd5e","systemVersion":"2.1.4","coreVersion":"10.291","createdTime":1663485627864,"modifiedTime":1675658459788,"lastModifiedBy":"EsIYTtNnjwxUbKOG"},"_id":"wVQiwLZtRuaqbpFA","ownership":{"default":0,"R5IsvMTH5P79pBoG":3},"folder":"j9cXBagzZ1ARsO2I","sort":1400000},{"name":"Timaeus","pages":[{"name":"Timaeus","type":"text","_id":"hnQDgK0SceEGQoUn","title":{"show":false,"level":1},"image":{},"text":{"format":1,"content":"<div class=\"aventyr\">\n<p class=\"s5\">Timaeus</p>\n<img style=\"display:block;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto\" src=\"modules/aaw-games-aventyr/Setting-images/TIMAEUS-750x539.webp\" width=\"489\" height=\"474\" />\n<p>To the outside world, Timaeus looks like an idealistic place. Every man, woman and child has magical talent, their military is a precision machine, and they are ruled over by the wisest and most powerful wizards in the known world—the Obelisk Order. However appearances aren’t everything, and like many perfect things, its interior tells another story entirely.</p>\n<p>Timaeus is mostly a peaceful place due to a perpetual military presence and because the citizenry lives under the constant fear of the living dead, as well as a government that keeps both the populace and their soldiers in check. Secrets are not to be spoken aloud, and any troublemakers or revolutionaries are quickly tracked down and executed.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<img style=\"float:left;margin:0px 10px 10px 0px;border:0px\" src=\"modules/aaw-games-aventyr/Setting-images/Final-Eventual-c-gary-dupois-timaen-mage-232x300.webp\" width=\"232\" height=\"300\" />\n<p>It is true that every natural-born citizen of Timaeus is taught magic as early as they can read, but this is done both out of desperation as it is out of inborn talent; any children who reach the age of eight without proof of magical ability are stolen from their homes, never to be seen again. Though no more than one in a dozen youths is taken this way, many mothers make deals with planar creatures and outsiders just to ensure their child has magical potential.</p>\n<p>Likewise, the military has proven itself to be exceptional—for nearly a thousand years it has been in a perpetual war against the undead surging from the deadlands and the army shows little sign of wearing thin. Yet despite this bravery, the country is fragmented into six orders, six armies struggling for control against both the undead and one another—instead of uniting as a unified force.</p>\n<p>Worst of all is the Obelisk Order themselves. When they stopped the shard of the sun they were unarguably the most powerful and wisest wizards in the world; but that was centuries ago and in that time they have calcified, becoming shells of their former selves who can do nothing but continue their eternal ritual. Without the clear guiding force of the Obelisk Order themselves, Timaeus borders on self-destruction. As the leaders of the six armies become increasingly obsessed with the minutiae of citizens everyday life for the slightest advantage over the others, they become ever blinder to the dangers massing both within and without the country’s borders.</p>\n<h1>History</h1>\n<p><strong>Year –813:</strong> The Timaeus Academy is founded by six explorer-wizards that feel the ley-lines at the site were extroardinary and would encourage magical growth amongst students of magic.</p>\n<p><strong>Year –784</strong>: The city of @UUID[.OYj59KJky98HgcM7#maeus]{Maeus} is settled around the Timaeus Academy.</p>\n<p><strong>Year –731:</strong> As settlers expand through the brushlands, more and more children are born with magical talents until eventually, nearly every citizen of the nation develops magical powers.</p>\n<img style=\"float:right;margin:0px 10px 10px 0px;border:0px\" src=\"modules/aaw-games-aventyr/Setting-images/Academic-Town-Color-F-245x300.webp\" width=\"245\" height=\"300\" />\n<p><strong>Year –598:</strong> Feuds between the masters of the Timaeus Academy lead to the devastating Campaign of Roses, killing thousands. The remaining masters build an obelisk in the courtyard of the academy as a memorial, naming themselves the Obelisk Order so they will never forget the dangers of untapped magic.</p>\n<p><strong>Year –219:</strong> The Black Halls appears from out of nowhere, within sight of Maeus.</p>\n<p><strong>Year –1:</strong> @UUID[.EVR6caNc4jmcLjmb]{Mek’Madius} is cast out of the Obelisk Order.</p>\n<p><strong>Year 0:</strong> The Obelisk Order send the Shard of Sun into orbit rather than allowing it to crash into and destroy Aventyr. The resulting ritual levels the original Timaeus Academy, killing dozens of promising wizards and destroying thousands of years of arcane knowledge. Energy released by the event alters the local geography, creating the Scorched Lands to the west and the @UUID[.OYj59KJky98HgcM7#the-deadlands]{deadlands} that will come to define the northern border of Timaeus.</p>\n<p><strong>Year 16:</strong> @UUID[.hnQDgK0SceEGQoUn#the-six-orders]{Six orders} are founded, one for each remaining member of the Obelisk Order. Their leaders look entirely to one member of the order for guidance however with each annual ritual that passes, they are more difficult to reach and their responses become shorter and more cryptic.</p>\n<p><strong>Year 108:</strong> The undead surge forth from the deadlands, razing cities and destroying the countryside as they go. @UUID[.uPbpU972uzF4TxuE#the-order-of-the-blade]{The Order of the Blade} mounts the first Warmblooded Campaign to drive the undead back into the deadlands, establishing four border fortresses in so doing.</p>\n<p><strong>Year 391:</strong> The undead again surge from the deadlands, showing amazing cognitive ability as they overtake each of the border fortresses one at a time, almost entirely eliminating the @UUID[.uPbpU972uzF4TxuE#the-order-of-the-blade]{Order of the Blade} in a defeat now known as the Red Plague.</p>\n<p><strong>Year 393:</strong> The Second Warmblooded Campaign begins the grueling task of driving the undead back north, into the deadlands. Martial Law is declared and the military @UUID[.uPbpU972uzF4TxuE#the-order-of-the-shield]{Order of the Shield} takes official control of the country.</p>\n<p><strong>Year 418:</strong> The Second Warmblooded Campaign succeeds in freeing most of northern Timaeus from the grasp of the undead.

The shamed order is ousted by the newly rebuilt @UUID[.uPbpU972uzF4TxuE#the-order-of-the-blade]{Order of the Blade}, who take the offensive into the deadlands to put down the growing threat.</p>\n<p><strong>Year 497:</strong> @UUID[.uPbpU972uzF4TxuE#the-order-of-the-blade]{The Order of the Blade} proves that at least some of the undead raised within the deadlands cannot be permanently destroyed by any known means. In an effort to prevent another Red Plague they begin a practice that lasts to this day of daily raids into the deadlands to destroy any unliving blight they see.</p>\n<p><strong>Year 901:</strong> In an effort to raise dwindling morale and reduce growing bureaucracy, the Order of the Blade raises all @UUID[.uPbpU972uzF4TxuE]{six orders} back to equal status once more. Though their goals remain the same as they once did, each is now little more than a specialized military unit. Martial law and waves of forced enlistment remain an uncontested fact of everyday life for all but those with the longest memories.</p>\n<h1>Timean Naming</h1>\n<p>Though popular names vary widely from year to year, nearly all Timean given names are two distinct syllables.

They all promote from entirely within their own ranks, and each jang chooses their own successors personally—often establishing their replacements decades before they intend to need one in case of an untimely “accident”.</p>\n<p>Though the organizational structure of each order is different, they have all been known to hire mercenaries and assassins from outside the country both publicly and clandestinely (to accomplish deeds they do not want to be associated with doing themselves).</p>\n<h2>The Order of the Rose</h2>\n<p> </p>\n<img style=\"float:right;margin:0px 10px 10px 0px;border:0px\" src=\"modules/aaw-games-aventyr/Setting-images/order-of-the-rose-300x300.webp\" width=\"231\" height=\"231\" />\n<p>The most diverse of the orders, its leader @UUID[.UPVEdWjUv9JYfjX1#nanmin-jun]{Sojang Nan’Min-Jun} manages dozens of subordinates each of whom oversees magical distribution and use amongst one or more trades and professions across the country. He is a patient man but has a terrible temper when provoked, and he insists that all contracts be signed in blood, openly carrying a special bloodletting knife with him at all times to ensure such a rite is always carried out.</p>\n<p>Min-Jun also manages all imports and exports from the country—which is little. Timaeus primarily acquires few foreign goods (only a small amount of food) and publicly trades nothing though secretly, they do sell the occasional skyship or magical weapon to those wealthy enough to afford it. The Order of the Rose also serves as the country’s semi-underground information network. They encourage both loyalty and fear amongst the populace, requiring under fear of punishment that people report unusual amounts of magical usage from their friends and neighbors—or any other suspicious activity. Information about those who are potentially misusing their magic or otherwise might be troublemakers is typically passed to the Order of the Cloak, who then act on information that proves reliable.</p>\n<h2>The Order of the Staff</h2>\n<img style=\"float:right;margin:0px 10px 10px 0px;border:0px\" src=\"modules/aaw-games-aventyr/Setting-images/order-of-the-staff-67x300.webp\" width=\"67\" height=\"300\" />\n<p>The official mandate of the Order of the Staff is to oversee and improve the arcane schools across Timaeus, a duty which the order has performed with stellar efficiency for generations. However, the order’s control extends far beyond simple magical knowledge—they strive to control all information both within and without the country.</p>\n<p>Their leader, @UUID[.UPVEdWjUv9JYfjX1#longkai-kyun]{Hanjang Long’Kai-kyun}, manages this task first by throttling information that the citizens of Timaeus receive. Educational programs available to the common citizen stress loyalty to the six orders, the flawlessness of their leaders, and the chaos and evil of the world outside Timean borders. Though Kai-Kyun is undoubtedly a genius when it comes to information, he is absolutely useless when it comes to dealing with people. He squirrels himself away in a library nearly all of every day, emerging only to review the decisions made by his six trusted sangjwa’s (pronounced “sane-wah”) who head the six major academies, one of which is Timaeus Academy itself.</p>\n<p>To keep out false knowledge the order maintains a fierce presence in every port town and landing, upholding a strict policy on border crossings—namely that as little of it happens as possible. Total isolation is beyond their reach, however, so instead they sell trade and travel permits to foreigners (so long as they don’t appear to be spreading false messages of the government or the outside world) and hire them as mercenaries for the Order of the Blade.</p>\n<p>Despite the overall quality of the schools run by the Order of the Staff, few outside those who join the order are ever allowed access to them. Those not born within Timaeus must pay a small fortune each year to be allowed to study within any of their hallowed halls, and those who are must pledge their life in the order’s service.</p>\n<h2>The Order of the Wand</h2>\n<img style=\"float:right;margin:0px 10px 10px 0px;border:0px\" src=\"modules/aaw-games-aventyr/Setting-images/order-of-the-wand-300x300.webp\" width=\"219\" height=\"219\" />\n<p>As long as there have been opinions, there have been those who force them upon others. Nowhere is this less true than the Order of the Wand, who constantly monitor the population for any sign of general distress before working to quiet it—by any means necessary. What this usually means, however, is that they spread propaganda, stage fake uprisings elsewhere, or otherwise seed the population with the false idea that nothing is wrong, or that acting on anything they feel is wrong will not end well.</p>\n<p>Any major operation is led directly by @UUID[.UPVEdWjUv9JYfjX1#mikmin-hei]{Sojang Mik’Min-Hei} herself; she has always been a master of making people see things her way, though on the exterior she rarely gives off even a sliver of emotion herself.</p>\n<p>When dealing with smaller-scale operations that focus only the removal of one or two targets they typically defer to the @UUID[.uPbpU972uzF4TxuE#the-order-of-the-cloak]{Order of the Cloak}, and they encourage citizens to speak to the @UUID[.hnQDgK0SceEGQoUn#the-order-of-the-rose]{Order of the Rose} instead of themselves. Though it is a rarity to see their agents in action, the Order of the Wand does employ a number of specialized evokers and enchanters to perform operations themselves when no other alternative is available.</p>\n<h2>The Order of the Shield</h2>\n<img style=\"float:right;margin:0px 10px 10px 0px;border:0px\" src=\"modules/aaw-games-aventyr/Setting-images/Drekons-Kite-Shield1-copy-162x300.webp\" width=\"162\" height=\"300\" />\n<p>The longest-standing military order in Timaeus, they control the majority of the country’s navy as well as a small fleet of skyships (alongside other mobile units) capable of crossing the ocean or the deadlands at any time in defense of the country. Officially, the Order of the Shield is also a religious order who worship a variety of deities, notably amongst them @UUID[Compendium.Aventyr-Campaign-Setting.aventyr-campaign.dOJJ8mRNTPtoihmF.JournalEntryPage.zNH5DtHDKD52Ufaf]{Onael}, @UUID[Compendium.Aventyr-Campaign-Setting.aventyr-campaign.dOJJ8mRNTPtoihmF.JournalEntryPage.QiPqpoNg3jLKKBlu]{Hado} and Xio—gods of law and of war. The order’s daejang takes this devotion to the pantheons of combat extremely seriously, and Il’Mad-Kyun is considered a zealot by most and a bully by all.</p>\n<p>Mad-Kyun has done an effective job at keeping external threats at bay with his posturing and regular threats against any nation near enough to listen; he’s been known to threaten to adjust the Obelisk Order’s ritual just enough to shift the location of the Scorched Lands so that it destroys anyone who might oppose him or Timaeus. None are sure if he actually has this power, but it is certain that if he were to do such a thing, much of the world would unite against Timaeus to prevent Aventyr’s destruction at the hands of a madman. Despite Mad-Kyun’s bizarre fanaticism, he also cares deeply for his pets and those under his command he is directly responsible for. He has half-dozen servants each for his horse, his battle-turtle, and his wolf-hound, all of whom must be ready for battle at a moment’s notice.</p>\n<h2>The Order of the Blade</h2>\n<img style=\"float:right;margin:0px 10px 10px 0px;border:0px\" src=\"modules/aaw-games-aventyr/Setting-images/sword-rick-h3-128x300.png\" width=\"128\" height=\"300\" />\n<p>The country’s second standing army, the Order of the Blade, exists solely to handle internal threats. Primarily they fight the undead from the @UUID[.OYj59KJky98HgcM7#the-deadlands]{deadlands} but they are also responsible for managing banditry and natural beasts of all kinds. They are led by @UUID[.UPVEdWjUv9JYfjX1#haikal-sean]{Daejang Hai’Kal-Sean}, a bastion of honesty and loyalty within a government known to be self-serving. He fights to protect the people the best he can and is seemingly tireless in his efforts. He sees law and goodness as inseparable, and any who seek to undermine the law are perceived as evil no matter the reason.</p>\n<p>Though the order is led by battle wizards and other combat focused mages, the Order of the Blade is the most diverse of the six orders. They have units of wizards, entire companies of immigrant mercenaries, and most interestingly, companies who must fight without the aid of any magic at all, accompanied by battle-tortoises equipped with 10 ft. tall crystals that radiate antimagic. These antimagical units are officially intended to fight rogue spellcasters and army deserters, yet whispers abound that these are the kidnapped children that lack any magical talent of their own.</p>\n<h2>The Order of the Cloak</h2>\n<img style=\"float:right;margin:0px 10px 10px 0px;border:0px\" src=\"modules/aaw-games-aventyr/Setting-images/cloak-rich-h1-144x300.png\" width=\"144\" height=\"300\" />\n<p>The most secretive of the cabals that rule the country, the Order of the Cloak doesn’t have a visible presence in Timaeus and instead works through spies, assassins, and covert agents within the other orders. Despite this, their actions are easily recognized and whenever a person is found mysteriously dead or missing, none doubt who is responsible. To outside inquirers they are led by @UUID[.UPVEdWjUv9JYfjX1#koamin-jin]{Bimiljang Ko’Amin-Jin}, a patient and arguably evil woman who wears a mask and black cloak when out in public. Yet it is rumored that Amin-Jin, and thus the entire order, takes her orders from some other entirely secret, true jang not known outside the upper echelon of the order—perhaps one as alien as the black halls where Amin-Jin is frequently seen.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<h1>Timaen Terminology</h1>\n<p>While the Timean military is structured similarly to militaries elsewhere in the world, they use uncommon naming conventions.</p>\n<h4><strong>Jang (“yang”)</strong> The general and leader of an order.

Some of these include The Festival of Darkness—celebrated on the day the Shard of the Sun is furthest from Aventyr, 140 days after The Shedding—and the Rain of Petals, which celebrates the greatness of the six jangs.</p>\n<h1>The Shedding</h1>\n<p>Once each Shard Year the Obelisk Order perform a ritual to channel energy from five huge crystals surrounding @UUID[.n71mdJTU3DzXqram#the-pentagram]{The Pentagram}, sending a visible pillar of light up into the sky to strike the Shard of the Sun in an explosive event known as The Shedding. During the Shedding even the safest areas within the deadlands become utterly uninhabitable as raw energy rains from the sky. This energy (known as sun magic) is later collected and used to charge the crystal pillars once again—and much more besides.</p>\n<p>Despite the devastation (which is very localized, mostly to the Scorched Lands), this event is celebrated akin to the new year with all fervor and excess usually associated with annual holidays of renewal—one of the few days of the year that such excitement is encouraged by the six orders. Huge feasts are conjured and made freely available to anyone within any of Timaeus’ major cities, foreigners and citizens are allowed to mingle (though not entirely freely), and merchants and craftsmen of all sorts migrate into the cities (which are normally followed by a week of major mercantile activity across the country).</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>Sun Magic</h2>\n<img style=\"float:left;margin:0px 10px 10px 0px;border:0px\" src=\"modules/aaw-games-aventyr/Setting-images/Sun-stock-art-modified-224x300.png\" width=\"201\" height=\"269\" />\n<p>Sun magic is a remnant of @UUID[.n71mdJTU3DzXqram#the-shedding]{The Shedding}, energy so dense that it takes physical form as a glowing orange liquid hot enough to burn unprotected skin. With careful preparation, however, it can be handled safely, charged into prepared crystals which other magical devices use as power. Though it can be found in the Scorched Lands where the magic of the obelisk ritual connects with the Shard, the rain of magic continues across the ocean into the deadlands and across northern Timaeus (and even further east into the ocean).</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>The Tortoise Migration</h2>\n<p>The day after @UUID[.n71mdJTU3DzXqram#the-shedding]{The Shedding}, the massive crystals are taken from the perimeter of the @UUID[.n71mdJTU3DzXqram#the-pentagram]{Pentagram} and loaded onto trains of tortoises to begin their journey across the countryside to collect the fallen sun magic. The beginning of this migration is seen with much fanfare, as it is never known exactly how long the tortoises will be away from the city for (though it is rarely less than half a year). In addition to the five heavily guarded crystal tortoises, dozens if not hundreds of more mundane merchants and travelers begin their own, lesser migrations across the countryside. Many of them ride tortoises of their own that are similar to the crystal tortoises, complete with large crystals destined to be charged with @UUID[.n71mdJTU3DzXqram#sun-magic]{sun magic} and then reforged into magical items and weapons.</p>\n<h2>Giant Tortoises</h2>\n<p>Huge tortoises have been native to Timaeus since the original wizards settled here. Over the generations, they have been largely domesticated—though it still takes great effort to raise and train one to properly take a rider. They are commonplace amongst the orders but demand exorbitant prices elsewhere, easily thousands of gold pieces at bare minimum; this price is only logical, however, as it takes nearly five years for a hatched tortoise to reach the physical and mental maturity required to carry a rider, and the beasts can live for hundreds of years. The oldest known tortoise is over 400 years old and lives in a comfortable pen in one of the magical academies in Maeus.</p>\n<h2>The Pentagram</h2>\n<p> </p>\n<img style=\"float:right;margin:0px 10px 10px 0px;border:0px\" src=\"modules/aaw-games-aventyr/Setting-images/p04-pentagram-sade-300x290.webp\" width=\"226\" height=\"218\" />\n<p>All that remains of the original Timaeus Academy, this massive pentagram is effectively frozen in time, protected by powerful magic. Without extensive protection, one cannot even approach the Pentagram itself, where the Obelisk Order continues their perpetual ritual to keep the Shard of the Sun’s orbit stable. Nearly a hundred feet outside the Pentagram are five large pits home to huge, charged crystals that multiply in number as the time for @UUID[.n71mdJTU3DzXqram#the-shedding]{the Shedding} draws near, marking the border of where it is safe to approach without magical defenses.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<h1>Timean Religion</h1>\n<p>Unlike so much else in Timaeus, citizens are allowed to freely worship any god they choose so long as they do not disrupt the flow of society around them. Despite this freedom, much of the country praises gods of magic and warfare—the aspects that touch their everyday lives. The most commonly worshipped deity is @UUID[JournalEntry.dOJJ8mRNTPtoihmF.JournalEntryPage.o7Bl7XnxenERvjAq]{Xio}, the Eternal Combatant. The people pray to him daily to keep the war at the fringes, so that their warriors may someday go to join the battle, rather than the battle come to them.</p>\n</div>","markdown":""},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"sort":1100000,"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}},{"name":"Timean Technology","type":"text","_id":"W0FN1UQoEGs8vYzZ","title":{"show":false,"level":1},"image":{},"text":{"format":1,"content":"<div class=\"aventyr\"><p class=\"s5\">Timean Technology</p><img style=\"float:right;margin:0px 10px 10px 0px;border:0px\" src=\"modules/Aventyr-Campaign-Setting/Setting-images/Image_Portfolio_107_Fantasy-Jason-Walton-67-126x300.jpg\" width=\"126\" height=\"300\" /><p>Populated by wizards and literally overflowing with magic, Timaeus boasts many incredible and unusual advances in both science and magic, their discoveries far advancing many others elsewhere in Aventyr. Some of these inventions have become commonplace throughout the world (such as the interposing hand series of spells) whereas others are merely commonly known (like the skyships), while some are far-flung rumors far beyond where they are invented (unique constructs are a common example but there are numerous others). While most of these creations are magical in nature, some are entirely technological—for instance, firearms, while still rare, are an accepted part of life within Timaeus.</p><p>@UUID[.uPbpU972uzF4TxuE]{The six orders}, especially the @UUID[.uPbpU972uzF4TxuE#the-order-of-the-staff]{Order of the Staff}, keep a close eye on civilians developing new technologies and have been known to regularly confiscate or destroy anything that might be too dangerous (a questionable practice that has been the source of no small bit of derision from the more liberal-minded mages). Despite the routine destruction of small villages or devastation wrought by experimentations gone awry, the people accept the practice without much complaint; those that do not quickly find themselves in the sights of the orders.</p><h2>Skyships</h2><p>Known as airships, skyshells, and by countless of other monickers, skyships are found almost exclusively within the Timean capital of Maeus where the power to keep them airborne is most readily available. Typically crafted from the shells of gigantic tortoises reinforced by magic, common skyships are 60 ft. long and hold a crew of four comfortably. Far larger ones do exist, of course, that can hold hundreds of soldiers at once—though all such vessels are currently based within the @UUID[.uPbpU972uzF4TxuE#the-order-of-the-shield]{Order of the Shield’s} imposing armory. Most skyships are able to travel about three times as fast as a man can run (180 ft. speed), though as larger airships exist so do faster ones. The fastest one known to exist was known as The Tera-Bolt, which could travel faster than the eye could see; however, it disappeared over twenty years ago and hasn’t been seen since.</p><table style=\"width:100%;height:730.953px\" border=\"1\"><tbody><tr style=\"height:28.2188px\"><td style=\"background-color:rgb(0, 0, 0);width:99.8714%;height:28.2188px\" colspan=\"6\">&lt;<span style=\"color:rgb(255, 255, 255)\"><span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">Statistics for Dungeons &amp; Dragons 5th Edition</span></span></td></tr><tr style=\"height:666.297px\"><td style=\"background-color:rgb(247, 141, 167);width:99.8714%;height:666.297px\" colspan=\"6\"><h3>Black Arrow</h3><p>Long, narrow, and entirely black, a Black Arrow is an exceptionally uncommon ship in the Timean air force.

While the land isn’t quite as blasted and desolate as it is to the west, the deadlands remain a dry and dangerous place—particularly where the @UUID[JournalEntry.wVQiwLZtRuaqbpFA]{Silent Forest} to the north suddenly ends in a line of dry scrub and withered trees, all of which are thick with undead that appear utterly indestructible.</p>\n<img style=\"margin:0px 10px 10px 0px;border:0px;float:right\" src=\"modules/aaw-games-aventyr/Setting-images/goblin_dog_bg__matt_bulahao-deadlands-timaeus-300x225.webp\" width=\"259\" height=\"194\" />\n<p>The deadlands define Timaeus’ northern and only, land-based border, and they find little objection from the elves that they claim the land as theirs—the lithe folk are happy enough to grant the country of mages their isolation without complaint. Though the blasted sands technically border the Silent Forest to their north, the undead within seem to have a particular hatred of Timaeus and surge south in unending waves, forcing large armies to field just keep the hordes at bay. These armies are primarily stationed around four border fortresses: two of which have been recovered and remade from the first Warmblooded Campaign, and two of which have been rebuilt larger and stronger after their respective destructions. Despite the danger of such an endeavor, some few trading routes through the region persist, heavily patrolled by members of the @UUID[.uPbpU972uzF4TxuE#the-order-of-the-blade]{The Order of the Blade} and @UUID[.uPbpU972uzF4TxuE#the-order-of-the-rose]{The Order of the Rose}</p>\n<h3>Kuchang</h3>\n<p>Visible for miles around because of the titanic obsidian slab that shadows the town, this settlement is the only well known, living collection of humanoids within the deadlands. Kuchang serves as a trading post for what little commerce exists between Timaeus and the @UUID[JournalEntry.wVQiwLZtRuaqbpFA]{Silent Forest}—mostly importing food in exchange for charged sun crystals. Save for a few days of the year around @UUID[.n71mdJTU3DzXqram#the-shedding]{The Shedding}, the town is sheltered from the worst of the Sun Shard’s magic by the thick slab of stone looming overhead, and protected from the undead by swarms of tiny golems. For the week on either side of the Shedding, the settlement is populated only by reanimates and constructs—beings safe from the fatal energy that rains from the sky.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Nyamo\">Nyamo</span></h2>\n<p>A port town founded long before Timaeus’ self-imposed isolation, this city sees a great deal of travel by those passing around Cape Fin. Nyamo is defined by the titanic wall down its center, separating the city into two parts—one for the Timean citizens, and the other where travelers and merchants may land and trade. Passage through the singular, huge gate is strictly regulated by the @UUID[.uPbpU972uzF4TxuE#the-order-of-the-staff]{The Order of the Staff}, but rumors persist of catacombs beneath the city used by smugglers of both goods (and more dangerously, ideas). For more detail see @UUID[.iUOrRhLyDdg71ghA]{Nyamo}</p>\n<h2>Maeus</h2>\n<p>The capital of Timaeus is constructed unlike nearly any other city on Aventyr, with the most developed areas around the border of the city, and the least desirable and dilapidated areas towards to the center with each tier of buildings approaching @UUID[.n71mdJTU3DzXqram#the-pentagram]{the Pentagram} seeing more and more wear.</p>\n<h2>Wyosani</h2>\n<p>What was formerly a salt mine has exploded into a prosperous mining city when 40 years ago they broke into an undiscovered series of caverns beneath their existing mines, containing titanic crystals of the sort used across the nation for crystalline items. The depths of these new caverns have yet to be fully explored or plumbed, but they have been searched for decades now seemingly without end (though rumblings can often be felt deeper below, prompting fears of a response from the Underworld).</p>\n<h2>Opongi Range</h2>\n<p>These large, white, almost cubic mountains have dominated western Timaeus for longer than the lands have been settled. Some believe they are the bones of a god or other ancient and titanic creature—others say they are abandoned alien structures riddled with never-used chambers to scale with the mountains themselves—but explorers that trek there rarely return to confirm any of these rumors.</p>\n<h2>Mek’Madius’ Plateau</h2>\n<p>Though few know the actual location of his lair, the locals rightly believe this steppe is the home of the seventh (exiled) member of the Obelisk Order—the lich @UUID[.EVR6caNc4jmcLjmb]{Mek’Madius}. The Timean government give the mountain a wide berth, though adventurers and treasure-hunters do occasionally strike out towards the plateau, and some have later returned to bring torment to the towns they had visited preparing for their journey.</p>\n<h2>Thick Isles</h2>\n<p>Not officially settled by Timaeus, these islands are each dominated by a volcanic mountain surrounded by thick and supposedly untamable jungle, much of which is inhabited with dangerous and strange creatures. Despite these obvious challenges, the islands are a regular harbor for fugitives and rebels fighting against the Timean government and each holds a handful of heavily armed camps along its shores. Some even claim to have made alliances with the insectoid natives (creatures that call themselves dromites and have strange powers over the mind).</p>\n<h2>Cape Fin</h2>\n<p> </p>\n<img style=\"margin:0px 10px 10px 0px;border:0px;float:left\" src=\"modules/aaw-games-aventyr/Setting-images/animated_object__eric_quigley-300x220.webp\" width=\"300\" height=\"220\" />\n<p>The peninsula jutting south off Timaeus towards Picollo is home to many harbors; with the exception of @UUID[.OYj59KJky98HgcM7#nyamo]{Nyamo} they are barred and magically protected from all foreign traffic.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h2><span id=\"The_Hanne\">The Hanne</span></h2>\n<p>Nearly separating the country in two, the Hanne River flows southwest and northeast before turning south again into the ocean.

Most people today give the enigmatic building a wide berth but the @UUID[.uPbpU972uzF4TxuE#the-order-of-the-shield]{The Order of the Shield} (and some say the@UUID[.uPbpU972uzF4TxuE#the-order-of-the-cloak]{The Order of the Cloak}) use it as a prison for particularly dangerous convicts, having long discovered the magical incantations to seal or unseal nearly any door and window in the building.</p>\n<h3><span id=\"Everyday_Wonders\">Everyday Wonders</span></h3>\n<p>Even the poorest citizen of Timaeus has the advantage of Timaeus’ excess of magic. Eternally flaming crystals stand on tall posts every 50 ft. along each major road, as well as at intersections of smaller roads. Wells that produce their own water (known as everwells) can be found interspersed around the city, some able to produce hot or cold water on demand.</p>\n<h3><span id=\"Traveling_Houses\">Traveling Houses</span></h3>\n<p>Typically small, these buildings are in high demand where they exist. They maintain permanent magic portals to all other traveling houses throughout @UUID[.OYj59KJky98HgcM7#maeus$1]{Maeus} and specialize in teleportation to related guilds and structures across the country of Timaeus.</p>\n<h3><span id=\"New_Timaeus_Academy\">New Timaeus Academy</span></h3>\n<p>A sprawling affair that dominates an entire spoke of the city stretching from the @UUID[.OYj59KJky98HgcM7#old-timeaus-academy]{Old Timeaus Academy} all the way to the edge of the city, this institution is constantly bustling with activity. It serves not only as an academy and place of learning, but as a center for experimentation and innovation. This is also the primary birthplace of reanimates and the regional headquarters of the @UUID[.uPbpU972uzF4TxuE#the-order-of-the-staff]{The Order of the Staff}. Regardless of the vastness of the academy, enrollment is low, likely due to the restriction that only those who are approved by the Order of the Staff may attend.</p>\n<h3><span id=\"Old_Timeaus_Academy\">Old Timeaus Academy</span></h3>\n<p>Once a huge building sprawling over several acres of land, this ruin has been left untouched since the Campaign of Roses, save for the five-story tall obelisk standing in what was once the main courtyard, engraved with the names of all those lost. Aside from the general danger of being so near to @UUID[.OYj59KJky98HgcM7#the-pentagram]{The Pentagram} itself, ancient magical experiments left abandoned have a tendency to occasionally malfunction, releasing monsters into the streets or into the so-called Archive. The sprawling series of tunnels that once served as a vault and library for the academy now houses monsters, lost treasures, and more; many say the complex expands with each passing year, along with all the glory, riches, and power it offers..</p>\n<h3><span id=\"Cathedral_of_Shadow\">Cathedral of Shadow</span></h3>\n<img style=\"margin:0px 10px 10px 0px;border:0px;float:right\" src=\"modules/aaw-games-aventyr/Setting-images/Image_Portfolio_107_Fantasy-Jason-Walton-77-300x190.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"190\" />\n<p>Large, square, and utterly dark, no public entry is allowed into this imposing structure through the single door that faces out to the street.

Locals know that questioning the figures ends in bloodshed and not answers, and thus give them a wide berth.</p>\n<h3><span id=\"The_Pentagram-2\">The Pentagram</span></h3>\n<p>Several hundred feet across, the Pentagram is where the Obelisk Order continue their eternal ritual to keep the Shard of the Sun in orbit. The structure radiates heat and energy comparable to the sun itself, and standing too close leaves one’s skin dry and sore. The corners of the Pentagram are comprised of five huge pits, each of which normally holds numerous clear crystals charged with sun magic the ancient mages will use at the next Shedding.</p>\n<p> </p>\n</div>","markdown":""},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{"core":{"sheetClass":"core.JournalTextTinyMCESheet"}}},{"sort":1400000,"name":"Nyamo","type":"text","_id":"iUOrRhLyDdg71ghA","title":{"show":false,"level":1},"image":{},"text":{"format":1,"content":"<div class=\"aventyr\">\n<p class=\"s5\">Nyamo</p>\n<p>Nyamo is a walled city; aggressive outside threats necessitated the construction of a sturdy barrier hundreds of years ago.

While the goods and money were welcome, the ideas were not.</p>\n<img style=\"float:left;margin:0px 10px 10px 0px;border:0px\" src=\"modules/aaw-games-aventyr/Setting-images/Image_Portfolio_107_Fantasy-Jason-Walton-74-300x190.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"190\" />\n<p>The visiting merchants and migrants were mostly housed in the migrant district, which was composed of the majority of the northern half of the city. Construction began on a new section of the Nyamo Wall that effectively split the city in half, running down the middle and connecting each end to the original outer wall. Taller and thicker than the original wall, the huge gatehouse built into its center gave each side of the barrier its own portcullis.</p>\n<p>Traffic between the sections of the Nyamo Wall is strictly regulated—in order to pass, one must provide an acceptable reason, a gate tax must be paid, and a stamp issued. Those wishing to stay overnight must obtain permission and purchase a special permit to do so. Guards from the @UUID[.uPbpU972uzF4TxuE#the-order-of-the-staff]{The Order of the Staff} search each and every person that passes through the gate, ensuring that no contraband makes its way into Nyamo (normal magic items are not illegal, but may not pass through the gate; these must be surrendered or passage is also prohibited.) Usually travelers are given the option of simply turning around and not passing through the Nyamo Wall if they do not wish to surrender their items—in this city of Timaeus, this is just the cost of doing business. Those that pass through the gate are often followed by a member of the Order of the Staff, who make careful notes on interactions they make and often follow up questioning where searches occur (often using Nyamo scribe orbs).</p>\n<p>Those that wish to enter the city from outside must go to the Migrants’ Gate on the outer wall (unless they are a Timean citizen) where they are still subject to search and seizure, declaring all of their enchanted items; undeclared magic items are subject to confiscation. Those that wish to stay more than 24 hours must apply at the gate or at a Timean embassy for a permit, and anyone found entering the city under false pretenses are subject to expulsion or arrest. Only Timean citizens are allowed entry through the Timerian Gate. They must present the proper papers and declare any magic or valuable items obtained outside of Timaeus. Generally speaking, most citizens comply and seizures at this gate are rare.</p>\n<p>When the Nyamo Wall was constructed, the sewers under the city were modified, blocking passages with bars and grates, and in some cases blocking tunnels altogether. Over the years enterprising smugglers and other criminal elements have reopened some of these sealed passages to facilitate the burgeoning black market in Nyamo. While some goods are sold, it is most often news of the outside world that is traded, as well as books and other forms of publication. Several competing guilds operate underneath the Nyamo Wall, including those that support revolution; simple thievery and smuggling are often overlooked, with the occasional blatant offender caught and made an example of. However, the revolutionaries that deal in information and subterfuge are almost always put to death when caught.</p>\n<p>Entry into the tunnels that connect the two sides of the cities is a closely guarded secret. A select few safe houses on each side contain concealed entrances to the underground labyrinth—these are moved on a regular basis, the old entrances sealed up. Few people know of the existence of more than one way into the network under the Nyamo Wall, and even some of the guild masters do not know every entrance under their control.</p>\n<img style=\"display:block;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto\" src=\"modules/aaw-games-aventyr/Setting-images/warehouse-district-of-Nyamo.webp\" width=\"468\" height=\"737\" />\n<p> </p>\n</div>","markdown":""},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{"core":{"sheetClass":""}}},{"sort":1500000,"name":"Significant Characters","type":"text","_id":"UPVEdWjUv9JYfjX1","title":{"show":false,"level":1},"image":{},"text":{"format":1,"content":"<div class=\"aventyr\">\n<p class=\"s5\">Significant Characters</p>\n<h2>Nan’Min-Jun</h2>\n<p><strong>Nan’Min-Jun, Jang of the @UUID[.uPbpU972uzF4TxuE#the-order-of-the-rose]{Order of the Rose}</strong> (LE Male human aristocrat 8/wizard 8) Min-Jun makes himself to be an expert in everything, and very rarely is he proven wrong; he is excellent at foreseeing tiny details required to keep large plans on track.

In preparation for the arrival of the Shard of the Sun, he preached its benefits—the obtainment of unlimited energy, the power which would assist the high mages and all of Timaeus in dominating any foes that would dare to stand against them. The Obelisk Order vehemently opposed Mek’Madius’ stance and voted unanimously to revoke his place on the council; he was thrown out onto the street with the commoners, where he began to plot his revenge.</p>\n<p>As the Shard of the Sun grew closer to impacting the planet and Aventyr’s annihilation seemed imminent, the Obelisk Order marched north in a final attempt to intercept and destroy the incredibly powerful relic. Keeping to the shadows and using a potent artifact to remain undetected, Mek’Madius followed behind with nine of his former and most trusted apprentices, scheming to gain as much power as he could from the Shard of the Sun while stopping the Obelisk Order’s plans. The exiled mage was aware that his power alone would be insufficient to enact his revenge, but a mass sacrifice using souls to fuel his magic would give him a definite advantage over his former comrades.</p>\n<img style=\"float:left;margin:0px 10px 10px 0px;border:0px\" src=\"modules/aaw-games-aventyr/Setting-images/MekMadius-Hideout.webp\" width=\"342\" height=\"443\" />\n<p>The Obelisk Order arrived at the projected impact location of the Shard of the Sun, solemnly faced one another, and began the most powerful spell ever cast by mortals. Just as the rogue relic appeared overhead, Mek’Madius sacrificed his nine apprentices and began a powerful spell of his own. Utterly focused on their ritualistic arcane protections and the Shard of the Sun, the mages were unable to stop the exiled wizard as he channeled the soul energy into a powerful absorption spell, attempting to siphon off a portion of the magical and radiant energy from the Shard. But Mek’Madius’ evil and selfish acts came with a price—as a fragment of the powerful relic broke off and tumbled toward the earth, Mek’Madius’ very soul was drawn into the fragment. His selfishness and reckless abuse of power had transformed him into an undead creature, permanently bound to the fragment and destined to experience his unintended mortality in utter isolation.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>Fragment of the Sun Phylactery</h2>\n<p>Mek’Madius’ phylactery is not one he made by choice—his reckless use of souls to power the absorption spell failed to siphon all the power from the workings of the Obelisk Order, instead, channeling only some of the energy back through his own soul. At the same time as he completed his energy absorption, the mages repelled the Sun Shard from impacting the planet, causing fragments to break off.</p>\n<p>One of the largest fragments reflected the energy absorption back into Mek’Madius, pulling his soul out of his body and into the sky before slamming his essence into the sundered piece of the Shard of the Sun as it plummeted toward Aventyr. He had been transformed into a Lich, and the fragment of the Shard of the Sun his phylactery. The entire event was a complete mistake but he soon would come to see this curse as a blessing in disguise.</p>\n<p>The fragment stands at a height of seven feet and weighs 500 lbs.

For most of its past the region was home to no more than tribes of boggards and barbarians; their primitive lives changed some 900 years ago when Tranak Blackscale made the swamp his domain. A @UUID[.IdjkM3iKo5NPY1zu#black-dragons]{black dragon} with a passion for cruelty for its malicious sake, he enslaved creatures from the swamp to fulfill his wicked needs and amassed a veritable army of thralls. Over the centuries Tranak sired several children with different mates, all of whom met a grisly end when he decided they had outlived their usefulness (and more importantly, his interest). Eventually, the brood grew too large and Tranak’s children settled across the swamp in their own domains, quickly coming to blows with each other in skirmishes kept to a minimum by the overwhelming presence of their draconic father.</p>\n<p>So it was until the year 497 when Tranak’s slaves rebelled against his tyrannical rule, forming a loose rebellion of swamp creatures under the @UUID[.IdjkM3iKo5NPY1zu#bog-trolls]{bog troll} Theeble Dead-eye. The dragon and his children fought together in what they perceived as an easy battle, but when Tranak and his two eldest were brought low by what the legends describe as a powerful secret weapon wielded by an unknown barbarian chieftain from an unnamed tribe, the six remaining children took flight and hid deep in the swamplands. Soon the alliance crumbled and boggards, trolls, and humans took up the roles they had before the arrival of Blackscale, fighting over small stretches of dry land in the otherwise inhospitable swamp.</p>\n<p>101 years after his death Tranak’s children revealed their presence to the tribes of the swamp—all six dragons swept through it sowing death and destruction everywhere they went. In the following years, the dragons started to fight amongst themselves over territory and slaves, their conflicts occasionally shaking the swamp as two or sometimes more knocked each other’s massive bodies across the landscape. In 665 Satthruphar was killed in one such battle with @UUID[.JuqcYkrHQOMobwTy#hatrumak]{Hatrumak}, Tranak’s eldest remaining son. Upon realizing that they themselves were the biggest threat to their dominion, the dragons signed a magical treaty drawn by Hatrumak, dividing the swamp into five regions with a small area deemed neutral to all. Each laired in one of the different regions with the resources in each territory belonging to the dragon within though today the swamp still sees battles between the children of Blackscale (rare as these occurrences may be).</p>\n<p><br />Not a hundred years after the Treaty Draconis, an innkeeper named Teth Aslody found a dry area east of the swamp near the Yerek Steppes; here he founded an inn named @UUID[.Tdkqx23iD22AVlLv]{Cherrian’s Rest}. It quickly became popular amongst the people traveling around the swamp until one day a small fire resulted in a massive explosion and the establishment burned down. That conflagration resulted in the discovery of black gold, an ebony sludge found naturally in the swamp that seems to feed flames—soon an export business was organized. The inn was rebuilt and a small community grew up around it; Teth died five years later and his nephew, Iramar, inherited Cherrian’s Rest along with his father’s share of the black gold operation. He set about making the enterprise much more effective and therefore profitable, and after a few years Iramar and the merchant families—which have shares in the operation—founded the Black Gold Consortium. These traders pretty much run the town of Cherrian’s Rest today, despite the mayor and council’s faulty belief of authority.</p>\n<h1><span id=\"History\">History</span></h1>\n<p><strong>Year –1200</strong><br />The mysterious ruins in the north of the Vast Swamp are abandoned by their equally mysterious builders.<br /><strong>Year –1100<br /></strong>The first human tribes settle in the Vast Swamp; they are quickly drawn into conflict with the boggards and trolls of the area.

This ritual of subjugation does not take place all over the swamp, but tribes within [[/roll 1d4x10]] miles of a dragon are all forced to participate.<br />This practice of flattery is unknown in the @UUID[.oIbJsrbNZu7GVWp9#the-muddy-mangroves]{Muddy Mangroves}; the King of Mud does not need the swamp to know of his existence just yet. While the dragons are considered the government in their respective regions, in Cherrian’s Rest a mayor and a council run the town—though the Black Gold Consortium is never left out of the loop and nothing happens unless they have been asked for their opinion, a thing Magistrate Alexander Gelmar is only too happy to give.</p>\n</div>","markdown":""},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{"core":{"sheetClass":"core.JournalTextTinyMCESheet"}}},{"sort":400000,"name":"Geography","type":"text","_id":"oIbJsrbNZu7GVWp9","title":{"show":false,"level":1},"image":{},"text":{"format":1,"content":"<div class=\"aventyr\"><p class=\"s5\">Geography</p><p>The Vast Swamp is in many ways unremarkable from other regions like it, filled with bogs and mangrove trees. Along the torn coast the water slowly progresses from salty to brackish, eventual filtering into freshwater that pervades the six distinctive regions of the swamp. While the dragons that live in five of the regions are of the same type, their individual desires and interests have shaped their abodes into vastly different landscapes over the course of a few centuries. Below are short introductions to each region, each bearing the names given in the Treaty Draconis.</p><h2><span id=\"The_Tangled_Forest\">The Tangled Forest</span></h2><p>The domain of @UUID[.JuqcYkrHQOMobwTy#hatrumak]{Hatrumak }(the eldest of Tranak Blackscale’s surviving children, and an accomplished necromancer in his own right) is by far the darkest and most twisted of the draconic realms in the Vast Swamp. Once home to beautiful, serene scenes with mangrove trees and colorful birds, today plants stand in stale pools of poisonous swamp water, the vivid avians long gone. The closer to Hatrumak’s lair one journeys the more poisonous the landscape gets but before any travelers can get too close, they have to deal with the tribes of ghouls that prowl through the landscape. When Hatrumak drafted the Treaty Draconis he gave himself the northern part of the Vast Swamp: serene, vibrant bogs where Satthruphar was said to have her lair.<br />None of Blackscale’s offspring wanted the northern reaches, an area deemed worthless by Hatrumak’s siblings, but the dragon discovered ancient, mysterious ruins close to the border with @UUID[JournalEntry.RMK7HBFDlPXDiURg]{Naera Cull}. Hatrumak believes that the legendary secret weapon that killed his father is somehow connected to those ruins, and he deliberately killed Satthruphar to take over her domain before drafting the Treaty Draconis to ensure he could study his findings without interference from his siblings. If his brothers and sisters were to find out that he engineered the whole incident leading to the Treaty Draconis to further his own agenda, they would immediately move against him. However, should Hatrumak’s theories on the ancient ruins prove to be correct and should he discover the mysterious weapon, his siblings will be in for a surprise indeed.</p><h3>Ancient Ruins</h3><p>In the north of the @UUID[.oIbJsrbNZu7GVWp9#the-tangled-forest]{Tangled Forest} are the mysterious remnants of an ancient city; none know who built it, or even how or why they did so. The half-submerged grey stone buildings lead to stone corridors that pierce deep into the swamp (some still dry, whereas others have been flooded for centuries). Most of the markings on the ruins have eroded into unrecognizable shapes, although the word Frothor is clearly visible on several buildings and its meaning continues to elude @UUID[.JuqcYkrHQOMobwTy#hatrumak]{Hatrumak}. The dragon has been actively trying to capture adventuring bands to force them to explore the area for him in exchange for their freedom (an offer he has yet to keep his word on) and a few months ago one such band brought back a stone depicting a battle between dragons and several different humanoid shapes. In his excitement Hatrumak almost forgot to eat the adventures, though his vile servants quickly remedied that mistake.</p><h2>Mire of Poison</h2><p>Nestled in between the Tangled Forest and the Torn Coast lay a region home to the highest concentration of rare and poisonous plants—the ad-hoc realm of the self-appointed Queen of Poison, @UUID[.JuqcYkrHQOMobwTy#allunhandra]{Allunhandra}. Far and away the most elusive of the brethren of Tranak Blackscale, she is rarely seen; when she is observed, it is mostly by ships as she flies out over the coast and turns north. No one knows where she goes after that, most believing that she merely patrols her domain. The truth is far darker than mere roaming, however, as Allunhandra is, in fact, the notorious procurer of poisons for several cults all over Aventyr (where she goes by the name Granny Death, after her guise of a mild-looking elderly woman).</p><p>Allunhandra always travels under invisibility when flying over the Aventyr mainland but sometimes she does not cast the spell until well out over the Bay of Genthor. She does not care much for what her siblings are up to so long as they do not meddle in her affairs. Tranak always saw something special in his youngest daughter—it was she who traveled in human guise across the Vast Swamp to poison the barbarian chieftain who killed her beloved father while the rest of his children hid and cowered in fear. The dragon slayer’s death was not enough, however, and she watched with glee as the entire tribe succumbed to the poisoned drinking water. Allunhandra prefers humans as servants but even her most trusted minions do not know that she is, in fact, Granny Death. The dragon’s pride and joy is a small laboratory in which several captured alchemists slave away to produce new and potent toxins for their mistress.</p><h3>Queen’s Garden</h3><p>Amid the mangroves stand several patches of brightly colored flowers—for a few minutes they seem a natural occurrence, but with a cursory investigation it becomes clear that they’ve been cultivated as there are distinct borders between the patches, and even small pathways to get through the garden without ruining the flowers. Here in the @UUID[.oIbJsrbNZu7GVWp9#mire-of-poison]{Mire of Poison} is where @UUID[.JuqcYkrHQOMobwTy#allunhandra]{Allunhandra’s }alchemists experiment with different plants to perfect the poisons for their mistress in a small hidden laboratory somewhere nearby. These patches of cultivation are relatively new; the old garden had to be abandoned a decade ago when one of the flowers became so poisonous that in bloom it killed any creature that wandered too near. The old garden is located 5 miles to the east of the new garden, shunned by both the wildlife in the area as well as Allunhandra’s servants.</p><h2>The Muddy Mangroves</h2><p><br />The youngest of Tranak’s children, @UUID[.JuqcYkrHQOMobwTy#trymgarx]{Trymgarx} dwells in a muddy swampland so inhospitable that only boggards and other amphibians can eke out an existence. The water is always murky and dirty, the trees are dark and have patches of mud on their trunks that seems to grow bigger ever so slowly, and it is as if the land suffers from a presence vile beyond comprehension. In the aftermath of the Treaty Draconis, Trymgarx feared for his life after the death of his beloved sister Satthruphar—as the youngest he could not protect himself against @UUID[.JuqcYkrHQOMobwTy#hatrumak]{Hatrumak}, let alone avenge his sister. The dragonling sought the attention of beings powerful enough to protect him, bartering with demons he intended to be his bodyguards. It was only when the King of Mud set foot in the swamp that Trymgarx realized his mistake; the powerful hezrou had no intention of serving a dragon, instead taking Blackscale’s child as yet another trophy. Today Trymgarx the black dragon lies at the base of the King of Mud’s throne in the @UUID[.oIbJsrbNZu7GVWp9#bastion-of-filth]{Bastion of Filth} in the muddy swamp land.<br />The King of Mud sends his minions across the Vast Swamp and beyond to determine the best time for expanding his territory. The northern border of the Muddy Mangroves consists of hardened mud where the searing conditions of the Scorched Lands make the expansion impossible, prompting the King of Mud to turn his gaze south. Presently he considers the @UUID[.oIbJsrbNZu7GVWp9#the-mangrove-maze]{Mangrove Maze} a thorn in his eye, the serene beauty of the place anathema to his own domain (seeded as it is with his dangerous servants), but @UUID[.Tdkqx23iD22AVlLv]{Cherrian’s Rest} stands between the two areas and invading the neutral territory would definitely attract unwanted attention from the dragons of the Vast Swamp. These considerations leave the King of Mud with only one other route of expansion: the @UUID[.oIbJsrbNZu7GVWp9#the-tangled-forest]{Tangled Forest}. He has increased the number of scouts sent into Hatrumak’s domain, causing more and more skirmishes between the two as a predictable result. So far his the dragon has deemed the losses to his undead servants beneath his notice, and has not moved against what he perceives as the unintelligent designs of an adolescent whelp.</p><h3>Bastion of Filth</h3><p>Standing amongst the tallest specimens of the @UUID[.oIbJsrbNZu7GVWp9#the-muddy-mangroves]{Muddy Mangroves}, the Bastion of Filth pierces the green canopy with its swirling spires. The structure itself is made of wet mud that somehow still retains enough solidity to form floors and walls—it is shaped into exquisite crenellations and spires that mimic the architectural style of the grandest castles of the @UUID[JournalEntry.QVrlu0lTv2vFtT5P]{Klavek Kingdom}. Within the Bastion of Filth demons and mud elementals serve the King of Mud’s every desire, and those that displease him are dealt with by @UUID[.JuqcYkrHQOMobwTy#trymgarx]{Trymgarx} in a suitably spectacular fashion. South of the Bastion of Filth is an area covered in a pall of dragonsbreath mist; within this madness-inducing haze there is an entrance to the feared Underworld swamp, the Dar’Spelun Slugmarsh.</p><p> </p><h2>The Mangrove Maze</h2><p><br />Southeast of @UUID[.Tdkqx23iD22AVlLv]{Cherrian’s Rest} stand majestic groves of mangrove trees, an area that seems untouched by the dragon lairing within. While it is indeed inviting and bountiful in hunting, this is all a ruse to lure in unsuspecting travelers. @UUID[.JuqcYkrHQOMobwTy#kallothrax]{Kallothrax} is a devious, evil, and somewhat lazy dragon—why hunt when the prey can be led straight to him? His lair is submerged within a veritable maze of mangroves, creating a labyrinth filled by his servants; several tribes of @UUID[.IdjkM3iKo5NPY1zu#boggards]{boggards} drive unfortunate victims deeper into the maze towards the waiting dragon, where he decides if they are to be prisoners to be toyed with or food.<br />While Kallothrax tries to keep the area looking inviting to lure in prey, there are signs of draconic infestation throughout it: slightly acidic water, twisted trees, and animal carcasses half-dissolved by acid. When the dragon is not brutalizing or torturing prisoners he has been known to attack some of the boats braving his domain to get to Cherrian’s Rest. These rare raids garner him slaves, prisoners, and food, but more importantly it sates a primal need to take flight and reign destruction; after sowing chaos to his satisfaction he can turn his attention back to his cruel games, much to the despair of his unfortunate prisoners. Recently Kallothrax discovered that the lightly guarded caravans of the Yerek Steppes to be easy pickings and in the southern steppes he is spoken of in hushed whispers, “lest you speak the Black Scourge’s name and he comes for you at dusk.”</p><h3>The Dreaming Fields</h3><p>This dry area in the @UUID[.oIbJsrbNZu7GVWp9#the-mangrove-maze]{Mangrove Maze} (near the Yerek Steppes) has various flowers that give off a mild narcotic as they bloom, causing humanoids and animals to drift off into sleep. There have been a few attempts to harvest the flowers to distill them into a recreational drug, but so far nearly all of these experiments have met with failure. Hathro Dunelle was behind the latest major attempt but has instead turned his attention to the unfortunate travelers that enter the fields. His men are using magical breathing covers to protect themselves and collect the sleeping unfortunates, which then awaken in chains bound for slavery somewhere on Aventyr.</p><h2><span id=\"The_Jagged_Coast\">The Jagged Coast</span></h2><p>The southwestern coastline of the Vast Swamp consists of black rocks, a testament to prehistoric volcanic activity in the region. @UUID[.JuqcYkrHQOMobwTy#dreivantix]{Dreivantix} lairs deep within, so vile that his scales secrete a potent acid that leaks into the swamp waters, giving the bogs and marshes here slightly acidic properties (which increase in potency closer to his lair). The dragon formed the black coastal rocks himself, using his breath to make what looks like unnatural tears in the stones, as though some gigantic beast tried to claw its way into the swamp. He did so as a show of his power, terraforming the entire coastline into a testament to his strength. All of Dreivantix’s slaves display his draconic rune somewhere on their bodies, burned into their skin with claw and acid. He has no preference for a particular race of slaves—as long as they have a patch of skin to display his rune on their bodies.</p><h3>Blackstone Fortress</h3><p>This half overgrown fortress on the @UUID[.oIbJsrbNZu7GVWp9#the-jagged-coast]{Jagged Coast} is the lair of a tribe of green-scaled @UUID[.IdjkM3iKo5NPY1zu#blackstone-kobolds]{kobolds} as well as several odd assassin vines that curiously do not attack the little reptilians. Located close to the region which contains Cherrian’s Rest the fortification offers the kobolds some measure of protection from Dreivantix (who lairs closer to the coast). Blackstone fortress was originally built by a forgotten warlord as an attempt to control the area but as so many other attempts to do so, only the ruins remain today as a reminder of the folly it is to try and tame the Vast Swamp.</p><h2><span id=\"Tomb_of_Satthruphar\">Tomb of Satthruphar</span></h2><p>This stretch of swampland is named after the dragon Satthruphar. @UUID[.JuqcYkrHQOMobwTy#hatrumak]{Hatrumak} lured her into the area and over the fields of fire, then used his claws, teeth, and spells to tire her before she fell into the fields, dying in the flaming inferno as her murderous brother circled above. By chance (or misfortune) this area was also where the @UUID[.Tdkqx23iD22AVlLv]{Cherrian’s Rest }inn was founded.</p><h2>Black Gold Island</h2><p>This dry area west of Cherrian’s Rest is the premier extraction facility for the Black Gold Consortium’s operations in the Vast Swamp.</p><h2>Fields of Fire</h2><p>South of Cherrian’s Rest are massive areas of swamp so saturated with black gold that even the smallest spark can ignite them. They occasionally catch fire on their own but sometimes they get ignited by outside forces (such as in 665 when Hatrumak used them to kill Satthruphar). Unsubstantiated local legends claim the fields have been burning since before Tranak Blackscale’s arrival.</p><p> </p><p> </p></div>","markdown":""},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{"core":{"sheetClass":"core.JournalTextPageSheet"}}},{"sort":500000,"name":"Cultural groups","type":"text","_id":"IdjkM3iKo5NPY1zu","title":{"show":false,"level":1},"image":{},"text":{"format":1,"content":"<div class=\"aventyr\">\n<p class=\"s5\">Cultural groups</p>\n<h2>Blackstone Kobolds</h2>\n<p>Kobolds are quite rare in the swamp proper but where the land is dry and the conditions ripe for plunder, the kobold tricksters of Traskoria can be found. These miscreants are all originally spawned from a place dubbed “Blackstone” by the little beasties, @UUID[.oIbJsrbNZu7GVWp9#blackstone-fortress]{a large fortress} overgrown with dangerous plants such as assassin vines (though the malicious plants mysteriously do not attack the ample population of kobolds around them), in the Torn Coast region near the the border with Satthruphar.</p>\n<h2>Bog Trolls</h2>\n<p>One species of troll dominates nearly all of the vast swamp—the bog troll raider. With a range of 40 miles these nasty creatures make life miserable for every humanoid attempting to eke out an existence here. There are two types of bog trolls: hunters which live in the wild, subsisting on a diet of bog toads and giant salamanders, and raiders which are much more dangerous to travelers and band together in groups of 4 or more to attack human ships moving through the Vast Swamp. The raiders consistently find their bellies full and their hidden treasure hordes well stocked, killing, cooking, and eating humanoids only after stripping them of all valuables. Then they hide their treasure somewhere deep in the swamp, sometimes forgetting where their spoils have been concealed.</p>\n<h2>Boggards</h2>\n<p>Little is known of the boggard tribes of the Vast Swamp. Rumors persist of individuals lost in the bogs being kidnapped and sacrificed by the frog creatures to some ancient deity which has not been seen in the world for many centuries.</p>\n<h2>Ghouls</h2>\n<p>Several tribes of ghouls live in the north of the Vast Swamp, all of them under the thrall of @UUID[.JuqcYkrHQOMobwTy#hatrumak]{Hatrumak}. Ghouls can be found in all the regions but not in the same dense concentration as in the Tangled Forest.</p>\n<h2>Humans</h2>\n<p>Humans are the most predominant race of the Vast Swamp and the most unpredictable. They can fill any role in the consortium, often taking on multiple tasks in the community as well; almost every human in the swamp has worked for the Black Gold Consortium at one time or another.</p>\n<p>The human barbarian tribes who call the Vast Swamp home are as varied and diverse as humans elsewhere in Aventyr. In the @UUID[.oIbJsrbNZu7GVWp9#the-mangrove-maze]{Mangrove Maze} the Moonhowlers practice their vile hedonistic rituals, boasting a formidable proportion of lycanthropes among their number, while the Torn Coast’s Tribe of the Crocodile worships a large fiendish reptilian, and the demon-hunting Bloodclaw tribe in the @UUID[.oIbJsrbNZu7GVWp9#the-muddy-mangroves]{Muddy Mangroves} proves to be a constant nuisance to the @UUID[.JuqcYkrHQOMobwTy#the-king-of-mud]{King of Mud}.</p>\n<h2>Ratfolk</h2>\n<p>In its early years small skirmishes broke out between factions of the Black Gold Consortium—small scale warfare left the Gelmar, Asoldy, and Celfal families scrambling for soldiers. Seeing the opening niche in the swamp, a regiment of hardened ratfolk crossbow troops were employed to bolster the might of these families. The kin of the marksmen came into the swamp after their relatives decided to settle and there is now a saying: on every corner of the market in @UUID[.Tdkqx23iD22AVlLv]{Cherrian’s Rest} there’s a ratfolk peddler selling his wares (even when the gold dries up).</p>\n<h2>Halflings</h2>\n<p>Halflings are often called upon when the Black Gold Consortium needs something done in a tight spot. Small folk can often find employment cleaning or fixing in-between the cogs of extraction centers, or removing blockages in tall chimneys or long pipes; the work is always dangerous, so they expect to be paid well. The Neliton family is one of the core families in the consortium and in charge of halfling relations in @UUID[.Tdkqx23iD22AVlLv]{Cherrian’s Res}t. The family’s easy going nature has protected them from the internal conflicts of the consortium—they love to show off their strong sense of fashion. The Nelitons are the trendsetting family of the Consortium, often wearing the finest garments and jewels just to show off their lavishness and to invoke the jealousy of the other families.</p>\n<h2>Elves</h2>\n<p>Magic is used by the Black Gold Consortium to speed up extraction and enhance the efficiency of its workers, tasks excelled at by elven mages and alchemists—it spends a hefty sum to these scholars if they can provide results. @UUID[JournalEntry.QlctNkzE9injOde9.JournalEntryPage.ei36LjIhEoh87vgE]{Elves}  reluctantly take the money for their services but their true reasons for inhabiting the area remain hidden from the Black Gold Consortium. The elves’ love of nature is always paramount and the reason why they are truly working with them is to see that the business does not damage the ecosystem of the swamp. Magic means of extraction are cleaner and less damaging to the area, and there are whispers of a secret order of elven saboteurs who work towards stopping any forms of extraction that the elves do not approve of.</p>\n<h2>Half-Orcs</h2>\n<p>Usually @UUID[JournalEntry.QlctNkzE9injOde9.JournalEntryPage.7AP9WRRk8pR9xpgU]{Half-Orc} are viewed with distrust and fear, but unlike the rest of the world, in the Vast Swamp a they are regarded as a valuable asset to the Black Gold Consortium. Due to their strength, half-orcs often find work on the loading docks of the extraction facilities. Hailing from lands far away and arriving in seemingly ceaseless caravans called “Olive Wagons”, escaped half-orc slaves and half-orc wanderers alike often find new homes in the bogs and marshes of the Vast Swamp.</p>\n<h2>Tieflings</h2>\n<p>The infamous background of tieflings leaves many on the fringes of normal society but in the Vast Swamp any race is welcome so long as they have gold. Demon-touched find the swamp to be an oasis amongst a hostile world and to some the bogs even have a smell that appeals to their brimstone-tinged nostrils. Hellspawn in particular are called upon to manage many of the facilities of the Black Gold Consortium, their knack of keeping to rigid timelines and organizing even the most hectic of extraction facilities leaving them well-suited as supervisors.</p>\n<h2>Dwarves</h2>\n<p>The only @UUID[JournalEntry.QlctNkzE9injOde9.JournalEntryPage.t4LZuyNruvzneOHD]{Dwarf} living in the Vast Swamp tend to have migrated from human lands or live below ground in the Underswamp, a foul smelling place filled with the muck which drips from above and the noxious gases that fuel the flames of the Fire Fields. There are even rumors of the Black Sea, an Underworld sea made from pure oil upon which stout folk ships sail. Thus far these have proven to be rumors and exaggeration of adventurers, as the only true source of oil to date has been found by drilling in Vast Swamp itself.</p>\n<h2>Black Dragons</h2>\n<p>Five black dragons live within Traskoria (the Vast Swamp) and have done so for hundreds of years. They once warred with one another over territory and spoils but signed a magical pact two hundred years ago to divide up the region and stop the fighting. Ever since then the bogs and marshes have become much quieter, but every once in awhile one of the dragons goes on a rampage, destroying any humanoid settlements within his or her section of the realm then claiming all the riches and slaves as their own.</p>\n<p> </p>\n</div>","markdown":""},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}},{"sort":600000,"name":"Significant Characters","type":"text","_id":"JuqcYkrHQOMobwTy","title":{"show":false,"level":1},"image":{},"text":{"format":1,"content":"<div class=\"aventyr\"><p class=\"s5\">Significant Characters</p><h2>Hatrumak</h2><p><strong> (CE Male very old black dragon wizard 9) </strong>Hatrumak is fond of manipulating his servants and enjoys making adventurers do his bidding (whether through intimidation or sweet lies).</p><h2>Allunhandra</h2><p><strong>(NE Female old black dragon alchemist 7)</strong> Allunhandra is a dragon with a strength of mind that is impressive even for one of her kind.

It must be added that the tales of the rogues have become known but so far none have surfaced to verify these claims.

The Great Wyrm Tranak Blackscale reigned over all the creatures in the bogs, good and wicked, his brood growing so large that they were left with no choice but to seek out territory to the west and east. Ultimately he was defeated by a loose alliance of enslaved swamp creatures led by a courageous barbarian chieftain. After the climactic end the newly freed slaves tried to return to the ways of life they held before Tranak had claimed the area as his own. Trolls began pillaging, @UUID[.IdjkM3iKo5NPY1zu#boggards]{boggards} hid in their small mud houses as goblin tribes warred with each other, and lizardfolk clans etched out a meager existence as small bands of human merchants tried to pass around the swamp on their way to more prosperous lands in the east. Other than the building of small camps in the bogs, it was scantly touched by humans for 300 years.</p><p>The founding of a seemingly insignificant inn called Cherrian’s Rest transformed everything in the Vast Swamp. Seeing the dry portion of land in the north and noting the need for a stop along the long road taken by merchants on their trek around the bogs, a brave innkeeper named Teth Aslody built the establishment and named it after his deceased wife. Under no circumstances did he know it was sitting on one of the most lucrative and rare resources the world has ever seen—until Teth lost everything.</p><p>One day while cooking a meal for some adventures his kitchen caught on fire. In a fright the old innkeeper and his guests collected water from the swamp in an effort to put out the blaze, but in their haste they had inadvertently scooped up what was to be called “black gold” instead. When Teth tried to put out the flames with the contents of the bucket he was thrown clear into the muck from the resulting explosion. Horrified, the adventures tried frantically to quell the flames but Teth`s beloved inn was too far gone.</p><p>The wizard of the group had a very keen eye and noted that when anyone emptied the blackened sludge water over the flames, the fire grew larger rather than diminish. When the mage told the party his observations they were able to control the flames before they extended into the whole swamp, but the tavern was devastated and the old man forced to rebuild it. Feeling somewhat guilt-ridden that it was their meal that caused the inferno, the group offered to escort the innkeeper to the nearest city. They all became fast friends and after a night at a campfire discussion, the adventurers found out that the old man was once a rich merchant and this was the second time he had lost almost everything and needed to rebuild. Teth kept some amount of his fortune hidden away for a time of need, however, and the money would be more than enough to rebuild his life once again.</p><p>This time the innkeeper had devised a plan after reading the wizard’s account of the explosion—the savvy old man knew that this black sludge would one day make him rich. Indebted of his new companions’ actions at trying to save his inn (and succeeding at saving his life), he offered to go into business with the adventurs. Old man Asoldy made the party promise that everything would be shared amongst them all equally, and together, they founded a small merchant consortium and extracted a modest amount of the sludgy black substance which he named “black gold.” Teth Asoldy passed away 5 years later and the business was tossed into anarchy as the adventures jockeyed for a bigger share of the profitable resource. Suffering from the brutal infighting and left severely weakened, when young Iramar Asold arrived to take over his uncle’s estate, Teth’s nephew saw that the groups was severely hampering the progress of the Black Gold Consortium, so he invited foreign merchant families to invest in it. Soon there were numerous elite traders flocking to become part of the venture and the other owners began to sell their shares. After they sold all their shares Iramar decided to call the new group of merchant families the Black Gold Consortium.</p><p>The founding of the Black Gold Consortium led to many changes to the area around the former inn; people flocked when offers to work for the Consortium spread and the settlement blossomed into a town, then a city as more and more settlers from different lands came to the area. New technologies based around the black sludge were invented, such as the gas lamps that light the city at night. Specially designed swamp boats with large rotating paddles and a shallow draft were developed to aid in the logistics required to transport more and more black gold. Ultimately over the course of 150 years, the cultures of the original colonizers have become distinct and unique, leaving behind archaic and useless traditions in favor of a way of life better suited to the Vast Swamp.</p><h2>Cherrian’s Rest (settlement statblock)</h2><p>Neutral small city</p><p><strong>Modifiers Crime</strong> +0, <strong>Economy</strong> +2, <strong>Law</strong> -2, <strong>Lore</strong> +0, <strong>Society</strong> +4</p><p><strong>Qualities:</strong> Insular, Notorious, Prosperous, Strategic Location</p><p><strong>Danger:</strong> 15</p><p><strong>Government:</strong> Council</p><p><strong>Population:</strong> 5,700</p><p><strong>Notable NPCs: </strong>Iramar Aslody, Head of the Black Gold Consortium (LN Male human [Klavek] expert 5)</p><p><strong>Base Value</strong> 6,827 gp; <strong>Purchase Limit</strong> 56,250 gp; <strong>Spellcasting</strong> 6th</p><p><strong>Minor Items</strong> 4d4; <strong>Medium Items</strong> 3d4; <strong>Major Items</strong> 1d6</p></div>","markdown":""},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}}],"flags":{"cf":{"id":null},"core":{"sourceId":"Compendium.Aventyr-Campaign-Setting.aventyr-campaign.g4odaMsHbRkeNFhn"},"scene-packer":{"hash":"ccb29663a8b0242b7eccd7154fdd1a2f61234e86"}},"_stats":{"systemId":"dnd5e","systemVersion":"2.1.4","coreVersion":"10.291","createdTime":1664097018913,"modifiedTime":1675795621820,"lastModifiedBy":"EsIYTtNnjwxUbKOG"},"_id":"g4odaMsHbRkeNFhn","ownership":{"default":0,"R5IsvMTH5P79pBoG":3},"folder":"j9cXBagzZ1ARsO2I","sort":1100000},{"name":"Vikmordere","pages":[{"name":"Vikmordere","type":"text","_id":"U0BsD4hsNZmyzTxq","title":{"show":false,"level":1},"image":{},"text":{"format":1,"content":"<div class=\"aventyr\">\n<p class=\"s5\">Vikmordere</p>\n<img style=\"display:block;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto\" src=\"modules/aaw-games-aventyr/Setting-images/Vikmordere-map.webp\" width=\"443\" height=\"470\" />\n<p> </p>\n<img style=\"float:right;margin:0px 10px 10px 0px;border:0px\" src=\"modules/aaw-games-aventyr/Setting-images/Vikmordere-Resounding-Bodhran.png\" width=\"198\" height=\"400\" />\n<p>The word Vikmordere can be used either to describe the region in which the barbarian people live or the people themselves.

The oldest texts of the Klavek Kingdom recall a massive settlement of Vikmordere that encompassed not only the Eastern Mountain region, but the plains beyond into what is now the Klavek Kingdom. It is unknown how the Vikmordere were reduced in number, but their populace was diminished and they withdrew to higher elevations. They sought refuge in the frigid snow covered eastern mountains. This is the only region in the world where the Vikmordere still survive (and thrive).</p>\n<img style=\"display:block;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto\" src=\"modules/aaw-games-aventyr/Setting-images/sm-Raiding-Clan-Jarls.webp\" width=\"404\" height=\"525\" />\n<h2>Geography</h2>\n<p> </p>\n<img style=\"float:right;margin:0px 10px 10px 0px;border:0px\" src=\"modules/aaw-games-aventyr/Setting-images/Vikmordere-Snekkja-of-Rowing-1-480x579.png\" width=\"284\" height=\"343\" />\n<p>Vikmordere territory encompasses the entire Vikmordere Valley save the Rybalkan Peninsula.</p>\n<p>The mountains which protect the valley are a rugged and dangerous environment with few routes or trails which connect. The summit of most peaks is packed with snow and ancient glaciers, a cold unforgiving wilderness where few creatures can survive. The lower peaks are covered in pine trees which dot their way down sharp slopes and over rugged hills up to the edge of the @UUID[JournalEntry.ismpCNWpGHvB1iPw.JournalEntryPage.Erya8w29cRTTJELu]{Serpent Lake}.</p>\n<p>Serpent Lake and the Vikmordere Valley contain most of the flora and fauna of the region. The lake’s edge makes for the perfect Vikmordere gathering place for camping and telling stories while feasting. When in danger, the Vikmordere take to the mountains and disappear into inhospitable lands where few can follow, let alone survive.</p>\n<p>The @UUID[.U0BsD4hsNZmyzTxq#boreal-forest]{Boreal Forest} stretches along the southernmost parts of the Serpent Lake and consists of a mix of spruce, pines, birch, larches and tranteum trees.</p>\n<h1>Boreal Forest</h1>\n<h2>Weather</h2>\n<p>The winters in this part of the world, with average temperatures below freezing, last six to eight months. Temperatures vary from −54 °C to 30 °C (-65 °F to 86 °F) throughout the whole year. The summers, while short, are generally warm. In large parts of this region, -20 °C would be a typical winter day temperature and 18 °C an average summer day. Snow may remain on the ground for as long as nine months.</p>\n<p>Precipitation is low; rain does fall during the short summer, but mostly it’s snow and fog, the latter coming from the thawing of the frozen Serpent Lake starting in late spring. Due to the fog, sunshine is not abundant in the boreal forest of the region, even during the long summer days, but there is enough moisture to sustain a dense forest growth.</p>\n<h2>Flora</h2>\n<p>The forest along the southern parts of the @UUID[JournalEntry.ismpCNWpGHvB1iPw.JournalEntryPage.Erya8w29cRTTJELu]{Serpent Lake} consists of a mix of spruce, pines, birch, larches and @UUID[.U0BsD4hsNZmyzTxq#tranteum-tree]{tranteum trees}.</p>\n<p>Due to the cold, the soil is thin and poor in nutrients. Fallen leaves and moss can remain on the forest floor for a long time in the cool, moist climate, which limits their organic contribution to the soil. Acids from evergreen needles further leach the soil, sometimes creating areas that are almost sandy and excessively drained. In other parts of the region, only lichens join the moss. In forest clearings, herbs, berries, shrubs and wildflowers can be found, among them the infamous @UUID[.U0BsD4hsNZmyzTxq#stinkberries]{Stinkberry bushes} and the dangerous Calathgar. Twisted Treants are known to have clearings as their favorite spots in this area, and act as gardening guardians, occasionally gaining the powers of a druid to complement their natural abilities.</p>\n<p>In the northern parts of the region, the closed canopied forest gives way to a more widely spaced lichen woodland, with diminished foliage on the windward side.</p>\n<p>Periodic wildfires with return times of about 50 years clear out the tree canopies, allowing sunlight to invigorate new growth on the forest floor. For some species, wildfires are a necessary part of the life cycle in the taiga; some have cones which only open to release their seed after a fire, dispersing their seeds onto the newly cleared ground.</p>\n<h3>Tranteum Tree</h3>\n<p>The tranteum tree, an evergreen, is endemic in this part of the world, its wood much sought of by elves who like to use it for bows with an especially long range. A masterwork bow out of its wood and built by an elven master has its range increment heightened by 10′. Because the sun is low in the horizon for most of the year, it is difficult for plants to generate energy from photosynthesis. Tantreum trees do not lose their leaves seasonally and are able to photosynthesize with their older leaves in late winter and spring when light is good but temperatures are still too low for new growth to commence. The ground freezes during the winter months and plant roots are unable to absorb water, so the Tantreum tree has found a unique way to store warm water beneath its bark. If released by needy creatures, the warm water is enough for one medium humanoid for a day and also heals two points of nonlethal damage from cold, but the Tantreum tree will wither and die as a result. Elven druids of the Northlands are known to get very angry should this happen.</p>\n<h3>Stinkberries</h3>\n<p>Stinkberries, which can be found in forest clearings, emit an acidic smell even before plucked, but more so once removed from the thorny twigs of the infamous Stinkberry bushes. They can be crushed easily and the resulting tar-like substance pasted on the skin, which lowers Charisma-based skill checks by 2 versus creatures with a sense of smell. They also turn the skin slightly paler. The first two days of wearing Stinkberry paste the wearer is nauseated also, then she gets used to the smell. Orcs and @UUID[JournalEntry.QlctNkzE9injOde9.JournalEntryPage.7AP9WRRk8pR9xpgU]{Half-Orc} are immune against this nauseating side effect for unknown reasons. The upside of the Stinkberries is that they drive away insects of all kinds, which is a blessing in the summer months, and also drives away dweomercats and ahlinni. Nonetheless, the usage of stinkberry paste is forbidden in the villages @UUID[JournalEntry.QVrlu0lTv2vFtT5P.JournalEntryPage.EMzVKZQWrG8a60Xj#drakkal]{Drak’kal} and @UUID[JournalEntry.QVrlu0lTv2vFtT5P.JournalEntryPage.EMzVKZQWrG8a60Xj#sunglor]{Sunglor}, but not in @UUID[JournalEntry.QVrlu0lTv2vFtT5P.JournalEntryPage.EMzVKZQWrG8a60Xj#torrent]{Torrent}, which regularly leads to lots of comments among the @UUID[JournalEntry.QlctNkzE9injOde9.JournalEntryPage.DXD1ygEckY0JIUFB]{Human (Klavekian)} from those three villages. The contents of an average stinkberry bush is enough to paste two medium humans. The effects last for seven days.</p>\n<h2>Fauna</h2>\n<p>The cold winters and short summers make the taiga a challenging habitat for reptiles and amphibians, which depend on environmental conditions to regulate their body temperatures, and there are only a few species in this part of the world. Some hibernate underground in winter.</p>\n<p>The @UUID[.U0BsD4hsNZmyzTxq#boreal-forest]{boreal forest} is home to a number of large herbivorous mammals, such as moose, reindeers, elks and caribous. There is also a range of rodent species including beavers, squirrels and some species of hares. Some larger mammals, such as bears, eat heartily during the summer in order to gain weight, and then go into hibernation during the winter. Other animals have adapted layers of fur or feathers to insulate them from the cold.</p>\n<p>The biggest herbivores in the region are the mammoth, the mastodon, the woolly rhino and its even bigger cousin, the elasmotherium. Unlike to the nearby plains, where they roam in vast herds, the forest contains but singles or families of those large animals.</p>\n<p>Predators like owls, eagles, foxes and weasels feed on rodents and are themselves sometimes hunted by the bigger predators. Those include the great cats like the lynx, snow leopards, cave lions, smilodons and white tigers and also by the wolverines, including their bearlike dire wolverine cousins. The wolves are a close second among the most variant hunters, ranging from normal wolves and terror wolves up to the dreaded dire wolves and winter wolves. Notable is also another great cat, the unique and stealthy missing lynx, the forest drake and the many-colored Ahlinni, a flightless predatory bird.</p>\n<p>Omnivores like bears, dire bears (cavebears) and raccoons are present also.</p>\n<p>Insects have also carved their niche in the northern forest, and not only the swarms of flying pests that fill the summer airs. Monstrous insects in the north are the feared white-and-silver, cold generating gelid beetles, which come in small and large variants, the giant tarantula spider and the dreaded weaverworm, which many sages count under Aberrations also.</p>\n<p>Rumors speak of a green dragon in the forest, or a white one in variants, and also a few linnorms, but if such large predators are indeed living in the regions no one has survived an encounter with them yet. No rumor are the large taiga giants who roam the forest to hunt the megafauna.</p>\n<h2>Fey</h2>\n<p>Surprisingly Fey are rare in the boreal forest at the @UUID[JournalEntry.ismpCNWpGHvB1iPw.JournalEntryPage.Erya8w29cRTTJELu]{Serpent Lake}, with the Mimi the sole exception. Sage speculate that they were driven out by their brethren in the @UUID[JournalEntry.ismpCNWpGHvB1iPw.JournalEntryPage.zUmf61j380tilNZt]{Dark Wood} further north, but why this may have happened, if at all, nobody knows or talks about. The Mimi are gathered in tribes of up to 80 fey and could be a big force in such numbers if they ever chose to.</p>\n<p>A few Kitsune families are known to live in the forest, but they give the Mimi tribes a wide berth.</p>\n<p>Some people count the dweomercats as well as the fey wolverines as faeries. While the fey wolverine is more undisputed in this category and even has a fitting name, the dweomercat is a creature of the first world. How it got to the Klavekian lands at all is the stuff of many discussions.</p>\n<p>Another creature of dubious origin is the smoke haunt who attacks woodcutters and others emerging from their campfire. A local tale, sung by the skalds of the three villages at the Serpent Tail River, tell a story linking it to the fey, but if this is fictitious or based on facts is up to discussion.</p>\n<h1>Government</h1>\n<p> </p>\n<img style=\"display:block;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto\" src=\"modules/aaw-games-aventyr/Setting-images/sm-Serpent_Lake_Region-Grid-768x960.webp\" width=\"447\" height=\"773\" />\n<p> </p>\n<img style=\"float:right;margin:0px 10px 10px 0px;border:0px\" src=\"modules/aaw-games-aventyr/Setting-images/Vikmordere-Warrior-Wizard-Marak-the-Raven-480x584.webp\" width=\"257\" height=\"313\" />\n<p>The Vikmordere are loosely organized in groups or tribal clans of 50 or more per encampment.

These people now collectively make up what the Vikmordere call the “@UUID[Compendium.Aventyr-Campaign-Setting.aventyr-campaign.dOJJ8mRNTPtoihmF.JournalEntryPage.l22xqVPei8b2u04P]{Ancestor Spirit}” which drives everything they do.</p>\n<p>As legend has it, the Ancestor People lived in this world long ago and used amazing magic to travel the entire world and shape it as they saw fit. They made the mountains, the rivers, the forests, and the streams and then they began to build cities. Over many generations, the Ancestor People lost touch with Nature and the world they created, instead opting to live in cities and laying waste to the gifts their ancestors forged for them.</p>\n<p>Finally, a wise man came from the south who had not forgotten the ways of their people. He saved the Ancestor People from plagues and famines and taught them to hunt and gather in the forests and live free in the world. Within just a few generations, the people had returned to their former life. At this time a pledge was made with Mother Nature to always protect and respect her ways and to join her spirit force when one dies. Thus the Ancestor Spirit began to grow and evolve; now it is strong and the wild world lives again. The Vikmordere will never lose their way in the world and will fight to stay free and destroy the “city people” and their evil ways.</p>\n<h1>Religion</h1>\n<p> </p>\n<img style=\"float:right;margin:0px 10px 10px 0px;border:0px\" src=\"modules/aaw-games-aventyr/Setting-images/Vikmordere-Spirit-Stones-480x579.png\" width=\"228\" height=\"276\" />\n<p>@UUID[JournalEntry.dOJJ8mRNTPtoihmF.JournalEntryPage.l22xqVPei8b2u04P]{The Ancestor Spirit} guides all of the Vikmordere people and asks them to respect the land, mountains, trees, animals, and plants of the world.</p>\n<p>Totem poles are carefully crafted by woodworkers under the guidance of the Tribal Shamans and raised to give praise to the animals of the wilderness for their gifts to the world.

The great powers of the Ancestor Spirit manifest themselves in both healing and druidic magic wielded only by the elders who have achieved enlightenment through great quests.</p>\n<p>Shamans are widely respected by all Vikmordere and never attacked unless they have gone rogue.

Most gold retained by the Vikmordere comes from raids in @UUID[JournalEntry.QVrlu0lTv2vFtT5P]{Klavekian} land.

They then return to their ships with the spoils and finish off the last section of the river which eases them into the ocean. Using the natural currents, the ships are pulled back into an inlet which leads to underground cavernous waterways. From this point the Vikmordere use a tribal secret that only the tribal elders that navigate the ships are allowed to see. Leading a crew of rowing Vikmordere men, the elders summon the @UUID[JournalEntry.dOJJ8mRNTPtoihmF.JournalEntryPage.l22xqVPei8b2u04P]{Ancestor Spirit} to show them the way to the Ancestral Gateway – a powerful permanent portal deep in the water-filled caverns.

The rugged island hosts a mix of black spruce and white pine, while birches, poplars and willows display beautiful fall colors starting in early autumn. Evenings are made memorable by breathtaking sunsets, whilst on clear nights there always is the likelihood of a appearance of the northern lights. The northern part of Crow’s Rest Island is bounded by spectacular red granite cliffs and coves that give the appearance of being magical and are mostly unexplored by humans as of now. They are inhabited by kobolds, but that may not always have been the case, since there are far older ruins on the island. The kobolds don’t look favorably on other humanoids rummaging around there and to prove this point, they leave shrunken heads and spread-eagled skeletons pinned to the cliffs. But even if they somehow could be avoided, there are also grim repositories of long-undead creatures and worse, if tales can be believed. Like so often in the North, what looks like a stunning paradise at first glance is actually only hiding its dangers behind mirages.</p>\n<p>The western sector of the island is flat, while almost mountainous relief is characteristic of the eastern part and accounts for about 70 per cent of the total area. Although absolute heights are low, the hills have steep, dissected slopes where only the sparsest vegetation and the hardiest goats manage to eek out survival.</p>\n<h2>Fauna</h2>\n<p>Secluded bays provide some of @UUID[JournalEntry.ismpCNWpGHvB1iPw.JournalEntryPage.Erya8w29cRTTJELu]{Serpent Lake} most important waterfowl habitats, and, to the delight of every fisherman with the courage to brave the dangers of the sea serpents, they teem with lake trout and northern pike. While golden and bald eagles abound, Crow’s Rest Island is known for its migratory bird life, aside from the name-giving crows, there are ducks, geese and loons as fellow summer visitors.</p>\n<p>Terrestrial mammals are mainly linked with the forest: brown bear, wolves, foxes, sable, and red squirrels have crossed the ice in especially cold winters and made a home on the island. Foxes are ubiquitous, and without the crows, it would in all likelihood have been known as the ‘island of foxes’ long ago. Such abundance of this species has provoked rumors of Kitsune living here too, either impersonating most of the foxes or at least living among them in hiding. The existence of pond drinkers may be a clue toward this, but it is unproven nonetheless.</p>\n<p>Perhaps the most distinguishing feature of Crow’s Rest Island is the abundance of sea mammals which form beach colonies in the west. In addition to the sea lion and common seal, widespread in the Serpent Lake, there are colonies of two rare species, the six-legged Zantula (see below) and the giant sea otter. Crow’s Rest Island lies on one of the major migration routes of birds nesting in the North. More than two dozen bird species are known to pass and rest here in times. Marine birds and crows are particularly common and form extensive colonies on the coastal cliffs in the north and the forest respectively.</p>\n<p>The coastlines of the Crow’s Rest Island are plagued by almost all the creatures that are common to the Klavekian Lakeside, so you can see the details in that part. Further inland, forest creatures prevail, but since there is no megafauna on the island, the predators tend to be smaller here compared to the mainland. There’s no reason for adventurers to relax, though, for the predators like the wolves are known to hunt in packs and the kobolds are numerous and cunning. Some of the scaly humanoids have dire rat mounts, and there is at least one sorcerer, maybe an ice kobold, known to be on the island. There also are more undead than one would think, and they are not only inside the ancient ruins. Among these undead, the cadavers have to be mentioned, for it seems to be very difficult to lay them to eternal rest. The kobolds usually avoid cadavers and the even more dangerous cadaver lords for this reason.</p>\n<p>The six-legged, vermin-like pond drinkers are rare around the Serpent Lake, but they are more common on Crow’s Rest Island. These blood drinkers are rumored to have banished the fey from the island, with the possible exception of the kitsune, and are now plaguing the kobolds and sometimes fishermen coming to close to the coastline.</p>\n<p>With its ability to prepare itself for long, cold winters by consuming huge quantities of aquatic insects, snails, small fish and fish eggs, and to survive for up to six months under several meters of ice if need be, the Zantula is well adapted to the Serpent Lake’s northern parts and likely to be found along shorelines and in shallower bays there. That it is so abundant this far south has made sages speculate if Crow’s Rest Island’s northern coves may be the long sought-after breeding ground for the strange mammals. Zantulas have an oily pelt which is surprisingly warm and gives a +2 on saving throws versus non-lethal cold damage. The oil vanishes three months after the harvesting though, and sooner if it is washed regularly. After two months, the pelt starts to stink, making its wearer and everyone downwind and closer than 20 feet distance nauseated as long as the pelt can be smelled. This can attract reefclaws, who are not above eating the occasional carcass, and the smell an old zantula pelt emits indeed reminds of a very old carcass.</p>\n<p>Sometimes known as the Vikmordere fish, because of its very large, brightly-spotted dorsal fin that reminds of a vikmordere sail, the alisfish is one of the most distinctive and attractive fish in northern waters. It is vividly colored, with an iridescent light purplish-blue back, and white sides. It also lives in the warmer parts of southern Klavekian rivers, but grows to trophy size in the cold, clear waters of Serpent Lake, reaching record weights of over four pounds, and super-lengths of 30 inches. Close study by fishermen of the alisfish’s habits has revealed that large specimen gravitate to deeper waters, with smaller fish inhabiting medium depths. Zantulas, seadrakes and tentamorts alike hunt the Alisfish, so it is very dangerous to compete with the latter monsters, but a small bay on the northern side of Crow’s Rest Island is known to be a location were it is easy to harvest Alisfish, if one survives the competition. It is very easy to bait the normally shy zantulas with alisfish to harvest their pelts (see above).</p>\n<h2>Flora</h2>\n<p>The coastline of Crow’s Rest Island is characterized by deep, clear waters and a shoreline dominated by mosses, lichens and low-growing shrubs. Further inland, black spruce, white pine and birches grow with the aforementioned spectacular colors in fall. On the western side, horsetails, sedges, wetlands filled with willows, and banks lined with mixed balsam poplar and spruce woods also provide ideal breeding habitats for ducks.</p>\n<p>Crow’s Rest Island is not known for its biological strangeness ,as most of the plants found here are common in the rest of the Klavekian realm.</p>\n<p>One exception for this is the elven berry, a highly nutritious, orange-colored fruit from the Klavekian willow, which is indigenous to the eastern shore of the southern @UUID[JournalEntry.ismpCNWpGHvB1iPw.JournalEntryPage.Erya8w29cRTTJELu]{Serpent Lake} and some of its islands. Despite being a little berry, the elven berry is considered by some to be one of the more useful foods found in the Klavekian realm today. It is a fruit having a short post-harvest period, after which it tends to deteriorate. That is why elven berry is available only as juice fruit pulp outside the North. This juice and pulp are used in numerous local beverages for its spicy taste, but a successful Craft (Alchemy) check DC 20 can produce a product that is able to enhance the normal eyesight for 20 feet for 2d6 rounds. Low-light or darkvision are not enhanced by the elven berry. The enhancing quality is the reason for the name of the berry, though a human still can’t compete with elven eyesight, however much elven berry beverage he has consumed.</p>\n<p>Another berry that bears mentioning here does it for warning purposes only. The saliberry is a blue fleshfruit with many seeds inside and has the size of an average sword pommel. Like the elven berry, it grows mainly on the southeastern part of Serpent Lake and some islands. Saliberries are thought by some to be a highly effective weight loss food, although no magic evidence exists to prove this statement. Indeed sages claim that consuming a certain amount of fresh saliberries causes the delusion of an immediate loss of weight, obviously some illusionary defense mechanism of the berry versus its natural enemies. The delusion lasts for about eight hours and can be disbelieved as usual. Victims of saliberries who want to believe in the fruits do get no saving throws, more sceptically minded eaters have to succeed a will saving throw DC 5. This is a mind-affecting (compulsion) effect. Saliberries have a bitter taste and are sometimes served with bloodhawkwings to complement the flavor.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n</div>","markdown":""},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"sort":0,"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}}],"flags":{"scene-packer":{"hash":"f4a22b344d6e36f05e7bf33382c00df35bfb095f","sourceId":"JournalEntry.Cg0Nt8mDPQ7JrmyB"},"cf":{"id":null},"core":{"sourceId":"Compendium.Aventyr-Campaign-Setting.aventyr-campaign.Cg0Nt8mDPQ7JrmyB"}},"_stats":{"systemId":"dnd5e","systemVersion":"2.1.4","coreVersion":"10.291","createdTime":1663427672675,"modifiedTime":1675797603086,"lastModifiedBy":"EsIYTtNnjwxUbKOG"},"_id":"Cg0Nt8mDPQ7JrmyB","ownership":{"default":0,"R5IsvMTH5P79pBoG":3},"folder":"j9cXBagzZ1ARsO2I","sort":400000},{"name":"Yerek Steppes","pages":[{"sort":100000,"name":"Yerek Steppes","type":"text","_id":"9qnqPShRDAbXxvDG","title":{"show":false,"level":1},"image":{},"text":{"format":1,"content":"<div class=\"aventyr\">\n<p class=\"s5\">Yerek Steppes</p>\n<img style=\"display:block;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto\" src=\"modules/aaw-games-aventyr/Setting-images/Yerek-Steppes-map.webp\" width=\"381\" height=\"574\" />\n<p>The Yerek Steppes are home to the Yerek people, a semi-nomadic group that moves north, closer to the @UUID[JournalEntry.b1DKjyyIAffVIzX1]{Scorched Lands}, in the winter and the southern border of the the steppes, near the sea, in the summer.

They have one week to complete this task.</p>\n<p>As the children are taught to make knives from flint and stone, the most successful return from their hunt bearing meat and skins and carrying knives made with handles from the antlers of the deer of the northern steppes or more formidable weapons made from the antlers of the elk and moose that live in the southern grasslands.</p>\n<p>Those that return with nothing or very little are relegated back to the status of child and are required to make the walk again before they take part in the hunt.</p>\n<p>Occasionally, a child does not return at all. In these cases, there is a twenty-four hour vigil held by the adults of the tribe. They are mourned and an offering of food and gifts are given to the parents, who are relieved of any tribal duties for one week.</p>\n<p>Other than the walk, the most recognized part of Yerek society is that the women of the tribe, down to the smallest infant girl, is considered a divine gift from Musta’Vohi. While men and women work side by side as equals, any serious decisions are made by the eldest female in attendance. If there is no female of age to have children present, the eldest male will make decisions.</p>\n<p>This does not mean that women in the tribe are treated as royalty. The opposite, in fact. They work just as hard as their male counterparts in all aspects of life. This is because the Yerek figured out long ago that everyone needed to work together if their people were to survive.</p>\n<p>Yerek children are taught survival skills at a young age. They learn things like how to hunt, farm, and live off of the land as well as how to make various weapons.</p>\n<p>Ariun Uudor is celebrated during the first week of each month. A single day of the week is set aside for a festive celebration honoring Musta’Vohi. Songs are sung and tales are told. Thanks are given for blessed unions and healthy children, while those who have had less than beautiful marriages still offer her supplication, so that they may have another chance to find love.</p>\n<p>Every male Yerek must also learn the gazar. These are capering dances performed while the dinner meal of Ariun Uudor is being prepared. Everyone changes their clothing into a bright, colorful outfit which is designed to present liveliness against the coming darkness. During the gazar, the women of the tribe sing the duu, songs of praise to Musta’Vohi, thanking her for their continued prosperity and to pray for easy, painless pregnancies, and healthy children.</p>\n<h2>Physical Characteristics</h2>\n<p>The Yerek people are, on average, short and stocky, looking like tall Dwarves to some. Occasionally, dweorg are found in Purus-thal as they travel from one place to another, which adds to the confusion. The Dwarves and the Yerek share many similarities in both attitude and outlook. While the Yerek are not a pessimistic people, the overwhelming attitude is “what will be, will be.”</p>\n<p>Both men and women of the Yerek stand approximately 5 feet tall, with slight various between 4’10” and 5’3″. Never in recorded Yerek history has there been anyone over 5’6″. The men usually weigh between 150 and 175 pound with the women being only slightly lighter.</p>\n<p>The men generally keep their hair short, usually, while the women usually wear theirs long although the opposite is seen as well . Hair is almost uniformly black, although very dark brown is not uncommon. Younger Yerek, especially those making their first walk, tend to have lighter hair due to sun exposure. Some women dye their hair with the juices of fruits, such as the anar for red or the ners for blue.</p>\n<p>Brown eyes are the most common color. Dark blue and dark green eyes make up about ¼ of the Yerek population, while lighter colors are almost nonexistent.</p>\n<h2>Farming</h2>\n<p>On the walk from end to end of the steppes, a large variety of ox called an uhker (oo-ker) is used to carry belongings. In general, these oxen are well-behaved, but do not tolerate cruelty for very long. Standing just over five feet tall at the shoulder, almost eight feet long, and weighing close to a full ton, these animals are respected by their drivers. Those that try to bully an uhker are often left in a bloody heap with broken bones.</p>\n<p>The uhker are also used in the western steppes near the border with the @UUID[JournalEntry.g4odaMsHbRkeNFhn]{Vast Swamp}. It is here that the Yerek grow crops to supplement their meat- and wheat-heavy diet. Uhker break apart the thick, heavy mud that make up the fields and their dung is used as fertilizer. In this area, wheat as well as thin-skinned peppers and a root vegetable called khunsni grow.</p>\n<p>The khunsni grows deep in the waterlogged soil while leaves float a few inches above on the waters surface. It can be eaten raw or chopped up and used in soup. It is sweet and crunchy when raw and adds a nutty flavor to soups.</p>\n<p>The pepper, called chinju, are bright green or red and spicy, but not overwhelming. They are also used in soups and for giving flavor to a variety of dried meats. Chinju can also be dried for storage and later use.</p>\n<p>Those that tend the fields tend to carry scythes or sickles, but clerics who help with the harvest use spiked chains altered to have small cutting blades. This allows them to harvest, but also to praise @UUID[JournalEntry.dOJJ8mRNTPtoihmF.JournalEntryPage.2wbAulHSDXQk55Q8]{Musta’Vohi} while using her favored weapon.</p>\n<h2>Technology</h2>\n<p>Given the spiciness of the chinju, the Yerek have found a way to use it as a deterrent to animals and the occasional person.</p>\n<p>The bladder of a dead uhker is taken and treated to keep the material supple. The juices and seeds of the chinju are ground up and dried. This is mixed together with water from the farmland in the west and then placed inside the bladder.</p>\n<p>A leaf from the khunsni is placed over the mouth of the bladder and has small holes poked through it.</p>\n<p>To use this device, called a shursh, the bladder is placed on the ground and stomped on or is smashed between the hands. The mixture of water and dried pepper is forced through the holes in the leaf, creating a mist that envelops a 10 foot cone in front of the bladder. The mist causing irritation to the eyes and sinuses, effectively blinding the opponent.</p>\n<p>Because walking the length of a country is hard on the feet, the Yerek needed some way to protect their feet on the journey. To do so, they have used the stomachs of uhker for adults or stomachs of small animals for children. They are filled with a thin later of a water and wheat dust mixture, making the water more viscous, and the stomach is sealed. The stomachs are then placed into the shoes to make walking more comfortable, as the syrupy fluid shifts back and forth with each step. A permanent mending spell is applied to these stomachs, preventing them from wearing out.</p>\n<h2>Magic</h2>\n<p>Arcane magic is virtually absent from the Yerek Steppes, but divine magic is present. This ability is generally found in the druids and rangers who look after the fields of the western steppes as they attempt to prevent wheat sickness from reappearing.</p>\n<p>Clerics follow @UUID[JournalEntry.dOJJ8mRNTPtoihmF.JournalEntryPage.2wbAulHSDXQk55Q8]{Musta’Vohi}and their role depends on how they decide to worship. If they are trained to be healers, they can be found either in the western swamps or in Purus-thal to aid with childbirth. Protectors journey with the tribesmen who walk the land.</p>\n<p>During Ariun Uudor, the clerics of that use Musta’Vohi’s ability to influence others to attempt to bring unmarried tribe members together.</p>\n<p> </p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"aventyr\">\n<h2>Significant Characters</h2>\n<p> </p>\n<h3>Grandmother Theilda</h3>\n<p>(NE, Female Yerek (human), Adept 10) – Barely sixty years old, but her body has been worn down by the constant migration of her people.

These grasslands begin in the north, near the @UUID[Compendium.Aventyr-Campaign-Setting.aventyr-campaign.b1DKjyyIAffVIzX1]{Scorched Lands} with a hardy grass that has evolved to combat the heat that is generated when the Shard of the Sun passes overhead. This grass is called kuchtei, which means “strong” in Yerek. The kuchtei extends approximately five miles from the Scorched Lands border.</p><p>As the land descends from the north the grasses become more temperate, with longer stalks. During the day, as the Shard of the Sun approaches in its orbit and after it passes by, a strong, hot wind blows hard through the kuchtei and into what is known as the sahlsdeg, or wavy grass. The motion of the grasses in the wind are mesmerizing to watch, especially as the heat from the passing Shard causes ripples in the air above the grass. This effect occurs within a couple of miles from the kuchtei. There is no mechanical effect in the game due to this phenomena, but the Yerek will sometimes pause in their walking and face the hot wind, allowing it to blow over them.</p><p>The center of the country is the most agriculturally diverse, with @UUID[.eOVkEXkbiSWbkVcp#treeland]{Treeland} to the east and waters from the @UUID[Compendium.Aventyr-Campaign-Setting.aventyr-campaign.g4odaMsHbRkeNFhn]{Vast Swamp} to the west providing opportunity to irrigate the land.

When she could no longer make the journey, she set up her tent, proclaiming it to be Purus-thal. Since that time, each Grandmother adds her own ger to the area surround the dwellings of the previous Mothers and Grandmothers. There are more structures than people who live in Purus-thal, which the Yerek are willing to rent out to travelers. The young women of the tribe who are due to give birth will stay in Purus-thal on their next passing and will inhabit Tani’s ger during the birthing process.</p><p>All babies born to the Yerek are raised in Purus-thal by a collaborative of all birth mothers, the Mothers, and the Grandmother</p><p>To the west, where the Steppes meet the Vast Swamp, is where most of the agriculture in the Yerek Steppes originates.

There are other fruit trees, grasses, and herbs in this area, but the idemkhii and lavender are the most prevalent.</p><h2>Treeland</h2><p>The eastern edge of the Yerek Steppes is known as Treeland.</p><p></p><p><strong>Flag:</strong> None</p><p><strong>Loyalty:</strong> Treeland</p><p><strong>Alignment:</strong> Chaotic Neutral</p><p><strong>Export:</strong> Fruit</p><p><strong>Import:</strong> None</p><p><strong>Assets:</strong> Unknown</p><p><strong>Population:</strong> Approximately five hundred thousand (88.5% primates (non-human), 10% other animals, .5% human)</p><p><strong>Authority Figure:</strong> @UUID[Compendium.Aventyr-Campaign-Setting.aventyr-campaign.dOJJ8mRNTPtoihmF.JournalEntryPage.jjNtg5QMfe2uI6uS]{Qathindli}</p><p></p><p>Treeland was founded roughly one hundred fifty years ago by Qathindli, demigoddess of monkeys.

These remnants of civilizations add to the uniqueness of the wasteland, creating a rich and layered reminder of entropy on the face of Aventyr.</p>\n<h2>History</h2>\n<p>Ages ago the events that created the wasteland known as the Scorched Lands were set in motion by a group of powerful mages from @UUID[JournalEntry.oVgfVPmxlNXfN3CW]{Timaeus}—the Obelisk Order. This penultimate group of spellcasters dared tempt the natural order of Aventyr and sought to control the power of the Sun, and the resulting catastrophe threatened to destroy the entire planet. The Obelisk mages had created a Shard of the Sun, infused with the essence of the great celestial body itself (a source of unimaginable and unlimited energy) but they were ill prepared to handle the power of a star and quickly realized their doom. The Shard that had been placed high above the planet began its plummet towards the surface and only by coming together was the Order able to avert disaster and repel the Shard of the Sun (but not before betrayal by one of their own). Unable to completely destroy their creation, they instead halted its decent and placed it in orbit around the planet. To this day the Obelisk Order performs a fell ritual each year to keep it at bay and soaring across the sky, though every rebuff costs each of them a piece of their humanity (and many question how long the mages will sacrifice themselves).</p>\n<p>@UUID[JournalEntry.oVgfVPmxlNXfN3CW.JournalEntryPage.EVR6caNc4jmcLjmb]{Mek’Madius}, the betrayer, attempted to assume the power of the Shard for himself. He turned on his brothers during their first critical ritual and almost succeeded in damning all of Aventyr, but the power of the sun proved too much for him to handle and his skin—some say his very soul—was burned off in the resulting backlash. The last sight the Obelisk Order had of him, Mek’Madius was a scorched husk fleeing into the desolation, thought to be a broken thing and a shadow of what he once was.</p>\n<p>In the centuries that followed what was left of the Obelisk Order built up a regimented, ordered society in Timaeus, far from the desolation they left behind in the Scorched Lands. Meanwhile, the Shard of the Sun decimated swaths of previously populated lands; hundreds of thousands perished across the region and entire civilizations fell. The mages had little choice in the location for the penultimate ritual to repel the Shard—the center of the continent was once a thriving land, rich in leyline power, people, and city states. As the great anomaly passes overhead daily, it enters the atmosphere above the Scorched Lands and releases its awesome power, burning and destroying the region, focused so strongly in this region that the Transgression incinerates nearly all it touches. As this is a daily occurrence, the power of the spell the Obelisk Order used to repel the Shard back into orbit wanes and each year it must be renewed immediately after @UUID[.P5eOWITiKf5XaG1a#the-shedding]{The Shedding}, when the mage-made artifact is at its weakest after releasing its full amount of energy in a burst many times more powerful than a normal Transgresion. Should they fail for any reason, the Shard of the Sun will plummet towards the surface and wreak untold havoc on Aventyr.</p>\n<p>Yet there was one who did not want the Order to succeed: Mek’Madius. By transferring his essence to the Shard of the Sun he became the Sun Lich, and for every soul the Shard burned into oblivion, his power grew. It was not long before he created hordes of undead from the corpses of the wastes, and in campaign after campaign, he exerted his wrath against the Timaens. While they have so far been able to suppress the undead armies, the Scorched Lands have remained quiet for nearly 500 years and many in the Obelisk Order fear that unstoppable incursion brews in the sands. The Sun Lich’s stronghold is located in the inhospitable @UUID[JournalEntry.oVgfVPmxlNXfN3CW.JournalEntryPage.OYj59KJky98HgcM7#the-deadlands]{The Deadlands} north of Timaeus, but rumors persist that Mek’Madius possesses a vast network of structures and strongholds throughout the Scorched Lands, their purpose a mystery to all.</p>\n<p>Modern history—where it can even be recorded—is dominated by feudal warlords that have eked out territory within the wastes, the @UUID[.xrdBOyM6RxMqDjyu#formian-queen]{Formian “Under Queen”} and her expansionist @UUID[.xrdBOyM6RxMqDjyu#council-of-the-hive]{Council of the Hive}, and the treasure-hungry @UUID[.xrdBOyM6RxMqDjyu#gnomish-kilknogger-compendium]{Gnomish Kilknogger Compendium} that aims to control the untapped riches of the wasteland (by any means available).</p>\n<h2>Naming</h2>\n<p>Naming conventions within the civilized settlements are as varied as the denizens of this land. Most human names are shortened variations on traditional names of the culture, or descriptors of services they provide.

Most find it advantageous to come together and form groups of survivalists that can effectively control a small town, a small area, or even larger territories in the Scorched Lands.</p>\n<h2>The Warlords</h2>\n<p>Throughout the Scorched Lands people of all types have endured; these extremely hardy folk find many reasons to tough out life in such a hostile land, from treasure hunting, sun magic farming, or simply the freedom and liberties the land naturally offers. While every man and woman in the Scorched Lands is beholden only to themselves for survival, there are those that seek to subjugate their fellows for personal gains—it is not uncommon for free towns to sprout up near valuable resources, and just as likely for a local bandit to assume the title of warlord and feudalize such encampments.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<img style=\"float:left;margin:0px 15px 15px 0px;border:0px\" src=\"modules/aaw-games-aventyr/Setting-images/Gladiator-247x300.webp\" width=\"247\" height=\"300\" />\n<p> Regardless of their origin, warlords are often dangerous and respected for their martial or arcane prowess as one cannot assume the title without the support of a band of loyal followers (though if they are loyal through respect or fear is another matter entirely). Many times their methods are the same—they aim to collect taxes and tithes from the working populace in exchange for territorial protection. Unfortunately, most tax their populations into situations of extreme poverty on purpose as to deny them the ability to mount an insurrection. Upon entering an encampment one can immediately surmise the nature of the town; if eyes dart to the ground and people flutter into shelters and avoid contact, it is probable that you have entered a warlord’s territory. Many times a local band will run a settlement in the absence of their warlord, and these lieutenants and sergeants are usually cruel and despicable of creatures (human or otherwise).</p>\n<p>While warlords tend to be cruel and maniacal, they are not above barter and reason. Many parley to find out what can be offered (if not taken by force) though caution is recommended when dealing with any warlord, as even the most charming leaders would not hesitate to strike a deal followed by a wicked and sudden betrayal. It is of no surprise that the warlords of the sands are in constant conflict with each other over resources and territory; incursions and clan wars are commonplace, deadly to both feudalistic regimes and the local populace. All of them unite in one respect, however: despising the @UUID[.xrdBOyM6RxMqDjyu#gnomish-kilknogger-compendium]{Gnomish Kilknogger Compendium}, viewing them as foreign invaders. Mutants are a touchy subject between individual warlords and while some accept them with open arms, others kill survivors of the Shard on sight. All warlords, and for that matter everyone in the Scorched Lands, fears the @UUID[.xrdBOyM6RxMqDjyu#formian-queen]{formians} and their Underqueen.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>Formian Queen</h2>\n<p> </p>\n<img style=\"float:right;margin:0px 15px 15px 0px;border:0px\" src=\"modules/aaw-games-aventyr/Setting-images/AAW-Formian-color-01-267x300.webp\" width=\"267\" height=\"300\" />\n<p>The last remaining formian matriarch on Aventyr, the Underqueen assumed the title by subjugating all other royal peers on the planet (a meticulous process that took eons to accomplish). Having come to the Scorched Lands before the burning to dominate her kin in the area, she launched a long-running and massive campaign against them resulting in the Formic Wars—an epic struggle lost to the legends and lore of the present age. As the sole queen, she is responsible for all formian behavior. While typically content in her dominance of the formians of Aventyr, the Underqueen’s ambition and patience border on true evil and rival the cunning of a high demon lord; her current goals are numerous and vast in scope, and some of them involve the surface world.</p>\n<p>No one knows the true location of the main hive (which some say extends throughout Aventyr and even beyond) but nest exits can be spotted in the Scorched Lands by their tower like protrusions from the sands. These spires of mounded dirt and grit extend into the sky at least dozens of feet and sometimes scores (with certain structures said to soar over a hundred feet into the sky). From these spires formian workers and warriors often attack settlements in search of slaves, food, or silver. No one knows what the formians want with such vast quantities of argent metal, but it is often stated that even a few pieces of silver can save your life from one of the brutal insects.</p>\n<p>While formic invasions on a large scale are extremely rare, the people of the Scorched Lands always retain the primal fear of insect hordes marching across the badlands. The machinations of the Underqueen are not for mortals to question, however, and those that have are seldom seen from again.</p>\n<h2>Council of the Hive</h2>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The Council of the Hive is a collection of formian myrmarchs that act as the direct administrative force for the Underqueen; though she can command each of her subjects individually or all of them collectively, it is often more efficient to outsource her commands to loyal, direct subordinates to carry out the minutia of details and day to day tasks. These formians are the rarest of exceptions within the hive castes. They are individuals in every sense, with their own thoughts and ambitions, and though beholden to the Underqueen their loyalty to her is never entirely assured. While this may seem like an imbalance in an otherwise orderly system, the necessity to alleviate the psychic load from her highness supersedes their innate compulsion for conformity. Thus the myrmarchs make up an elite, noble caste of hive society and act as high ranking officials in domestic and military matters.</p>\n<h2>Cult of the Hive</h2>\n<p> </p>\n<img style=\"float:right;margin:0px 15px 15px 0px;border:0px\" src=\"modules/aaw-games-aventyr/Setting-images/cult-of-the-hive-symbol-293x300.png\" width=\"236\" height=\"242\" />\n<p> A group of humanoids that worship the @UUID[.xrdBOyM6RxMqDjyu#formian-queen]{Underqueen} as a living god. the Cult of the Hive (or Indoctrinated as they call themselves) are always accompanied by a dominated formian slave under the direct control of a formian taskmaster. While the taskmaster does not need to be present, this special connection is rumored to extend directly to the Underqueen’s will. Anyone can join the ranks by passing an indoctrination ritual—those who succeed in the taskmaster’s eyes are promoted to fully dominated slaves. The highest-ranking officials in the Cult of the Hive’s hierarchy are slaves passed directly to myrmarchs and given free will.</p>\n<p>The Cult of the Hive acts primarily as an infiltration and information gathering unit for the formians, but they are also tasked with carrying out more indiscreet actions for which the Underqueen does not wish her formians directly involved. The group uses a symbol to designate private areas, sometimes left as a calling card—a six-pointed radial inside a circle representing the legs of an ant surrounded by the all-encompassing, all-seeing queen.</p>\n<h2>Gnomish Kilknogger Compendium</h2>\n<p>The GKC is part trading-company, part mercenary-group, but wholly corrupt. Barter is the language of their trade with an emphasis on cold, hard, gold. Known everywhere as the Water Barons, the GKC was established centuries ago by Klaxon Kilknogger as an enterprising expedition into the Scorched Lands in order to harvest the powers of @UUID[.P5eOWITiKf5XaG1a#sun-magic]{Sun Magic} directly. In the early days of the Compendium research and development trumped all other concerns, and their discoveries led to a rise in survivability and quality of life in the Scorched Lands. The GKC was the first to develop sun oil (and subsequently, the cool suits), and they cultivated the waternut trees and firegrass into an agricultural boon. Well-respected pioneers in the region, the countless other inventions they’ve developed (both great and small) have been an undeniable boon to the peoples of the sands (despite whatever ill will may be harbored against them today).</p>\n<p>Whatever respite from the harshness of life in the wasteland the GKR initially offered, much of it faded away when Klaxon Kilknogger died in a terrible accident and the family-run business destroyed itself from the inside. Eventually, Nitpik Kilknogger assumed control through force and his great-grandson, Filk Nitpik Kilnogger III, runs the Compendium to this day—for all his shortcomings, Filk possesses a business mind unmatched in all of Aventyr.</p>\n<p>Their main source of income for the last two centuries has been the water refinery on the southern shore of the Grave Morass. The GKC has developed technology able to affordably transform the crude sludge of the Morass into clean, drinkable water using the power of Sun Magic, which they then sell to badland settlements. Anyone trying to farm waternuts is harassed, and entire orchards are cut down in retribution for even planting more than what a farmer has negotiated to sow. Towns are visited regularly by GKC tax sheriffs, usually escorted by chained and bound fire elementals—unsurprisingly, they always get paid and rarely hesitate to extort someone for more than their due. Until recently these tariffs have been manageable, but lately, the merchants have been taxing more and more while rationing less and less water.</p>\n<h2>Mutants</h2>\n<p>The western portion of the Scorched Lands consists of a massive series of canyons, mesas, and plateaus collectively called the Fissures. This confusing landscape is perfectly suited to the reclusive lifestyle led by the many mutant clans who inhabit this area.</p>\n<img style=\"float:left;margin:0px 15px 15px 0px;border:0px\" src=\"modules/aaw-games-aventyr/Setting-images/rick-hershey-resistance-leader-alchemist-214x300.png\" width=\"214\" height=\"300\" />\n<p>  Most mutants are (or at least were) humans at one point but it is not uncommon to see evidence of the other races—their mutations are often aesthetic only, with very few having any positive benefit from their transformation. Their changes are as varied and diverse as one can imagine, ranging from saggy skin to multiple eyes, and other physical deformities.</p>\n<p>The power of the Shard of the Sun can often mutate a normal individual instead of destroying them. Sometimes even a glancing bit of energy from its passing, over time, creates minor mutations (see the Table SL-2: @UUID[RollTable.slkHPusSFQUmHL9P]{Transgression Mutations}s for possible mutations). In @UUID[JournalEntry.oVgfVPmxlNXfN3CW]{Timaeus} magical experimentation has led to the creation of mutant slave trade; many of these individuals are more intelligent and escape to freedom in the Fissures to rally others behind their causes. Some escapees have set up an elaborate and complicated system of ferrying their brethren from bondage, a nuisance that many in @UUID[JournalEntry.oVgfVPmxlNXfN3CW.JournalEntryPage.iUOrRhLyDdg71ghA]{Nyamo} have complained of for decades (though when they might respond is anyone’s guess).</p>\n</div>","markdown":""},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{"core":{"sheetClass":""}}},{"sort":300000,"name":"Culture","type":"text","_id":"AI7YhJjs53JTENcc","title":{"show":false,"level":1},"image":{},"text":{"format":1,"content":"<div class=\"aventyr\"><p class=\"s5\">Culture</p><p>The collective peoples of the Scorched Lands call themselves Pilgrims, and it is customary to greet folk with this term as a sign of respect and kinship (though other groups identify with whatever term best describes them: wastewalkers, mutants, nomad, and the like.) It takes a hard soul to warrant a life in what many in Aventyr call the worst place in the world, and these rugged individuals pride themselves on it. Life here is governed by a strict sense of survival and mutual respect—most settlements have rudimentary laws that keep the peace amongst the collective people while letting personal and property disputes be handled amongst the parties invested.</p><p>Few people journey into the Scorched Lands let alone travel out and as a consequence, the Common tongue has become antiquated, formed into a mix of formality and turns of phrase unique to the area. This can be a complication of nuance in a land where a wrong look could turn deadly, making speaking a game of sizing up a potential friend or foe as well as a matter of wit. It is fully customary to refer to individuals with the appropriate prefix (such as Mister, Misses, or Miss) unless on a first name basis, though sometimes then as well.</p><h3>Gods</h3><p>There are no gods unique to the Scorched Lands; each culture developed an understanding of the world through survival and most know that it was magic that made the land this way, not deities. Peoples and settlements tend to retain some of their original cultural identity, and shrines exist to all manners of divine beings, be they human, elf, or mutant. Religious temples in the Scorched Lands are extremely rare sights, usually devoted and built to a passing deific fad or cult and with time or warfare, the originators die off or leave behind a shell of a building much like the land itself</p></div>","markdown":""},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}},{"sort":400000,"name":"Geography","type":"text","_id":"GDlRxCWyVIxqhfBR","title":{"show":false,"level":1},"image":{},"text":{"format":1,"content":"<div class=\"aventyr\">\n<p class=\"s5\">Geography</p>\n<p>The Scorched Lands cover a swath of territory in the center of Aventyr and although the Shard of the Sun orbits the entire planet, only here does its power interact physically with the world. The region’s outside borders are transition zones and assume many of the features from their parent climate, but as one moves into the interior the landscape quickly transforms into a desolate wasteland devoid of most life. During the daytime hours temperatures typically range from 90° to 120° Fahrenheit (32–48° C) as in a normal desert climate, whereas at night some places can fall to as low as 40° Fahrenheit (4° C); it is rare for temperatures to rise or fall beyond these norms (and when they do, it is often because of the Transgression).</p>\n<p>The Shard of the Sun passes overhead twice daily, once around midnight and again around noon, always 12 hours apart (on a semi sun-synchronous orbit). As the planet rotates below the Shard is always between it and the sun during noon (or midnight) local time. The Transgression, as it is formally called, takes approximately one hour from the time the Shard appears on the eastern horizon until it passes completely under the western sky. During the Transgression a bright “second sun” appears in the sky, emanating waves of heat and bright light; as the Shard reaches the apex of the noon sky temperatures rise drastically, reaching upwards of 240° Fahrenheit (115° C). Fortunately, these extreme temperatures last for only “the dead 6’s”, (66 seconds) as the Shard passes directly overhead and the surface experiences the full blast of its power. This burning heat can be endured as long as one takes shelter, or finds cover from the direct rays of the Shard; the nightly passing of the Shard has no adverse effects as it receives no power from the sun.</p>\n<p>The landscape of the Scorched Lands is mostly desert wasteland, as any viable topsoil burned off centuries ago—dust, sand, and ash cover everything. The vegetation and plant life common to other climates are practically nonexistent, and only stone structures remain unclaimed by the scorching sands, remnants of structures that eerily outline the shapes of houses, mills, and other buildings. These corpses of civilization act as a reminder that once people did thrive here, but any life that remains has adapted to survive in this harsh environment.</p>\n<p>Even in this desolate destruction, there is diversity, however, in variations of life that speaks to the tendency for Aventyr’s denizens to survive despite whatever assails them. The northern reaches of the Scorched Lands are dominated by the Sea of Shards, endlessly shifting sand dunes dotted with strange ashen stalagmites that rise from the dunes. The central region comprises the Grave Morass, a vast pit filled with congealed ash, sand, and oil (a geographical formation unlike anything on Aventyr). The western Scorched Lands comprise a series of giant canyons and badland formations named by locals as the Fissures; primarily inhabited by mutants, this region is virtually unexplored. To the east, bordering the sea, are the salt flats of Water’s End and it’s said that anything composed of water that enters the territory never leaves in the same form.</p>\n<h2>Cities &amp; Settlements</h2>\n<p> </p>\n<h3>Ravine</h3>\n<p>Built into the crust of Aventyr in the central portion of the Scorched Lands is the city of Ravine, the largest settlement of the region. Hovels and dwellings crowd the sides of the busy canyon walls, while the surface level is left almost completely barren save for the sheltered guard posts and canyon lifts.. At the lowest level a stream of fresh, cool water runs throughout the canyon floor, created from a natural aquifer deep underground that runs south and west into the fissures. Pilgrims of all sorts have lived and survived here for centuries, each generation building dwellings closer and closer to the surface as space becomes more limited. The most prized and ancient of dwellings near the canyon floor are sought after and conspired for, often in the nearby market level’s giant lifts (spaced sporadically throughout to ferry goods to and from the surface on giant rock-counterweight scales). Silver plated reflectors set up along the sides of some of the canyon walls reflect sunlight into special cutout terraces that, with irrigation from the stream, provide food for the citizens.</p>\n<p>Ravine is run by an elected mayor that serves a five-year term and all positions of power within the city are elected officials or appointed by the mayor.</p>\n<h2>Flora and Fauna</h2>\n<h3>Nightbloom Acacia</h3>\n<p>Named for its ability to bloom at night and absorb moisture from the air, this plant is dormant for most of the day, its small flat leaves sprouting near sunset and staying open until dawn to draw in moisture. The nightbloom acacia has a thick light brown bark that grows to a thickness of many inches to protect from the Shard’s rays and blooms once a month during the full moon, the resulting flowers prized for their use in fragrances and dyes. Because of the Shedding, most trees do not exceed 8 ft. in height.</p>\n<h3>Firebloom Cactus / Shader Tree</h3>\n<p> </p>\n<img style=\"float:right;margin:0px 15px 15px 0px;border:0px\" src=\"modules/aaw-games-aventyr/Setting-images/firebloom-cactus-reduced_-240x300.webp\" width=\"240\" height=\"300\" />\n<p>This brown-skinned cacti is covered in small hairs and smells reminiscent of honey. The medium-sized center trunk of a firebloom cactus blossoms out into a thick, bulbous overgrowth that extends up to 10 ft. high and with branches 5 ft. long that form an outgrowth that protects from the Shard’s rays, shading the relatively delicate trunk. Once a day during the Transgression flowers open atop the canopy and seemingly absorb the Shard’s rays before sulking back into the outgrowth. Shader trees are rare and valued for protection they obviously offer, and are often confused with the deadly corpse cactus.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<h3>Corpse Cactus / Dead Man’s Rest</h3>\n<p> </p>\n<img style=\"float:left;margin:0px 15px 15px 0px;border:0px\" src=\"modules/aaw-games-aventyr/Setting-images/corpse-cactus-reduced-240x300.webp\" width=\"240\" height=\"300\" />\n<p> This plant closely resembles its cousin, the firebloom cactus, but though it has a similar size and shape as well as brown skin, short hairs, and an odor of honey, it offers anything but safe respite. Once a creature touches the trunk and brushes up against the hairs of this desert flora, spines shoot out from inside the trunk (Atk +2, 1d2 points of piercing damage + DC 15 Fortitude save or paralyzed and 1d3 Constitution drain per round). Once injected into the victim the spines inject a paralytic poison that traps the creature in place while the tree siphons all nutrients and when its prey is unconscious or dead, the overgrowth on the tree opens and vine-like tendrils grab the body, slowly pulling it up and placing it prone on top of the corpse cactus. Here the plant sucks the victim bone dry, adding the remaining bulk to its “sun shield”.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h3>Waternut Tree</h3>\n<p>Of the little vegetation that persists in the Scorched Lands, the waternut tree is arguably the most important plant of them all. This tall (15-20 ft.) thorny, thin, leafy tree produces hanging sacks of an edible nut used heavily in wasteland cuisine. The top of the tree has giant, white leaves that canopy the trunk and fruits during a Transgression, following the Shard like a sunflower.</p>\n<p>The sack of a waternut is more valuable than the nut itself, as approximately 2 gallons of fresh water can be found within. One tree can produce as many as 10 hanging sacks (the fruiting time is approximately 5 days) by utilizing a symbiotic relationship with fire grass, an algae always found around the plants. The waternut tree uses its white leaves to capture the rising steam from the fire grass and it cools the underside of the large leaves as it condenses, protecting the leaf but also allowing it to absorb the extra water. One waternut sack of water is capable of producing a 15 ft.-wide patch of fire grass (and therefore capable of producing at least 5 more waternuts).</p>\n<h3>Fire Grass / Fire Algae</h3>\n<p>Fire grass is an algae that grows symbiotically with the waternut tree, covering the ground around the plant in a 15-ft.-radius patch that resembles a low grass or moss, but with a rust or reddish hue. Absorbing water from the waternut sacks when they fall to the ground, fire algae undergoes a process called photosynthetic replication, reproducing astonishingly fast with very little consumed energy. When the Transgression occurs, fire grass’ high water content burns off before the algae itself, releasing steam all around the waternut tree. Fortunately, fire algae is not harmful to most creatures, though it often convinces creatures and travelers unfamiliar with the Scorched Land that the water from a waternut tree is not to be trusted.</p>\n</div>","markdown":""},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{"core":{"sheetClass":""}}},{"sort":650000,"name":"Regional Unique Characteristics","type":"text","_id":"P5eOWITiKf5XaG1a","title":{"show":false,"level":1},"image":{},"text":{"format":1,"content":"<div class=\"aventyr\">\n<p class=\"s5\">Regional Unique Characteristics</p>\n<h2>Weather</h2>\n<p>As normal weather patterns pass into the Scorched Lands they quickly dissipate in the intense heat over the sands, sometimes disappearing without a trace but not always; it is not unheard of for powerful rain and thunderstorms to rip through the region whipping up dust walls, ash clouds, and even leaving pools of ashen sludge that can swallow unsuspecting travelers. In areas that receive heavier amounts of rain the ash and sand congeal to form semiliquid lakes of viscous slag called morasses.</p>\n<p>The Transgression over very wet environments such as large bodies of water, oceans, and swamps, has effects that are somewhat unique. The rapid rise in temperature produces a large amount of steam and water vapor, and the heat currents can often cause steam spouts to form—these tornadoes of vaporized boiling water are quite dangerous and have been known to sink many a ship. In general, the Transgression over water creates a tremendous amount of airborne moisture, most of which becomes steam that creates a thick mid-level fog that helps to abate the power of the Transgression near the cost. In swampy areas, this increased moisture creates a super-dense growth zone on the immediate border of the Transgression path, and many areas downwind of a seaside zone are incredibly lush and fertile, having daily tropical rainstorms creating a perfect environment for an abundance of plant and animal life in an otherwise inhospitable region.</p>\n<h2>Dangers and Effects</h2>\n<p>While the Shard of the Sun scorches the land below and destroys most life, a strange residual effect occurs in the Scorched Lands where its touch graces Aventyr—the entire zone is affected by a permanent endure elements spell. Any creature that spends at least 10 minutes in the Scorched Lands’ borders are affected by this phenomena and it lasts until 24 hours are spent outside of the zone, minimizing any heat dangers except during the direct Transgression (dangerous temperatures only exist for 5 minutes before and after the Shard’s direct passing; no environmental checks are required outside of this time.) During this daily period of intense heat, Fortitude saves against the environment need to be made by creatures involved in strenuous activities (such as combat) in an exposed area but are otherwise unnecessary. During the direct Transgression as temperatures rise to greater than 240° F (115° C), unprotected creatures must make a Fortitude Save (DC 15 +1 per previous check) or take 10d6 points of damage (half damage on a successful save). Half of this damage is considered fire damage and the other half is untyped. The direct Transgression lasts for 66 seconds (11 rounds). Any creature slain by the Shard must make a DC 20 Will save or be affected by the Ashen Death (see Table SL-1: Ashen Death).</p>\n<p>@UUID[RollTable.ehxz2lMba6C4yRdL]{Ashen Death}, @UUID[RollTable.slkHPusSFQUmHL9P]{Transgression Mutations}</p>\n<h2>Ashen Template (CR varies)</h2>\n<p> </p>\n<img style=\"float:right;margin:0px 15px 15px 0px;border:0px\" src=\"modules/aaw-games-aventyr/Setting-images/scorched-lands-transgression-jpeg.webp\" width=\"279\" height=\"192\" />\n<p> When a creature other than an undead is destroyed by the Shard of the Sun, it has a chance to rise as an unintelligent undead zombie with the ashen template.

Back in their homelands they celebrate a festival day but in reality, a dark truth lies below the joyful tidings—the magic that keeps the Shard of the Sun in orbit around the planet fades over time and only the ritual performed during the Shedding keeps the Shard from crashing into the planet, destroying all life. While it has gone uninterrupted for over a thousand years each time it is always marked by terrible death and suffering among the elite of Timaeus.</p>\n<p>A normal Transgression lasts for 66 terrifying seconds, but a Shedding lasts for an excruciating 666 seconds and bake the surface with such an immense heat that no tool has survived measuring it (though estimates place the temperature between 600° and 800° F (315–426° C). Low-quality swords and armor have been known to melt to slag, anything made of wood instantly combusts, and unprotected objects vaporize into ash.</p>\n<p>After a Shedding, the earth is cracked and parched dry, like the shedding scales of a world-sized snake. The first winds bring about terrible ash storms that have lasted for days. Even worse are Morasses, formed when rainstorms sweep in after a Shedding (turning all that ash to liquid stone). If there was any benefit at all to the Shedding it is that after it ends, fresh pools of sun magic can be harvested all over the Scorched Lands.</p>\n<h3>Sun Magic</h3>\n<p> </p>\n<img style=\"float:right;margin:0px 15px 15px 0px;border:0px\" src=\"modules/aaw-games-aventyr/Setting-images/AAW-IgneaousGlaive-color-01-193x300.webp\" width=\"193\" height=\"300\" />\n<p>Sun magic is a remnant of The Shedding, energy so dense that it takes physical form as a glowing orange liquid hot enough to burn unprotected skin (2d6 fire damage for each round of exposure). With careful preparation, however, it can be handled safely, charged into prepared crystals which other magical devices use as power. Though it can be found in the Scorched Lands where the magic of the obelisk ritual connects with the Shard, the rain of magic continues across the ocean into the deadlands and across northern Timaeus (and even further east into the ocean).</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h3>Protections Against the Shard</h3>\n<p>Many creatures have adapted to protect themselves from the harshness of the Shard’s rays, searching for ways to survive the yearly terror of the Shedding. Intelligent species were quick to adapt and many techniques for survival remain unchanged for centuries.</p>\n<p>Finding a zone of safety from the Shard (at least a 5 ft. square of full cover) can be a matter of life or death during a Transgression and though simply staying out of the direct rays of the Shard can save your life, without protections there is still great danger from exposure. While in cover with no other protections during a Transgression (which lasts 11 rounds) a creature takes 1d6 points of nonlethal damage per round.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<img style=\"float:right;margin:0px 15px 15px 0px;border:0px\" src=\"modules/aaw-games-aventyr/Setting-images/Celurian-Air-Scarf-276x300.webp\" width=\"217\" height=\"236\" />\n<h3>Cool Suit</h3>\n<p>A cool suit is any suit of clothing or armor treated in sun oil that specifically covers the entirety of the body and leaves nothing unprotected exposed. Most cool suits unfurl or unwrap to cover the body like a cape in time of need, whereas others are more intricate and tailor-made to an individual’s needs—be it extra appendages, equipment considerations, or personal tastes. Once treated in sun oil the suit protects the wearer from one full exposure of the Shard, after which the concoction flakes off and the suit is no longer protected until another coating is applied (because sun oil is costly, most folks treat a cool suit as a last resort). A cool suit offers no protection against a Shedding.</p>\n<h3>Deathbed</h3>\n<p>Honed over the centuries, one of the oldest techniques for survival in the Scorched Lands is the deathbed. It entails digging a grave-like bed in the sand, laying in it, and covering oneself with at least 6 inches of material, you must have some way of breathing through the material. As the Transgression occurs temperatures rise, but underground a creature stays mostly protected. Anyone can make a deathbed within 10-12 rounds.</p>\n</div>","markdown":""},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{"core":{"sheetClass":""}}},{"sort":600000,"name":"Significant Characters","type":"text","_id":"D9UwvI6GT2kTh7UF","title":{"show":false,"level":1},"image":{},"text":{"format":1,"content":"<div class=\"aventyr\">\n<p class=\"s5\">Significant Characters</p>\n<h2> <span id=\"The_Fiery_Lady\" style=\"box-sizing:border-box\"><span style=\"font-family:Lato, sans-serif\">The Fiery Lady</span></span></h2>\n</div>\n<p><img style=\"float:right;margin:0px 15px 15px 0px;border:0px\" src=\"modules/aaw-games-aventyr/Setting-images/fire-lady-jazbee-110x300.webp\" width=\"110\" height=\"300\" /></p>\n<p> The Fiery Lady is a mystery of the Scorched Lands.
