Most frequently this is during war, where neither the unhelpful morality of good and evil nor the confusion and disorder of chaos allow for clear decisions to be made and victory achieved. The Axiomatic General appears wherever clear-thinking, considered tactics, and balanced plans are being prepared or followed. While the field of war is the usual site for these activities, the Axiomatic General has been known to appear during complicated but emotionless court cases, and sometimes even when the cold, detached clarity of true monkish enlightenment is reached.</p>\n<p>The Axiomatic General is neither male nor female, instead being a creature devoid of physically distracting bias. It can appear as a female or male of any humanoid species, whichever form is most likely to aid with clarity of decision making.</p>\n<h2>Dogma</h2>\n<p>The Axiomatic General and its followers wish to bring the clarity of law to those places that currently live in emotional turmoil and to demonstrate to all the axiomatic nature of law when applied to war, legal frameworks, and personal actions. It expects its believers to instigate and adhere to meaningful laws while at the same time exposing and amending those which are ludicrous, outlandish, convoluted, unenforceable, or contrary. The Overseer of War abhors any decision or process that allows an individual to take unfair advantage of another, either through methods such as emotional blackmail, the abuse of personal power, or as a result of chance. It encourages its followers to engage in long-term ordered âwarsâ rather than short-and-sharp fightsâthe chaos of battle is well known, but by carefully considering oneâs options, testing oneâs theories, and then following through with a well-conceived plan, one can make their way to victory in an ordered manner. If all around them are clear about their intentions, one can see their actions are as fair and just as possible, and that trade and public prosperity, the courts, and the growth of society as a whole can continue during even the greatest of conflicts.</p>\n<p>The Lord of All Wars promotes careful consideration in all matters and expects its followers to be able to provide self-evident truths for all their actions. Haste, guesswork, and self-indulgence lead to reliance on emotion and base, uncontrolled actions. It disapproves of reliance on government or any religious institution that fosters blind trust or, even worse, unprovable belief, explaining that those with sound judgement, mental discipline, and an unshakeable grasp of sensible, irrefutable laws can overcome the inauthentic evidence and invalid arguments of the emotional and chaotic masses.</p>\n<h2>History</h2>\n<p>Once a mortal humanoid, the Axiomatic General ascended to become deified, although it is unclear what exactly it once was as virtually all races have a legendary historical figure that has risen from the mortal ranks to those of the divine after following the path of a great warrior who tirelessly supported its deity. What is evident is that the Overseer of War became more powerful than this original deity and ended up judging it at the culmination of a long conflict. The Lord of All Warâs final verdict and victory provided the energy and evidence needed for the warrior to rise to godhood itself.</p>\n<p>The Axiomatic General tends to appear in history (as the simple warrior of its humanoid type) when the raceâs pre-eminent lawful deity first wages war against more than one non-lawful foe, whether they be good, evil, or chaotic. It goes by many titles (a few of which appear above) but always has the ability to make clear, concise, and entirely accurate decisions even in the heat and fog of combat. Tales invariably tell of the Overseer of War having to uphold the lawful aims and ambitions of another deityâs followers when the god or goddess itself proves to be weak and fallible. Then the Axiomatic General steps in to save those same worshipers before judging the god in question and finding it wanting. After this, it takes the fight to the enemy, turns the tide of the war with unquestionable judgement, and becomes a deity in its own right. After this, the Lord of All Wars is always found leading those who know its words to be the truth through conflict, disagreement, and disputeâa reliable route to absolute, undeniable victory.</p>\n<h2>Relationships</h2>\n<p>The Overseer of War is entirely dismissive of any and all other deities that do not in some part embrace lawful beliefs. While those that promote chaos feel its full wrath, the Axiomatic General constantly seeks to disprove the tenets of neutral good and neutral evil deities because of their reliance on sentimental or self-centred emotions. It tolerates lawful good and lawful evil gods as long as their lawful nature is at the forefront of their actions, and is just as likely to support a lawfully-minded archon in a conflict against an evil devil as it is a lawfully-minded devil that wages war against an overly-good archon; ultimately, the balance of law is what is important.</p>\n<p>The Axiomatic General is opposed by all those who promote personal choice, uncontrolled actions, and âbeliefââit is guaranteed to come into conflict with deities that support and nurture bards and barbarians, and frequently with those that nurture wild sorcerers. Because it is so closely linked with conclusive and categorical truth, the Lord of All Wars sometimes finds itself on the side of sages, experts, philosophers and academics that devote their lives to uncovering a lost or hidden truth, whether military, legal, commercial, or magical.</p>\n<h2>Appearance</h2>\n<p>The Axiomatic General usually appears as a healthy, vibrant member of the appropriate race and can be either female or male (or neither). Its clothing is always practical for the situation but is clearly designed to instil confidence and invariably a bright white. The godâs symbol, the decorated iron rod, is sewn into the space above the heart and mimicked by the weapon it wields. The Overseer of War always carries a +3 axiomatic brilliant energy light mace, the look and effect of which are in line with the main domain of the senior cleric in the vicinity as follows:</p>\n<table style=\"float:left;width:99.5833%;height:113px\" border=\"1\">\n<tbody>\n<tr style=\"height:32.5px\">\n<td style=\"width:47.7664%;height:32.5px;background-color:#000000;border-color:#ffffff\">\n<h3><span style=\"color:#ffffff\"><strong>Domain</strong></span></h3>\n</td>\n<td style=\"width:52.2358%;height:32.5px;background-color:#000000;border-color:#ffffff\">\n<h3><span style=\"color:#ffffff\"><strong>Rod type</strong></span></h3>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height:20.125px\">\n<td style=\"width:47.7664%;height:20.125px;background-color:#ecf0f1;border-color:#000000\">Law</td>\n<td style=\"width:52.2358%;height:20.125px;background-color:#ecf0f1;border-color:#000000\">Alertness</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height:20.125px\">\n<td style=\"width:47.7664%;height:20.125px;background-color:#ecf0f1;border-color:#000000\">Nobility</td>\n<td style=\"width:52.2358%;height:20.125px;background-color:#ecf0f1;border-color:#000000\">Splendour</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height:20.125px\">\n<td style=\"width:47.7664%;height:20.125px;background-color:#ecf0f1;border-color:#000000\">Strength</td>\n<td style=\"width:52.2358%;height:20.125px;background-color:#ecf0f1;border-color:#000000\">Flailing</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height:20.125px\">\n<td style=\"width:47.7664%;height:20.125px;background-color:#ecf0f1;border-color:#000000\">War</td>\n<td style=\"width:52.2358%;height:20.125px;background-color:#ecf0f1;border-color:#000000\">Rulership</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>Legends dictate that the Axiomatic General occasionally appears as a fully advanced, adamantine-coated marut, but the last occasion this was recorded was many generations ago.</p>\n<h2>Providence</h2>\n<p>Followers and clergy of the Lord of All Wars know that clarity of planning, deeper understanding of the way forward, or insight into a problem that has been gained after careful thought and consideration has come from their deity. This knowledge doesnât appear suddenly but is the reward for taking time and exploring all possibilities. The Oversee of War thinks highly of those who consider their options before acting decisively, as well as of those who follow through with long-term plans without faltering.</p>\n<p>Any sign of plans failing, the confusion reigning, or participants not understanding their role is seen as a sign that the Axiomatic General is displeased and expects greater discipline and forethought.</p>\n<h2>Servants</h2>\n<p>The Axiomatic General rewards those who organize well and keep to agreed plans, no matter how long this may take. These machinations often take many generations in the case of shorter-lived humanoids such as goblinoids and humans, or the entire life of the longest-living elves. Servants must be prepared to sacrifice the immediate for the longer term, understand that they may lose those around them today for the betterment of a lawful population tomorrow, and recognize that the needs of a lawful future outweigh any considerations here and now.</p>\n<p>The Overseer of War grants particular favour to those who constantly uphold the lawâinevitables are viewed with esteem alongside formians and other hive-minded creatures. Followers that devote themselves to a lifetime of achieving a long-term lawful aim regularly receive insight and clarity from their god. Humanoids that either spend a significant portion of their time gaining greater insight into a particular path or are able to rapidly judge the features and benefits of a number of possibilities before quickly making the correct decision often gain a divine hint or two.</p>\n<h2>The Church of the Axiomatic General</h2>\n<p>Sites of worship to the Lord of All Wars serve one purpose: to ensure that correct decision are made to further indisputable truth. They range in size from an officerâs table in their tent, a simple sand tablet on which a cleric explains a truth, or in a lawyerâs or sageâs rooms, to the chambers of a countryâs most magnificent courtroom, the order flags at the front line of the latest battle in a war, or the grandest library within the @UUID[JournalEntry.QVrlu0lTv2vFtT5P]{Klavek Kingdom} most spectacular cathedral to the Axiomatic General. Churches to this god are all simple, plain affairs that remove mental distraction and clutter at the same time as allowing axioms and tenets spoken by the Overseer of War to be spread effectively and efficiently.</p>\n<p>Worship of the Axiomatic General is frequently silent as followers consider practical issues at hand as well as long-term problems that require a more considered solution. Followers frequently engage in debates, most of which are serious but enjoyable affairsâthere is no time for frivolous thought when the Lord of All Warâs tenets are involvedâalthough there is no sense of âvictory or defeatâ in these sessions (the aim is to reach the truest, most accurate solution to a question, and everybody learns something.) When necessary, churches of the Overseer of War provide a neutral meeting point between warring factions of good and evil, although only the most experienced and senior of clergy attempt to mediate between chaotic elements. The Axiomatic General has shown that the wisest course for followers of law is to work together to overcome chaos through any means possible before resolving philosophical and personal lawful differences using contemplation and debate.</p>\n<p>The clergy of the Overseer of War organize themselves in a clear and obvious hierarchy in the same way that any modern military, business, or courtroom would do. Similarly, religious and educational centres that follow the Axiomatic General have a plain structure in place that shows who has best demonstrated an understanding of the godâs aims and objectives. No matter where or how the Lord of All War is followed, its churches are defined by their grasp of unequivocal truths, unimpeachable laws, unbeatable tactics, and unquestionable enlightenment. Churches that exhibit knowledge over belief and can demonstrate undeniable evidence for these truths have the greatest standing, no matter what their size. Worshipers rise up the ranks in the same way: anyone who can establish irrefutable knowledge and information is given ever greater responsibilities. At the same time, mistakes arenât considered a failure if the individuals concerned can show they did all they could to establish clarity and a considered answer. All they have to do is recognize that further investigation has produced better knowledge and make sure they donât repeat the mistake. As the Lord of All Wars is happy to develop plans over many generations, errors that can be rectified bear little consequence.</p>\n<p>Churches worshipping the Axiomatic General are openly found in the centre of lawful societies and on the outskirts of those populations with no preference for law or chaos but are seemingly absent from chaotic cultures. The Overseer of War prefers his followers to surround such cultures and gradually move inwards until the chaos is crushed out of themâa process that takes as long as is necessary, designed to ensure no worshiper is tricked into joining chaos from within.</p>\n<p>Services to the Axiomatic General are ordered affairs, comprising either contemplation of the truth or respectful presentation of findings and subsequent decision-making they influence. In all situations, there is ample opportunity for everyone who wants to speak to do so, although followers recognize the need to act swiftly during war situations and develop a truncated, precise style of presenting their findings.</p>\n<h2>Worshipers</h2>\n<p>The Axiomatic General is primarily worshipped by military officers but also draws in judges, lawyers, barristers, sages, monks, and those who would advance society in an ordered and structured way. Those who indulge in chaotic thoughts and acts are ignored at all times.</p>\n<h2>Clergy</h2>\n<p>The clergy of the Overseer of War are not necessarily clerics, although if they arenât they are only allowed to represent the god within their own sphere of expertise and influence (for example, military officers can only lead services and discussions about military matters). Any member of the clergy who is a cleric is required to lead a service in an overarching capacity even if the content is decided by the senior subject expert. In all situations, the most experience cleric leads a service, with assistance as appropriate from other members of the congregation.</p>\n<p>The Axiomatic General does not support paladins, despite their martial outlook. Their tendency towards good leads them to not always consider the balanced needs of a lawful life, which in turn means their judgment isnât always going to be the best it can be in some situations.</p>\n<h2>Temples and Shrines</h2>\n<p>Buildings devoted to the Lord of All Wars are functional, unadorned, designed to serve all aspects of the godâs tenets, yet clearly focused on one domain more than others (whatever that may be). It isnât unusual for there to be four temples next to each otherâone for each aspect of devotion with followers visiting whichever is most appropriate for their needs.</p>\n<p>All sites of worship have one item in common: a magical lead box with an amazing lock that holds a copy of the four holy texts of the Axiomatic General (The Four Planes of Certain Truth) plus one additional book of specific thoughts on the area of expertise of the congregation. These boxes are identical as adornment or elaboration is forbidden as an unnecessary distraction, and are always at the centre of any service of worship or decision-making process. Whenever the box is locked after its final use for the day, the text within each book is updated via divine intervention if a more accurate and truthful version of any piece of information has been discovered and when new facts have been uncovered.</p>\n<p>Each place of worship also contains the thought processes of anyone who has worked to uncover indisputable truths, as well as the evidence that demonstrates that truth. Whenever someone is uncovering a new truth, their work-in-progress materials are stored here as well.</p>\n<h2>Holy Texts</h2>\n<p>The Four Planes of Certain Truth contain the pertinent and unequivocal statements confirmed by the Axiomatic General. When stored in their magical box they are updated via divine intervention when it is locked at the end of the day. No decision is made without this box being present, even if it isnât used. Clerics of the Overseer of War receive notification of changes as part of their meditation; all clerics and service leaders are encouraged to learn the texts by heart (as interpretation isnât required).</p>\n<p>Each book bears a simple cover, binding, and little decoration other than an iron rod over a stylized letter that identifies its contents. Other documents stored at temples and shrines have these two symbols plus the initials of the author and the date of publication. When any document is superseded, the date of its relegation from cannon is stamped on the cover and the original symbols are scored through.</p>\n<p>Â </p>\n<h3><em><strong>Axioms of War</strong></em></h3>\n<p>This contains the latest approved plans for war as a whole, as well as tactics for individual fights. The core contentâwhen consulted prior to a battleâconfers both a confidence-boosting and calming effect as it confirms how its actions bring eventual victory in the war (with that dayâs battle an important part of it). Chapters detail the stages of engagement and explain the surest way forward at each point. They describe how a lawful plan can be overcome by the sheer weight of chaos, but also how to learn from that experience and counter it in the next battle.</p>\n<p>Â </p>\n<p>Â </p>\n<h3><em><strong>Axioms of Law</strong></em></h3>\n<p>This contains the latest approved plans for passing legal judgment as a whole, as well as tactics for individual cases. When consulted prior to establishing guilt or innocence, it confers both a clarity- and authority-boosting effect as it confirms how its actions ensure the correct judgment is reached. Chapters detail the stages of ascertaining the truth from all that has been presented as evidence as well as methods to consider it in an effective, efficient, and impartial manner. They also describe how well-made laws can be twisted and broken by the inherently devious, and how to rewrite those laws to ensure this doesnât happen in future.</p>\n<p>Â </p>\n<p>Â </p>\n<h3><em><strong>Axioms of Decisions</strong></em></h3>\n<p>This contains the latest methods and directions for effective and efficient meditation as well as long-established research techniques from the churchâs greatest sages and experts. When consulted before an investigation is started, it confers a mind-clearing and attention-focusing effect as it confirms how its actions allow a user to reveal the most pertinent and accurate information. Chapters detail how to consider what needs to be discovered, how to ensure what is found matches the initial requirements, and then how to use the information to make the correct decision. They also describe how distraction, obfuscation, and distortion of aims and objects (such as shortcuts) lead to an incorrect decision with long-term consequences.</p>\n<p>Â </p>\n<p>Â </p>\n<h3><em><strong>Axioms of Enlightenment</strong></em></h3>\n<p>This contains pathways to understanding the world at large and the part one plays in that world as well as how the best of life is achieved through the order. When consulted before meditating, it confers an open-mindedness that ensures the route to enlightenment is properly followed as it confirms how its actions allow a user to reach self-knowledge without deviation or distraction. Chapters give details on what to do before, during, and after meditation, as well as how to realize enlightenment has been reached. They also describe how our contemplation can be lessened by the actions of others, but how these digressions can be overcome and enlightenment eventually reached.</p>\n<h2>Holidays</h2>\n<p>The Axiomatic General is not celebrated at any specific festivals. Instead, when the law prevails during any of the godâs areas of interest, followers offer a prayer of thanks no more than 30 minutes after the event. If gratitude is shown later than this, it probably means the follower was distracted from the task at hand and has acted in a chaotic way to make the thanks fit in. Better to acknowledge the effect of the Overseer of War with oneâs body and mind than take yourself away from a pressing matter and make two situations chaotic.</p>\n<p>Â </p>\n<p>Â </p>\n<p>Â </p>\n<p>Â </p>\n<p>Â </p>\n</div>","markdown":""},"_id":"OB8fp8gIre5yoZax","image":{},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"sort":400000,"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"JournalEntry.0FSVjV3WkdoAk7OX.JournalEntryPage.K8IEnGHHZ3800Nio"}}},{"name":"Ancestor Spirit","type":"text","title":{"show":false,"level":1},"text":{"format":1,"content":"<div class=\"aventyr\">\n<p class=\"s5\">Ancestor Spirit</p>\n<img style=\"margin:0px 10px 10px 0px;border:0px;float:right\" src=\"modules/aaw-games-aventyr/Deities-Images/waterfall_edit-scaled.webp\" width=\"244\" height=\"698\" />\n<p><strong>Titles: </strong>Breath of Life, Life Spirit</p>\n<p><strong>Home: </strong>Positive energy plane</p>\n<p><strong>Alignment: </strong>NG</p>\n<p><strong>Portfolio: </strong>Ancestor, nature, wilderness, wisdom</p>\n<p><strong>Worshippers:</strong> @UUID[JournalEntry.QlctNkzE9injOde9.JournalEntryPage.I4CpK8rTs0HgD7hW]{Vikmordere}</p>\n<p><strong>Domains: </strong>Animal, Community, Plant</p>\n<p><strong>Subdomains: </strong>Ancestors, Seasons, Souls</p>\n<p><strong>Favored Weapon: </strong>Wooden staff</p>\n<p>The Ancestor Spirit venerates reconnection with nature, and exploration of oneâs inner being without the scourge of individual financial gain.</p>\n<p>Â  Â  The pure energy which forms this deity is comprised of the souls of the original ancient settlers of the @UUID[JournalEntry.QVrlu0lTv2vFtT5P]{Klavek Kingdom}/@UUID[JournalEntry.Cg0Nt8mDPQ7JrmyB]{Vikmordere}.

He was dissatisfied; dwarves had become a lesser race, overcome by the @UUID[JournalEntry.QlctNkzE9injOde9.JournalEntryPage.8HyVcZ70eyhwNJsu]{Drow}, among others. His life was punctuated by constant struggle and heroic feats that are the things of legend: he re-mastered the lost arts of metalworking once known by his ancestors; he defended his homeland single-handedly against creatures of the Underworld, and he built himself a flawless suit of unbreakable armour. Inside this shell, he was an unstoppable force, and Balir took back thousands of miles of once-dwarven lands. He rose higher than any before making the fatal flaw of offering his hand in peace to the drow.</p>\n<p>The story goes that the Drow cast a curse of burning into his unbreakable armour, sealing the dwarf inside and setting it ablaze forever. But at this moment the gods saw Balir as the greatest martyr of his people and granted him a spark of divinity; he awoke as a god, still within the armour that had become his tomb, and departed the mortal realm.</p>\n<p>Having risen from the ranks of mortals, Balir has been forced to prove himself to the gods over and over again, showing them he is worthy. His feats as a god are no less than his feats as a mortal, although they take place in realms far beyond manâs comprehension. It is from one of these divine toils that he claimed his mighty hammer, Soul Forger â a weapon clearly claimed from a creature many times larger than Balir himself.</p>\n<p>Even as he found himself a god, Balir kept his destroyed mortal form as a sign of his penance. Instead of divine flesh, he constructed a metal body for himself to replace the one he lost. This new skin is without the flaw of mercy that destroyed him as a mortal. And although Balirâs scarred face is unmistakably dwarven, his body is anything but. A cast of white mithral and black iron, he appears more machine than man. Now, even with his drow-cursed armour destroyed, he still blazes with the murderous fire; in his chest, he carries a spark from which the sun was born. When he does not appear in his divine form, Balir assumes the guise of a young dwarf, typically bearing scars on his face and arms from flame.</p>\n<h2>Churches, Clergy, and Worshippers</h2>\n<p>Churches to Balir are at once humble and magnificent. Their areas of worship are simple and unadorned, although always practical, in a manner befitting dwarven life itself. Whether the smallest shrine or grandest cathedral, sites dedicated to Balir always stand near a place of work, toil, and creation. In them, they are guided by Balirâs ancient knowledge and secrets to produce machines, mechanical goods, and works of active art unlike anywhere else in the world. Balirâs clergy are predominantly dwarven, although some humans do acclaim his faith as well. Where they can, they dress in mithral and crimson â styling themselves after their god. Poorer members of the faith dress instead in white and yellow. Worshippers almost always offer constructed items as their offering. If they do resort to just money, itâs always directed toward a newly-qualified crafter or a promising apprentice.</p>\n<h2>Holy Text</h2>\n<p>The Life of Balir is unlike any standard book of holy teachings. Instead, this tome is almost three thousand pages long and details the thousand trials and tribulations of Balirâs life, written in such a way that it is more like a dwarven self-help book than divine instruction. Some versions have additional volumes discussing the merits of each action Balir took, although these are known to be opinions, not facts. The original text is unchanged from when it was penned by Balirâs own son, after the dwarfâs ascension to godhood.</p>\n</div>","markdown":""},"_id":"SjKuUjzrx9TNLn0y","image":{},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"sort":500000,"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"JournalEntry.EykWA9hRZOjLFz6G.JournalEntryPage.JtgEqWY5XOkGnzgZ"}}},{"name":"The Current","type":"text","title":{"show":false,"level":1},"text":{"format":1,"content":"<div class=\"aventyr\">\n<p class=\"s5\">The Current</p>\n<img style=\"float:right;margin:0px 10px 10px 0px;border:0px\" src=\"modules/aaw-games-aventyr/Deities-Images/The-Current.webp\" width=\"267\" height=\"316\" />\n<p><strong>Alignment:</strong> LN</p>\n<p><strong>Portfolio:</strong> Insanity, Mysticism, Seas, Underworld Waters, the Unknown</p>\n<p><strong>Domains:</strong> Madness (Nightmare), Magic (Arcane), Void (Dark Tapestry), Water (Oceans)</p>\n<p><strong>Favoured Weapon:</strong> Tentacle (whips, spiked chains)</p>\n<p><strong>Favored Animals:</strong> Octopus, Squid</p>\n<p>Â </p>\n<h2>History</h2>\n<p>The other deities of Aventyr are forever vigilant for even the slightest brush of the Currentâs tentacles in their plans or near their essence, keeping a respectful distance from the maddening god. Its motives are totally unpredictable, though it strikes swiftly and without warning when it is suited to do so. The affairs of the gods donât seem to bear any interest to the Current, however, and it is thought to be slumbering, like the massive beasts that lay in the ruins of the vestraadiâs ancient civilizations. Indeed, some believe that these enormous predators are somehow related to the maddening god and not without good reason; they appeared not long after the Current came to Aventyr.</p>\n<h2>Appearance</h2>\n<p>Records of The Currentâs appearance are extremely vague by necessity; those that look upon it are driven utterly mad. The few reliable accounts claim that it is floating, slithering or pulsating mass of writhing tentacles, the end of each covered in barbs of colours for which there is no shade or name.</p>\n<h2>Churches of the Maddening God</h2>\n<p>These revered houses of worship completely encompass those within them, covered in sculptures of tentacles that extend throughout the structure. The holiest of these churches are actually made from the recovered limbs of enormous squids and octopusesâthe architecture within them drives any non-followers of the Current to madness, afflicting any creature within with a form of insanity should they fail a DC 16 Wisdom saving throw.</p>\n<h2>Holy Text</h2>\n<p>No books exist for the religion of the maddening god; instead, the vestraadi keep song strings. When wound or unwound underwater, these magical cords play hymns of the Currentâs religion (in a tongue those that hear them can understand). The holiest and most valuable of these song strings are said to relate the true origins of the aquatic deity but are said to drive those that hear them mad with the voice of the Current, cursed to forever live with its echo in their mind.</p>\n<h2>Vast Swamp</h2>\n<p>@UUID[JournalEntry.g4odaMsHbRkeNFhn.JournalEntryPage.oIbJsrbNZu7GVWp9#the-muddy-mangroves]{The Muddy Mangroves} has always been the center of the Currentâs clergy in the Vast Swamp.

The others chose their domains carefully, but Eureum took his from necessity. For, there must be balance in life as there must be balance in death. He feels it is his job to keep the other seasons in check, and it was he who proposed dividing the world into the four seasons we know it as today.</p>\n<h2>Appearance</h2>\n<p>Eureum often appears as a faceless figure, male or female, draped in a robe made of dried leaves and carrying a scythe in one skeletal hand, and a shovel in the other. It is said, that beneath the cowl, he perpetually weeps.</p>\n<p>Â  Â When he does not appear in a humanoid form, he appears as a collection of dry autumn leaves blowing in the wind.</p>\n<h2>Church of Eureum</h2>\n<p>Much to his dismay, most of Eureumâs churches are misguided, focusing only on one aspect â either death or rebirth â and are often fanatical in their beliefs. He considers only a few shrines to him, often deep within forests and away from civilization, to be true churches.</p>\n<h2>Worshippers and Clergy</h2>\n<p>Eureumâs followers are more often fanatics than they are proper clergy, focusing either on bringing either death or life wherever they go instead of maintaining the cycle of life and death.</p>\n<p>Â His true followers dress in dirty brown robes, often matted with dried leaves and crawling with tiny insects.</p>\n<h2>Holy Text</h2>\n<p>On Death: This book details the cycle of death, and life, and how all life depends on death for sustenance as much as death depends on life â for one is impossible without the other.

Her mother, Laelstra, was the Matronâs personal seeress. Hivaka possessed only the slightest of her motherâs magical abilities, mastering cantrips at an early age, but progressing no further. Being the youngest daughter, barely older than her only brother, and her sisters already being groomed for succession to various positions within the House, Hivaka found herself being used as leverage but almost everyone around her.</p>\n<p>Â  Â  Hivakaâs father, Elkerd, was first son of House Kilduis, allies of House Ruim. Among Elkerdâs vices was gamblingâhe never minded losing, as long as fun was had by all. The problems began when he started using House Kildiusâ assets to cover his wagers. When he was financially cut off from House Kilduis, he took the step of offering his youngest daughter, Hivaka, to the winner of a game of orbben. When Elkerd lost to Imfein of House Rilyntyl, a rival of House Kilduis, Hivaka was taken from her home by force. Laelstra protested, but there were too many reliable witnesses to the wager for her challenges to hold sway over her Matron. Thus, Hivaka was taken into slavery by House Rilyntyl. Laelstra attempted to buy Hivaka from Imfein, but was rebuffed, as having a bargaining chip against House Kilduisâ ally was worth much more than gold.</p>\n<p>Â  Â  Â Aside from the hard labour she and many others were forced to endure, Hivaka was treated wellâas well as a slave could be treated, anyway. She took her enforced servitude in stride, seeing as how she had almost never held any power of significance in her life. However, she harboured a hatred for her father, not understanding how a parent could blithely hand over their childâs life to another simply to cover a bet.</p>\n<p>Â  Â  Â The guards from House Imfein did not treat her any better or any worse than any of the other slaves. Neither did they prohibit her mother from visiting her occasionally during the evening, as long as no escape attempts were made. They did, however, restrain her from braining her father with her work hammer the one and only time he approached her during a shift of breaking up rocks. If not for the guards, Elkerd would have died violently, but possibly not quickly.</p>\n<p>Â  Â  Â Hivaka was a slave of House Imfein for almost a full year before Laelstra recruited a large following and put a plan into action that would free Hivak: she and her cohort would attack the Imfein guards at the slave pens during the night and Hivak would escape in the confusion while wearing the battle-dress of a House Imfein sorceress.</p>\n<p>Â  Â  Â  The assault appeared to be a success as chaos reigned in the slave pens, however, Laelstra had not anticipated two things: first, there were more guards than anticipated, causing longer holdups and more casualties as the attacking mob progressed. More guards also meant that an alarm could be sounded, bringing reinforcements, which compounded the existing issues with the rescue.</p>\n<p>Â  Â  The second issue was that Hivaka had determined that no matter where she was in drow society, she would be enslaved. Either to another house or within her own, where she would be used as a pawn in countless numbers of schemes by her Matron and her own family. As the youngest daughter, she held the lowest standing. Because of this, she was determined not to return to her home.</p>\n<p>Â  Â  Once in possession of the Imfein battle dress, Hivaka pulled the attached hood over her head and began leading slaves away, using her implied authority, along with some well-placed and spectacular-looking cantrips, to move them without interference. She had nearly one hundred slaves with her when they left the Xdot border.</p>\n<p>Â  Â Leading them on through the night, Hivaka found a narrow cave entrance that led into a larger cavern inside. Using the last of her available magicks, Hivaka attempted to cover the mouth of the cave with an illusion showing solid rock. The image was far more effective than Hivak knew because she and her group had attracted the attention of @UUID[.2MMXPI4kINBOYNOP]{Leacim}, the only known male drow deity.</p>\n<p>Â  Â  Â A trickster among the more serious drow goddesses, @UUID[.2MMXPI4kINBOYNOP]{Leacim} took this opportunity to thumb his nose at his sisters and to have fun, watching as the drow patrols searched the area over and over, never seeing past his illusions.</p>\n<p>Â  Â  Â The rescued slaves began worshipping Hivaka as a saviour. She resisted their praise, saying that she was simply another slave, like them. Leacimâknowing that these slaves needed someone to look up to, invested a small amount of his power in Hivaka, raising her above the mortals, but not so high as the divine: he made her a demigoddess.</p>\n<p>Â  Â  Â Those under her protection turned their new home into a town, called Nhlilolin, which has become a haven for the outcasts of the Underworld.</p>\n<h2>Appearance</h2>\n<p>Hivaka is short, for a drow, but heavily muscled from her time as a slave. Her light grey hair is kept short for a drow female, the ends reaching her jawline. Her eyes are blue, relatively rare in the Underworld, and if you look into them, you will find nothing but steely resolve.</p>\n<p>Â  Â Hivaka keeps her clothes simple, preferring pants and shirts that have pockets. The more pockets, the better. She is never anywhere without the hammer that she used to break the chains of the other slaves before leading them off into the night. Every morning or after any combat, she repairs the wooden handle with the mending cantrip.</p>\n<h2>Church of Hivaka</h2>\n<p>Hivaka, as a very recent demigoddess, does not have a church, but those that were rescued from imprisonment literally sing her praises every day. She downplays her role as a saviour or someone to be worshipped. She does have her devoted followers and, thanks to @UUID[.2MMXPI4kINBOYNOP]{Leacim}, she is able to grant them a small number of spells. She has not gained any paladins, though.</p>\n<h2>Worshippers and Clergy</h2>\n<p>Those who escaped with Hivaka are her greatest worshippers, but any who have escaped bondage freely speak her name with reverence. There is no set clergy in Nhilolin, but some apostles go out into the Underworld (and a few to the Upperworld) and speak against slavery, striving to free those that are held down, if only through word if not deed.</p>\n<p>Â  Â  Â Some of these preachers will gather the like-minded with them and attempt to free those taken by slavers. These zealots do not care if they live or die, as long as those imprisoned go free.</p>\n<h2>Holy Text</h2>\n<p>The Journey: The only text that Hivaka doesnât simply shake her head at is The Journey. This collection of parchments is the story of not only Hivaka leading the slaves of House Imfein to freedom, but every person who has escaped from an overlord is welcome to add their story to The Journey. So far, almost three hundred stories have been put into the collection.</p>\n<p>Â </p>\n<p>A second âholy textâ has begun circulating throughout Nhilolin and the Underworld, speaking of Hivaka in the holiest of languages, greatly exaggerating her abilities, and almost, but not quite, painting her as the goddess who will eventually overthrow the mightiest of slavers, Naraneus herself. Hivaka has tried to explain that the book, The Light of Hivaka and the Way Forward, brings attention to her and the town, which is mentioned by name in the book, and could lead to them all being recaptured. This explanation has failed, so far.</p>\n<p>Â </p>\n</div>","markdown":""},"_id":"fGrUoxdeUcElXl1w","image":{},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"sort":1000000,"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"JournalEntry.0ZJ73TBS2gtaaHzz.JournalEntryPage.8ICOLekqb9Rv4c6W"}}},{"name":"Ja Qua","type":"text","title":{"show":true,"level":1},"text":{"format":1,"content":"<div class=\"aventyr\">\n<p class=\"s5\">Ja Qua</p>\n<img style=\"float:right;margin:0px 10px 10px 0px;border:0px\" src=\"modules/aaw-games-aventyr/Deities-Images/Ja-Qua.webp\" width=\"263\" height=\"235\" />\n<p><strong>Titles: </strong>Mother, Jaguar Queen, Heart of the Jungle, She Behind the Leaves</p>\n<p><strong>Home: </strong>The Fey Jungle</p>\n<p><strong>Alignment </strong>LN</p>\n<p><strong>Portfolio: </strong>Strength, The Hunt, Family</p>\n<p><strong>Worshippers:</strong> Actively worshipped by many natives of @UUID[JournalEntry.RMK7HBFDlPXDiURg]{NairaCull}</p>\n<p><strong>Domains: </strong>Strength, Animal, Law, Protection</p>\n<p><strong>Subdomains: </strong>Ferocity, Fur, Resolve</p>\n<p><strong>Favoured</strong> <strong>Weapon:</strong> Natural Claws, Maquahuitl</p>\n<p>Considered by a vast majority of the native peoples of NairaCull to be she who controls the balance of life within their lands, the worship of Ja Qua is the dominant faith within the dark nation.</p>\n<p>Â </p>\n<p>Â </p>\n<h2>History</h2>\n<p>Ja Qua herself predates most written language, and her own followers have spent their entire lives passing down the tales told to them from previous generations, leaving her history entirely in the hands of those who revere her. Little is known to her followers of her true origins, only that she has proven to be an active and loyal spiritual force within the lives of those who never looked away from the older forms of worship.</p>\n<p>Â  Â Ja Qua exists within a sub-dimension connected to the mainlands of the Seelie Court and has fostered a deep relationship with the fey of her lands, looking upon them with the same love and care as her human followers. In turn, the fey has come to view her as one of their own and a revered person of power amongst their courts, and will not hesitate to interact on her behalf within her lands.</p>\n<h2>Appearance</h2>\n<p>Ja Qua appears in one of two forms when she chooses to appear at all. The first is that of a monstrously large and physically powerful jaguar, golden tawny in colour with spots that appear to shift and move before oneâs eyes. Crowned with a rim of bony protrusions across her brow and snout, there is no mistaking Ja Qua in her feline form as the self-appointed Queen of her lands. Her second form is one of far more subtlety, one of an attractive woman, typically still keeping the tawny colour of her pelt within her long hair. The colour of her eyes in human form is said to be indescribable, as no true colour exists within nature to compare them to, and her voice will both seduce and petrify you with fear in the same instant.</p>\n<h2>Church of Ja Qua</h2>\n<p>Ja Quaâs worship is strongest within the lands of @UUID[JournalEntry.RMK7HBFDlPXDiURg]{NaeraCull}, though there is the random shrine amongst a few forgotten uncivilized locations, where the march of progress has not severed all of humanity's connection to the Seelie Court yet.</p>\n<h2>Worshippers and Clergy</h2>\n<p>Those tribal warriors deemed worthy are put through a ritualistic challenge to earn Ja Quaâs Blessing, the gift of lycanthropy. Those who survive the process of transformation, and are not driven mad by the ritualistic pain they must go through to prove their worth find themselves in a position of honour amongst the tribes and temples, utilized as guardians and hunters, protecting both the faith and an ancient way of life. Dressed in only a loincloth these warriors tend to embrace the custom of adorning themselves with colourful trinkets and baubles to mark victories over adversaries, or glorious hunts.</p>\n<p>Â  Â Â Those of great enough faith, but not physical stamina to serve the tribes as warriors tend the temples and altars of Ja Qua as her loyal clerics. Over time those of the deepest devotion begin to acquire certain feline traits, though they never achieve the full embrace of Ja Qua as the temple warriors do.</p>\n<h2>Holy Text</h2>\n<p>Scattered throughout the jungle are many lost ruins of forgotten tribes, within which are wall carvings and bas-reliefs depicting the teachings of various points in the history of the church of Ja Qua. Most of the written language of the people of NairaCull is pictographic and has never been compiled into text or bound format, although it is rumoured that a man travels the jungle seeking to do just that.</p>\n<h2>The Dralman Documents</h2>\n<p>A skald of some renown, Theo Dralman was quested by the Grand University of @UUID[JournalEntry.QVrlu0lTv2vFtT5P.JournalEntryPage.dwAJ5Jtc6ii8zQoh]{Mohkba} to enter the dark jungle and learn all he could of the spirits to which the native people prayed, and how the @UUID[JournalEntry.QVrlu0lTv2vFtT5P]{Klavek Kingdom} could use this information to its own end. That was many years ago, and many of the legends spoken amongst the tribes that have encountered Dralman would lead one to believe that his goals have changed, and his search for knowledge has become something far more personal. Most of the legends speak of a man carrying a great many scars, as if he had been mauled to the edge of death, only to be spared and shown a new path. There exist a few rare copies of his incomplete work, taken to the coastal towns by couriers and those on safariâ¦the Dralman Documents they have become known as. All public possession of these documents within the borders of Klavekian-controlled lands is considered treasonous and punishable by seizure of properties and goods, as well as incarceration.</p>\n<p>Â </p>\n</div>","markdown":""},"_id":"21VmQoL4MPe6mX6q","image":{},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"sort":1100000,"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"JournalEntry.LQT16PQtjrxETCAe.JournalEntryPage.3JNs1m50QSpNDrdf"}}},{"name":"Leacim","type":"text","title":{"show":false,"level":1},"text":{"format":1,"content":"<div class=\"aventyr\">\n<p class=\"s5\">Leacim</p>\n<img style=\"float:right;margin:0px 10px 10px 0px;border:0px\" src=\"modules/aaw-games-aventyr/Deities-Images/Leacim.webp\" width=\"262\" height=\"371\" />\n<p><strong>Titles: </strong>The Clever Shadow</p>\n<p><strong>Symbol: </strong>Spinning 8-faceted gem</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary)\"><strong style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">Alignment: </strong>CN</span></p>\n<p><strong>Portfolio: </strong>Chance, Guile, Illusion, Misfortune, Self-Determination, Thieves</p>\n<p><strong>Domains: </strong>Chaos, Entropy, Deception, Luck, Trickery</p>\n<p><strong>Favoured</strong> <strong>Weapon:</strong> Scimitar, Shortbow, Throwing Knife</p>\n<p><strong>Favoured Animals:</strong> Any beast with camouflage or mimicry (such as a chameleon, stick bug, etc)</p>\n<p>Â </p>\n<h2>History</h2>\n<p>The Aventyr god known as Leacim was once a forgotten deity, supplanted by the doings of the colloid aeons before it ever reached the Underworld. Once a treasured god of cunning and wisdom, he was left bereft in the void of the cosmosâwhen Leacim stared into the void, something from the far beyond stared back. Now slightly deranged and without an identity, the god capered throughout the universe with a will and desire at the whim of his growing insanity.</p>\n<p>Â  Â Eventually, the divine energies wrought on Aventyr during the Forging of the Dvergr caught Leacimâs attention, drawing him to the periphery of the world to witness the rise of the progenitors and their fall into the draaki. It was the elven deities, however, that most interested the god of misfortuneâover hundreds of years, he subtly infiltrated their pantheon and species, attributing fanatical devotees in the very flesh before spreading them across both Upper- and Underworld. He appeared inexplicably among the elven pantheon, fully adopting the drow form and gathering followers both before and after their exodus from Edhellond.</p>\n<p>Â  Â  Â The most famous of these followers is @UUID[.fGrUoxdeUcElXl1w]{Hivaka} , the Savior of the Masses. Leacim took notice when she and her fellow slaves took flight from Xdot. He imparted the aspiring dark elf with some of his divine essences, forever transforming her into a demigoddess.</p>\n<p>Â  Â Leacim continues to take an active (albeit underhanded) role in the continued existence of the drow. He travels through the Underworld, briefly touching the souls of dark elves and morphing their alignments towards chaos, neutrality or even goodness if it suits his mood. The lone raider Dâthul, a cannibalistic sorcerer-barbarian in the Fungi Forest near Holoth, is one such drow. Those on the surface often see their lives subtly influenced by the trickster god, and Leacim leads them to roles of dubious natures and unexpected rewards.</p>\n<h2>Special</h2>\n<p>Leacim takes delight in angering the other @UUID[JournalEntry.QlctNkzE9injOde9.JournalEntryPage.8HyVcZ70eyhwNJsu]{Drow} gods at every opportunity; his followers may substitute Leacim as the required diety for any item, class, feat or spell that has a drow deity requirement and may select the Drow domain if they have access to domains. Moreover, he often creates his own agents of changeâplayers that wish to play a drow of good alignment in a place that would otherwise prohibit that choice may choose Leacim as their deity to avoid that caveat.</p>\n<h2>Appearance</h2>\n<p>The trickster god has numerous guises but he most commonly appears as an affably dressed male half-drow with an alluring grin or a blonde human girl, regardless of form, both have piercing blue eyes. Leacimâs clothing is generally fashionable and appropriate for the environment, though it is sometimes slightly tattered and seemingly in a state of disrepair. He casually saunters seemingly without a care in the world, a scimitar on his side and a black-lacquered short bow across his back, in the female form he carries only a single knife as a weapon which always returns to him when thrown.</p>\n<h2>Shrines to the Trickster</h2>\n<p>Leacim doesnât have proper churchesâeffigies and the like are hidden in plain sight or are places of secret pilgrimage. These shrines are often made to look like they belong to other deities, and only show their true forms when the correct prayers are uttered. Followers that fail a DC 28 Knowledge (religion) check find their god distempered with them after praying at one of these shrines, though they remain unsure as to why (regardless of any divination spells they cast).</p>\n<h2>Holy Text</h2>\n<p>Leacimâs Lexicon is a treasured tome among thievesâ guilds, hidden drow enclaves and the trickster godâs followers. These books appear as unremarkable journals of unremarkable lives to followers of other deities (DC 26 Wisdom saving throw to negate) but in the hands of a devoted acolyte, provide a means to learn any rogue trick, illusion spell, or access to knowledge of prestige classes that require sneak attack as a prerequisite.</p>\n<h2>The Vast Swamp</h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:Signika, sans-serif\">Leahcim has taken root in the @UUID[JournalEntry.g4odaMsHbRkeNFhn]{Vast Swamp}, his trickster ways helping some daredevil rogues on their quest to lessen the burden of treasure on the vile dragons. It must be added that the tales of the rogues have become known but so far none have surfaced to verify these claims. Recently some inhabitants in the marshes have voiced their concernsâthat these rumors are merely planted by Leahcim himself for some unknown reasonâbut the trickster god has plans and schemes no mere mortal can hope to discern.</span></p>\n</div>","markdown":""},"_id":"2MMXPI4kINBOYNOP","image":{},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"sort":1200000,"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"JournalEntry.fAaBvRaalStVHLAa.JournalEntryPage.CYEQQN8Bs7oSr3YE"}}},{"name":"MustaâVohi","type":"text","title":{"show":false,"level":1},"text":{"format":1,"content":"<div class=\"aventyr\"><p class=\"s5\">MustaâVohi</p><p><strong>Titles: </strong>God Mother, Heavenly Concubine</p><p><strong>Homel: </strong>Everywhere</p><p><strong>Symbol: </strong>A goatâs head painted black</p><p><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary)\"><strong style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">Alignment: </strong>NE</span></p><p><strong>Portfolio: </strong>Birth, Health, Motherhood, Lust, Pregnancy</p><p><strong>Domains: </strong>Charm, Darkness, Healing, Protection</p><p><strong>Favoured</strong> <strong>Weapon:</strong> Spiked chain</p><p>Â </p><h2>History</h2><p>According to the @UUID[JournalEntry.dHHrcptCELfN05gb.JournalEntryPage.Tc1kTiX3bvQt4Jd7]{Yerek}, MustaâVohi created the universe from the sheer will to reproduce.

This light both warmed the cosmos and struck out against the darkness that also appeared. This light, both protective and aggressive is embodied in Naneth. She is both Leaf Mother and Warrior Mother.</p>\n<p>Â  Â Naneth (NAH neth), her sister @UUID[.leuKpASroHy7r6sn]{Naraneus}, and their brother @UUID[.zNH5DtHDKD52Ufaf]{Onael} created the first elves. Naneth comforted and warmed the elves, but she also taught them to defend themselves. She showed them to care for each other and themselves, but they only had each other to rely on. As the elves evolved, she became more of a mothering figure to them, offsetting the chaotic presence of Naraneus, while Onael drifted away from the family.</p>\n<p>Â  Â  Eventually, Naraneus became jealous of Nanethâs mothering ways and began a feud between the two that would last for ages and eventually encompass the elves as well, two groups choosing a deity to follow. Naraneus lost and the elves that followed her were banished from Edhellond.</p>\n<p>Â  Â  Once the war was over, Naneth reflected on Naraneusâs deceit. She decided that if she could not trust her own sister, her children couldnât trust anyone else. She instructed the Matriarch to retreat completely within @UUID[JournalEntry.wVQiwLZtRuaqbpFA]{Edhellond, the Silent Forest}.</p>\n<p>Â  Â  Trade relations with the other races suddenly ceased and there was no response from envoys sent to the elves. The entire elven society retreated into Edhellond, turning entirely to hunting, agriculture, and magic; forsaking any trade or relations with other races.</p>\n<p>Â  Â Naneth taught the elves that they were to rely only on themselves for everything. There would be no trade, no exchanges of information, no envoys allowed inside Edhellond and only those on secret missions benefiting elvish society were allowed to venture out from Edhellond.</p>\n<h2>Appearance</h2>\n<p>Naneth appears in two forms, befitting her dual nature. In her Asaya Naneth (Leaf Mother) form, she appears as a motherly female Elf, with long golden hair that reaches the ground and she always carries a basket of bright blue flowers. In her Maethor Naneth (Warrior Mother) guise, she appears as a tall, stout elf, dressed in leather armour and a small cap keeping her jet black hair out of the way. Regardless of how she dresses, she has a pin of her symbol at the neck of her garment. She always carries a shield that is designed to look like her symbol.</p>\n<p>Â  Â  She can change between the two forms in the blink of an eye.</p>\n<h2>Church of Naneth</h2>\n<p>Nanethâs âchurchâ is more of an outdoor shrine at the largest maple tree in the Silent Forest, Tal. Edhellond is a theocracy, led by the current Matriarch or Patriarch, who also leads the services to Naneth.</p>\n<h2>Worshippers and Clergy</h2>\n<p>All surface elves worship Naneth in either of her two forms and worship of both is the norm. Clergy outside of the Matriarch/Patriarch and the Cleric of Naneth selected by the ruler are treated equally regardless of power level or ability. The motto of the clergy is âWe only have ourselvesâ so they do not discriminate in any way.</p>\n<h2>Holy Text</h2>\n<p>The Triploid Text: This tome is separated into sections of three, with each section beginning with a parable of Asaya Naneth, ending with a parable of Maethon Naneth, and the middle section being descriptions of the war between the elves and between Naneth and @UUID[.leuKpASroHy7r6sn]{Naraneus}.</p>\n<p>The cover of the copy that belongs to the Matriarch or Patriarch is created from several massive maple leaves.

Others claim it is the essence of the Honningsop Mushroom, the oldest living thing on the planet, elevated to godhood from the residual divine energies wrought throughout history. Its awakening may not have been caused by the pantheonâs doings, but its emergence seems to coincide with The Grand Sculpting and the Great Schism.</p>\n<p>As the endless caves of the Underworld expanded, vast chambers filled with moisture risen from tunnels hundreds of miles away, creating damp caverns of moist earth. The Natural Force seeded the subterranean breezes with its spores, creating the mushroom jungles and fungal forests of Aventyr. More than that, some of these spores carried the very children of the deityâintelligent, benevolent plant humanoids known as @UUID[JournalEntry.QlctNkzE9injOde9.JournalEntryPage.yv3q3b1HnUnZB2OT]{Funglet}.</p>\n<p>The divine beings of Aventyr generally regard the great nature deity of the Underworld with a measure of respect, if they acknowledge it at all. It answers the calls of its followers but is remarkably slow to act openly, playing the great game of the gods with a level of detachment and planning that no other deity can fathom.</p>\n<h2>Appearance</h2>\n<p>When the Natural Force does appear (which is extremely rare), it does so as a @UUID[JournalEntry.QlctNkzE9injOde9.JournalEntryPage.yv3q3b1HnUnZB2OT]{Funglet} of enormous height, colored in a kaleidoscopic mixture of all the different subtypes and carrying a gigantic club made from a fantafungi. Every patch of earth the Natural Force touches erupts with a random assortment of mushrooms immediately after he breaks contact with it, and all naturally grown barriers part their way for it and take no damage from its passing.</p>\n<h2>Church of the Natural Force</h2>\n<p>Any monument or sculpture of a mushroom serves as a shrine to the Natural Force, though acolytes of the nature deity pray to fungus of large size or greater if they are able to. Sites of particular religious significance always bear an importance to the number three, though none are sure why (save the Natural Force and its wisest adherents, though they have never revealed it).</p>\n<h2>Holy Text</h2>\n<p>The Libre Boletus is a tome crafted from boletann pages. Anyone that casually skims the book sees nothing but simple gardening tips to encourage the growth of mushrooms, but should they read it fully through, the pages transform to explain the tenets of the Natural Forceâs faith.

Together, they created the beings that would become knows at elves. @UUID[.oyFVdicDq8mbjOWw]{Naneth} provided the loving and mothering aspect. She showed them how to care for and protect each other, teaching them skills they needed to survive. @UUID[.leuKpASroHy7r6sn]{Naraneus} provided the chaos that seemed to pervade this new world and taught the elves about death and destruction and how to kill for food. Onael provided the controlling aspect, teaching the elves that in order to succeed, in spite of the chaos, there needed to be order and control. He taught them leadership and command and that of all the newly formed races, the elves were the greatest of them all.</p><p>Â  Â  Eventually, over the millennia, the elves evolved away from the controlled savagery and into the form that is more common today. As the world became more ordered, they needed their aggression less and opened themselves up more to the life and magic that surrounded them. Without as much violence, they began to live longer and grew smaller, as their muscles were not needed as much for combat. They understood that they did not need to conquer and control to live in the modern world and accepted their place, arriving in @UUID[JournalEntry.wVQiwLZtRuaqbpFA]{Edhellond}, the Elven land that would become known as the Silent Forest.</p><p>Â  Â Onael did not understand. He thought he had taught them correctly. Seeing that the elves had turned their back on him, he took what he considered his âchildren,â the Edheliast, and retreated from the world to the Forgotten Forest, a demiplane that he considered his home.</p><p>Â  Â  In the Forgotten Forest, the Edheliast continue to fight for survival, growing bigger, stronger, faster, and more cunning. They fight against animals, magical beasts, and even the souls of dead elves and drow that Onael claims before @UUID[.oyFVdicDq8mbjOWw]{Naneth} or @UUID[.leuKpASroHy7r6sn]{Naraneus} can.</p><p>Â  Â  Recently, Onael has begun work to reclaim the elves as his own. He has many Edheliast to fight for him and he has created a new beast that will surely be a surprise to the elves.</p><h2>Appearance</h2><p>Onael appears as an Elf of immense size. He stands close to fifteen feet tall and is very heavily muscled. His dark hair is close cropped and shows off a widowâs peak. He is dressed conservatively, wearing only a black tunic with his symbol on the left breast, black pants, and black boots. On his left hip rest his longsword Coiasan.</p><p>Â Images of @UUID[.oyFVdicDq8mbjOWw]{Naneth}, @UUID[.leuKpASroHy7r6sn]{Naraneus}, and Onael show that there is a sibling similarity between the three, but Onael claims that he has no sisters.</p><h2>Church</h2><p>There is no church of Onael. There are no services or high priests, only combat. The Edheliant serve Onael by fighting and honing their skills.</p><h2>Worshippers and Clergy</h2><p>Every Edheliant worships Onael in trials by combat. The Edheliant dedicate every battle they participate in to Onaelâs glory and ask for him to fill their bodies with power to crush their enemies.</p><p>Â  Â There is no church hierarchy. Those that Onael graces with the merest fraction of his power use the spells granted to them to enhance the combat abilities of their comrades and themselves. Onaelâs clerics call themselves âSword Armsâ and mostly use spells that increase Strength or Constitution but will also make liberal use of Cure spells and Channeling Energy (if Neutral) to make sure they and their comrades can continue fighting.</p><h2>Holy Text</h2><p>None, although any manual that teaches someone a new fighting technique or improves on an existing technique are considered sacred and are kept in a âlibraryâ in the middle of the Forgotten Forest.</p><p>Â This library is really just many piles of books collected from different planes and realms and every book in the collection deals with some sort of combat.

In the time after the Sun Lord brought the warming of the land, Storjeger led numerous hunts into the forest where they killed many animals. In the bounty that was the land warming, they hadnât realized that they had over-hunted, leaving the land unbalanced. This led to a lack of game when the land began to cool after the Sun Lordâs death.</p><p>Â  Â  Â  As the tribe began to dwindle due to lack of food in the harsh winter, Storjeger, as thin as the rest of the tribe, went into the forest alone to find what food he could. After several hours, he spotted a large stag with an impressive rack of horns. Sneaking as close as he dared, his hands trembling from hunger, he threw his javelin. It missed badly, but instead of rushing into the woods, the deer turned and looked at Storjeger.</p><p>Â  Â  The stag turned and walked slowly into the woods with Storjeger close behind. Following the deer for another hour, Storjeger had been led him to a place in the woods he had never been before. In the distance, he saw a herd of deer that numbered in the dozens with many calves. He prepared his javelin, but the deer he had followed looked at him and then knelt down, laying down its head. It was joined by three does, each kneeling down and offering their necks to Storjeger.</p><p>Â  Â  Storjeger drew his knife and offering thanks to the deer for their sacrifice, killed the four. He took a few small pieces of meat for himself to sustain him for the trip back. He produced a large sack and bundled the three deer into it and tied the bag to his belt. The stag, he hefted onto his shoulders as a sign of respect.</p><p>Â  Â  Â He made the walk back to the Skykosh tribe with tears in his eyes as he knew he could provide for his people. On the trip back, Storjeger realized that his people had to live in balance with the animals of the forest in order to make sure this didnât happen again. As it was partly his fault that the tribe was in such a predicament, Storjeger was determined to protect the balance of the forest.</p><p>Â  Â  Â Upon returning to his tribe, he delivered the deer and explained what had happened and what he had seen and the understanding of the balance. He took the head of the stag and created a mask from it and made a coat from the skin. Without another word, Storjeger walked out of the village and into the realm of the gods, making the name Storjeger synonymous with survival and donning the mantle of God of the Hunt.</p><p>Â  Â  Storjeger (STOR jay ger) almost always appears as a giant elk but sometimes manifests as a thin warrior of medium height with a stagâs head and horns. He carries several javelin on his back, a longbow made from Yggdrasil, and three arrows, each unique and powerful.</p><p>Â  Â  Â  Storjeger was originally worshipped only by the @UUID[JournalEntry.QlctNkzE9injOde9.JournalEntryPage.I4CpK8rTs0HgD7hW]{Vikmordere}, but in a very brief period before the @UUID[JournalEntry.QlctNkzE9injOde9.JournalEntryPage.DXD1ygEckY0JIUFB]{Klavekians} went to war with the Vikmordere, there was an exchange of information, including the tale of Storjeger.

Unaware of her true power and acting only of universal impulse, Vasi embraced earth, fire, and air, to create Aventyr itself, and through this formation, the freshwater with which to rain down and cover the world. While others would end up as caretakers over the brackish depths where earth and water bled too deeply together, Vasi was the guardian of it all.Â Â </p>\n<p>Â  Â  After she adopted to the needs of those mortals living in Aventyr, and after the Shard of the Sun nearly collided with the planet, Vasi took to caring for those lacking water, sending her clergy into the Scorched Lands to find, save, and possibly convert those who would surely have died in the desert wastes.Â Â </p>\n<h2>Churches, Clergy, and Worshippers</h2>\n<p>Vasiâs shrines and temples are found near deep grottos and remote mountain lakes, anywhere there is a clean source of freshwater, a small shrine is found nearby.

More than a physical being, as the insectoids came to dominate the planet of the alien godâs origin, Zagnexis manifested as the congealed consciousness of their dead. While the other intelligent lifeforms on that world fought valiantly, with a deific being directing the racial hive mind of the @UUID[JournalEntry.QlctNkzE9injOde9.JournalEntryPage.SGw7zGFtvjLNPDMY]{hoyrall}, they quickly came to rule over all that the insect god could perceive.</p>\n<p>Â Until the Great Schism. The progenitors, cast down from their once mythic forms into the lowly race now known as the draaki, made a desperate cry to the cosmos and it was Zagnexis that answered their plea. Mustering the unimaginable power granted from the complete devotion of an entire race of creatures, the insect god transported his entire physical form into AventyrâZagn, along with tens of thousands of hoyrallâdirectly across the universe and into the Dracoprimeâs skull, killing the draconic monstrosity instantly.</p>\n<p>Â  Â  For some generations, Exis continued to direct its children on Aventyr, growing a massive army within the fortress-hives of the hoyrall in preparation for an all-out assault to conquer both the surface and the Underworld. Were it not for the intervention of the colloid during The Confluence, it surely would have succeeded. The other alien entity seized upon Exis conduit to its children, breaking the hive mind of the hoyrall and sending its physical counterpart, Zagn, careening into the oceans of Aventyr to wreck havoc upon everything it meets.</p>\n<p>Â  Â  Since then, Exis has retained what connections it can to Aventyr, granting powers to its clerics and oracles but little more. The alien god wants nothing more than to expand and procreate, increasing its deific power by generating a second world of followers. Exis is avaricious and without regard for the general balance of natural powers; it will stop at nothing to re-establish its hold over both Zagn and the hoyrall before consuming all of Aventyr.</p>\n<h2>Appearance</h2>\n<p>Exis is a spectral insect composed of dozens of different arthropods, its countless limbs, heads, eyes and antennae constantly morphing into new shapes or variations. Zagn is an enormous, multi-headed (and multi-mouthed) segmented worm with thousands upon thousands of legs that span a body measured by miles.</p>\n<h2>Church of Zagnexis</h2>\n<p>Temples, churches and shrines devoted to the alien god are commonly found throughout the fortress-hives of the hoyrall and honeycombed into Upperworld mountains, but most are in terrible states of disrepair. The unrest following The Confluence led to the dissolution of hoyrall society, and the sites of worship to the god that once bound them all together were quickly targeted by dissenters and never-do-wells. New churches to Zagnexis are well-appointed and carefully kept, tiled with the carapace of insects in exquisite mosaics that depict the journey of the hoyrall.</p>\n<h2>Holy Text</h2>\n<p>There is no written or oral tradition to the worship of Zagnexis; lesser followers are taught the rites of worship through nonverbal communication (through limbs or antennae), and acolytes meld their minds with greater priests in ritual-driven meldings of the minds. Only this devout form of communication is fit for the transmission of the holiest information known to the worshippers of the insect god.</p>\n<p>Â </p>\n<p>Â </p>\n</div>","markdown":""},"_id":"BgaAYMVXk3L6daU4","image":{},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"sort":2200000,"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"JournalEntry.1nhWSRlTjP4u99gB.JournalEntryPage.vHtchpvGcDlwG7Ja"}}},{"sort":2150000,"name":"Xio","type":"text","_id":"o7Bl7XnxenERvjAq","title":{"show":false,"level":1},"image":{},"text":{"format":1,"content":"<div class=\"aventyr\"><p class=\"s5\">Xio</p><p><strong>Titles:</strong> The Eternal Combatant, Captain of Captains, The Blood Rage</p><p><strong>Home:</strong> Valhalla</p><p><strong>Symbol:</strong> A star crafted from five crossed swords surrounding a bleached skull</p><p><strong>Alignment:</strong> NE</p><p><strong>Portfolio:</strong> Bravery, Combat, War</p><p><strong>Domains:</strong> Destruction, Ferocity, Honor, Strength, War</p><p><strong>Favored Weapon:</strong> Warhammer and handaxe</p><p>Xio is the deity of battle, both honorable and otherwise; he goes wherever there is war or brings it to lands where it is not, ensuring constant and glorious battle.</p><h2>History</h2><p>None truly know when Xio came into existence, but it is said that as long as there has been conflict, he has been amongst those who fight.

Anyone whose business is war is almost unwillingly bound to the Captain of Captains, and his blessing is known to turn the tide of battle on numerous occasions. His clergy are most often those who begin war, or followers that find peace where it exists and start a violent conflict. Most lands find these warmongers to be no better than bandits (worse than most) resulting in an almost world-spanning bounty for Xioâs clergyâa fact which they relish, meeting each new bounty-hunter with zeal and their godâs greatest blessings.</p><h2>Holy Text</h2><p><em>The Business of War</em><br />Though there are strategic insights to be gleaned from these heavy tomes, the business of war is largely about relishing the glory of battle more than how to conduct it.</p><p>Â </p></div>","markdown":""},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{"core":{"sheetClass":""}}},{"sort":1250000,"name":"The Mother Spirit","type":"text","_id":"7JZLaCukpLMqn2R2","title":{"show":true,"level":1},"image":{},"text":{"format":1,"content":"<div class=\"aventyr\"><p class=\"s5\">The Mother Spirit</p><p><strong>Titles:</strong> The Great Mother, Leaf Gatherer, Four Heart</p><p><strong>Home:</strong> A nexus of the elemental planes of Air, Earth, Fire and Water</p><p><strong>Alignment:</strong> Neutral Good</p><p><strong>Portfolio:</strong> nature, creation, family</p><p><strong>Worshippers:</strong> @UUID[JournalEntry.QlctNkzE9injOde9.JournalEntryPage.myrc4omqUaiD3RKZ]{Halfling}and fey of @UUID[JournalEntry.PCe82J4UbHQWFYYL]{Picollo}, and those who believe in the Four Winds theory of creation.</p><p><strong>Domains:</strong> Air, Community, Earth, Fire and Water</p><p><strong>Subdomains:</strong> Family, Metal, Wind, Oceans</p><p><strong>Favored Weapon:</strong> Unarmed strike</p><h2>History</h2><p>Worshipers of the Mother Spirit believe that when the elements came together to form the world, a vessel was required to prevent disastrous interaction between opposed elements. The Mother Spirit gathered the elements into her four-chambered heart to allow them to work in community to craft the world.</p><h2>Appearance</h2><p>The Mother Spirit most often appears as a halfling woman with fey or otherworldy features. She wears a homespun brown robe woven with simple leaf patterns. Her hair is that of autumn leaves, tinged with flame. The presence of the other three elements can be found in her ever present tears of alternating joy and sadness, the comforting breath of her voice, and the adamantine sheen of her forearms and hands.</p><h2>Church of The Great Mother</h2><p>Although worshipped primarily in @UUID[JournalEntry.PCe82J4UbHQWFYYL]{Picollo}, knowledge of the Great Mother has been brought to other areas of Aventyr by halflings displaced by the Great Schism, or fey wandering throughout the lands as their whimsy takes them.</p><h2>Worshippers and Clergy</h2><p>Priests usually dress in homespun robes and go about unarmed. Clerics of the Great Mother must select the community domain (or family subdomain) as one of their domains, but may select any of the elemental domains or subdomains as their second. The prestige class, devotee of the Four Hearts, grants access to additional elemental domains.</p><p>Clerics with the separatist archetype can often be found. The Great Mother recognizes that there are many paths to community, and loves these âFallen Leavesâ as much as any other worshipper, hoping they will one day embrace community as a tenet of faith.</p><h3>Fallen Leaf cleric</h3><p>Fallen Leaves are clerics of the Mother Spirit Mastering the divine nature of dual elements requires further study, available only to the Devotee of the Four Hearts.</p><h3>Devotee of the Four Hearts</h3><p>Devotees of the Four Hearts are worshipers of the Mother Spirit who seek to understand more fully the act of creation initiated by the joining of all four of the elements through a deeper examination of the elements themselves. As their understanding increases, they add additional domains to their repertoire of gifts from the goddess.</p><p><strong>Role:</strong> A Devotee of the Four Hearts is more prepared to deal with elemental challenges than her less erudite brothers and sisters. Because the theological study of the elements is deeply intertwined with the nature of the goddess, the scaling of the holy abilities of these priests are less impacted with a diversion into a prestige class.</p><p><strong>Alignment:</strong> Most members of this prestige class tend to be neutral or neutral good to better understand the balance required in bringing together the elements. Lawful clerics embrace the discipline of safeguarding the elements and the world around them while those elements join in community, whereas chaotic priests embrace the messiness of creation.</p><h2>Holy Text: The Tree of Community</h2><p>Temples to the goddess are centered around a great tree which forms the center of the complex, regardless of its architectural style (or design of the grove in cases of a fey temple). The leaves of the tree contain the holy writings of the Mother, as well as the stories of her worshippers, unnumbered as the leaves themselves. Divination and prophetic magic is often tied to, or enhanced by, the tree of community; to read oneâs leaf is to gain insight to oneâs soul.</p><p></p><p></p></div>","markdown":""},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}},{"sort":1950000,"name":"Qathindli","type":"text","_id":"jjNtg5QMfe2uI6uS","title":{"show":false,"level":1},"image":{},"text":{"format":1,"content":"<div class=\"aventyr\"><p class=\"s5\">Qathindli</p><p><strong>Titles:</strong> The Monkey Primeval, The Unsullied</p><p><strong>Home:</strong> @UUID[JournalEntry.dHHrcptCELfN05gb.JournalEntryPage.eOVkEXkbiSWbkVcp#treeland]{Treeland}</p><p><strong>Alignment:</strong> Chaotic Neutral</p><p><strong>Symbol:</strong> A monkey face with a painted boomerang for a smiling mouth (only used by humans)</p><p><strong>Portfolio:</strong> Nature, Primates, Wilderness</p><p><strong>Worshippers:</strong> Monkeys and disparate or relocated people from the @UUID[JournalEntry.g4odaMsHbRkeNFhn]{Vast Swamp} or the @UUID[JournalEntry.dHHrcptCELfN05gb]{Yerek Steppes}</p><p><strong>Domains:</strong> Animal, Chaos, Plant, Protection</p><p><strong>Favored Weapon:</strong> Boomerang</p><p></p><p>Two hundred years ago, Mentane Flamebearer, a human cleric of a best-forgotten god, and Golar, his half-orc monk bodyguard landed on the eastern shore of what would become @UUID[JournalEntry.dHHrcptCELfN05gb.JournalEntryPage.eOVkEXkbiSWbkVcp#treeland]{Treeland}. The reason for the visit was that Mentane thought he had found a way to become a god. His hypothesis was that if he could instill the magical essences that he acquired daily into the same place for a long period of time, then the release of that pent up energy into himself would push him past the boundary of mortality and into the realm of godhood. Mentane chose a small fuzzy fruit with a green interior, called a forhoral, which grew on a vine as his receptacle of power.</p><p>As they settled on the eastern edge of the forest Golar began to notice the large numbers of primates in the forest. Ignoring them, Mentane had Golar find a piece of wood to allow the vines of the fruit grow upward.</p><p>For the next year, every morning, Mentane would slowly and carefully direct his magical energies into the seed that he had planted. Golar, not being needed, wandered the forest. Some of the primates took interest in the two for a while, but seeing that they were no immediate threat, they were content to ignore the two.</p><p>After about a month, one small chimpanzee began following the Golar as he explored what would become known as Treeland. He began to call her âQathindli,â which translated roughly to âsmall oneâ in his local Orcish dialect. He would call and wave to her every morning and she would chatter back at him.</p><p>Something surprising that Golar noticed was that Qathindli would watch him when he went through his morning exercises. She would sit on a branch and stare at him while he moved in slow, deliberate patterns. She had taken a special liking to his three-bladed boomerang. When she wasnât watching him practice, he would almost always find her at his pack, holding the throwing weapon. Eventually, he carved her her own two-bladed boomerang and placed a leather strap around the two ends. She took it with her everywhere.</p><p>As the year progressed, Mentaneâs fruit began to grow, becoming larger than usual for this type of fruit. The vine grew quickly up the post and one year to the day of its planting, Mentane emerged from his tent, ready to become a god.</p><p>His forhoral fruit was gone. In its place, he found Qathindli sitting on the forest floor, holding the remains of the forhoral fruit.</p><p>She sat and stared, her monkey mind not comprehending what was happening to her.</p><p>Mentane began ranting and raving about the amount of effort he put into the project and his loss to a monkey. In his rage, he was preparing to utterly destroy Qathindli when she turned her head toward him and shocked both he and Golar.</p><p>âWhat is happening to me?â she asked loudly and haltingly.</p><p>All three stared at each other for a moment before Qathindli screeched and ran off into the forest.</p><p>A few days later, Mentane packed up his belongings and stowed them on the boat. He was going to make his way back to the @UUID[JournalEntry.QVrlu0lTv2vFtT5P]{Klavek Kingdom}. Golar said that he was going to stay in the forest for the time being. They bade each other farewell and Golar watched Mentane sail off into the sunrise.</p><p>Golar found Qathindli her near her tribe of monkeys. She was speaking quickly and erratically, words from every language spilling out of her mouth. Golar understood words from a few languages and recognized several more. The other monkeys were frightened of her.</p><p>Using food, Golar tempted Qathindli out of her tree and through a long and arduous process, explained what Mentane had done with the forhoral fruit and that his best guess was that when she had eaten the fruit, she had absorbed all of the magical power invested in it and that she had become more than a monkey.</p><p>Over the course of the next six months, Golar taught Qathindli control thanks to his martial training. While she did learn how to focus her newly found thoughts, she was still a monkey inside. Her train of thought often derailed into a conglomeration of words from different languages, which made it difficult for Golar to understand.</p><p>The change in her standing among the primates came when, as she and Golar were training in a small clearing, a wild boar broke through the undergrowth and charged at Golar. Though the battle was brief, it was also incredibly violent. In the end, the boar lay dead and Golar had numerous cuts and slashes from the boarâs wicked tusks. Qathindli rushed out from her hiding place and chattered at Golar in numerous languages as he started to succumb to his injuries. As he tumbled to the ground, Qathindli placed her hands on him and with a visible light, poured healing energy into Golar.</p><p>The forest around the two of them went silent as the watchful monkeys around them looked on and saw the power that Qathindli now possessed.</p><p>While she may not have been a demigoddess in the classical sense, Qathindli has eclipsed monkeyhood and is something more. She had decided to be the protector of Treeland, which she named herself. When she accepted that mantle, she became a demigoddess.</p><h2>Appearance</h2><p>Qathindli can change her appearance to that of any primate in existence, except human. Her preferred form is a pygmy monkey that stands roughly six inches tall, with bright red hair. This form seems to cause less violent reactions in those that she speaks with than one of her larger shapes.</p><p>Each of her forms has a face that is like the race she is interacting with than it is monkey-like.</p><h2>Church</h2><p>Even though she doesnât understand it, the humans that live in @UUID[JournalEntry.dHHrcptCELfN05gb.JournalEntryPage.eOVkEXkbiSWbkVcp#treeland]{Treeland} worship Qathindli. The services are held outside usually around midday, but it varies due to the weather.</p><p>The leader of the humans, Damon, teaches that the people of his tribe should live like the monkeys: in harmony with nature. Because of his worship, Qathindli grants him spells, even if she doesnât know how she does that.</p><h2>Worshippers &amp; Clergy</h2><p>Qathindiâs worshippers are all of the humans that live in Treeland, under the guidance of her only clergy member, @UUID[JournalEntry.dHHrcptCELfN05gb.JournalEntryPage.Tc1kTiX3bvQt4Jd7#damon]{Damon}. One of the titles Damon has given Qathindli is âThe Unsullied.â He believes that she is holy because she has never been human, and therefore is above us and unsullied by her nature.</p><h2>Holy Text</h2><p>Qathindli has no holy text to speak of. As her knowledge of language grows, she has had Golar and Damon try to teach her how to write. The two main problems are that monkey hands are not designed for holding human writing utensils and Qathindli still has the mind of a monkey, so any given sentence contains multiple languages and bad translations, making them impossible to read. Damon still collects these âwritingsâ and keeps them safe.</p></div>","markdown":""},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}}],"_stats":{"systemId":"dnd5e","systemVersion":"2.1.2","coreVersion":"10.291","createdTime":1662054505131,"modifiedTime":1673782392581,"lastModifiedBy":"EsIYTtNnjwxUbKOG"},"ownership":{"default":0,"R5IsvMTH5P79pBoG":3},"folder":"j9cXBagzZ1ARsO2I","sort":1000000}],"scenes":[],"tables":[],"macros":[],"cards":[],"playlists":[],"folders":[{"name":"Aventyr Campaign","type":"JournalEntry","folder":null,"description":"","sorting":"a","sort":0,"color":"#ef0b0b","flags":{"scene-packer":{"hash":"8caef5da4ecea50a179ae7ce85917b9295172db1"}},"_stats":{"systemId":"dnd5e","systemVersion":"2.1.2","coreVersion":"10.291","createdTime":null,"modifiedTime":1673690795875,"lastModifiedBy":"EsIYTtNnjwxUbKOG"},"_id":"j9cXBagzZ1ARsO2I"}],"_id":"hzmyEpc8aOhwDV0b","flags":{},"_stats":{"systemId":"dnd5e","systemVersion":"2.1.2","coreVersion":"10.291","createdTime":1666290799393,"modifiedTime":1673793563990,"lastModifiedBy":"EsIYTtNnjwxUbKOG"}}

Most frequently this is during war, where neither the unhelpful morality of good and evil nor the confusion and disorder of chaos allow for clear decisions to be made and victory achieved. The Axiomatic General appears wherever clear-thinking, considered tactics, and balanced plans are being prepared or followed. While the field of war is the usual site for these activities, the Axiomatic General has been known to appear during complicated but emotionless court cases, and sometimes even when the cold, detached clarity of true monkish enlightenment is reached.</p>\n<p>The Axiomatic General is neither male nor female, instead being a creature devoid of physically distracting bias. It can appear as a female or male of any humanoid species, whichever form is most likely to aid with clarity of decision making.</p>\n<h2>Dogma</h2>\n<p>The Axiomatic General and its followers wish to bring the clarity of law to those places that currently live in emotional turmoil and to demonstrate to all the axiomatic nature of law when applied to war, legal frameworks, and personal actions. It expects its believers to instigate and adhere to meaningful laws while at the same time exposing and amending those which are ludicrous, outlandish, convoluted, unenforceable, or contrary. The Overseer of War abhors any decision or process that allows an individual to take unfair advantage of another, either through methods such as emotional blackmail, the abuse of personal power, or as a result of chance. It encourages its followers to engage in long-term ordered âwarsâ rather than short-and-sharp fightsâthe chaos of battle is well known, but by carefully considering oneâs options, testing oneâs theories, and then following through with a well-conceived plan, one can make their way to victory in an ordered manner. If all around them are clear about their intentions, one can see their actions are as fair and just as possible, and that trade and public prosperity, the courts, and the growth of society as a whole can continue during even the greatest of conflicts.</p>\n<p>The Lord of All Wars promotes careful consideration in all matters and expects its followers to be able to provide self-evident truths for all their actions. Haste, guesswork, and self-indulgence lead to reliance on emotion and base, uncontrolled actions. It disapproves of reliance on government or any religious institution that fosters blind trust or, even worse, unprovable belief, explaining that those with sound judgement, mental discipline, and an unshakeable grasp of sensible, irrefutable laws can overcome the inauthentic evidence and invalid arguments of the emotional and chaotic masses.</p>\n<h2>History</h2>\n<p>Once a mortal humanoid, the Axiomatic General ascended to become deified, although it is unclear what exactly it once was as virtually all races have a legendary historical figure that has risen from the mortal ranks to those of the divine after following the path of a great warrior who tirelessly supported its deity. What is evident is that the Overseer of War became more powerful than this original deity and ended up judging it at the culmination of a long conflict. The Lord of All Warâs final verdict and victory provided the energy and evidence needed for the warrior to rise to godhood itself.</p>\n<p>The Axiomatic General tends to appear in history (as the simple warrior of its humanoid type) when the raceâs pre-eminent lawful deity first wages war against more than one non-lawful foe, whether they be good, evil, or chaotic. It goes by many titles (a few of which appear above) but always has the ability to make clear, concise, and entirely accurate decisions even in the heat and fog of combat. Tales invariably tell of the Overseer of War having to uphold the lawful aims and ambitions of another deityâs followers when the god or goddess itself proves to be weak and fallible. Then the Axiomatic General steps in to save those same worshipers before judging the god in question and finding it wanting. After this, it takes the fight to the enemy, turns the tide of the war with unquestionable judgement, and becomes a deity in its own right. After this, the Lord of All Wars is always found leading those who know its words to be the truth through conflict, disagreement, and disputeâa reliable route to absolute, undeniable victory.</p>\n<h2>Relationships</h2>\n<p>The Overseer of War is entirely dismissive of any and all other deities that do not in some part embrace lawful beliefs. While those that promote chaos feel its full wrath, the Axiomatic General constantly seeks to disprove the tenets of neutral good and neutral evil deities because of their reliance on sentimental or self-centred emotions. It tolerates lawful good and lawful evil gods as long as their lawful nature is at the forefront of their actions, and is just as likely to support a lawfully-minded archon in a conflict against an evil devil as it is a lawfully-minded devil that wages war against an overly-good archon; ultimately, the balance of law is what is important.</p>\n<p>The Axiomatic General is opposed by all those who promote personal choice, uncontrolled actions, and âbeliefââit is guaranteed to come into conflict with deities that support and nurture bards and barbarians, and frequently with those that nurture wild sorcerers. Because it is so closely linked with conclusive and categorical truth, the Lord of All Wars sometimes finds itself on the side of sages, experts, philosophers and academics that devote their lives to uncovering a lost or hidden truth, whether military, legal, commercial, or magical.</p>\n<h2>Appearance</h2>\n<p>The Axiomatic General usually appears as a healthy, vibrant member of the appropriate race and can be either female or male (or neither). Its clothing is always practical for the situation but is clearly designed to instil confidence and invariably a bright white. The godâs symbol, the decorated iron rod, is sewn into the space above the heart and mimicked by the weapon it wields. The Overseer of War always carries a +3 axiomatic brilliant energy light mace, the look and effect of which are in line with the main domain of the senior cleric in the vicinity as follows:</p>\n<table style=\"float:left;width:99.5833%;height:113px\" border=\"1\">\n<tbody>\n<tr style=\"height:32.5px\">\n<td style=\"width:47.7664%;height:32.5px;background-color:#000000;border-color:#ffffff\">\n<h3><span style=\"color:#ffffff\"><strong>Domain</strong></span></h3>\n</td>\n<td style=\"width:52.2358%;height:32.5px;background-color:#000000;border-color:#ffffff\">\n<h3><span style=\"color:#ffffff\"><strong>Rod type</strong></span></h3>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height:20.125px\">\n<td style=\"width:47.7664%;height:20.125px;background-color:#ecf0f1;border-color:#000000\">Law</td>\n<td style=\"width:52.2358%;height:20.125px;background-color:#ecf0f1;border-color:#000000\">Alertness</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height:20.125px\">\n<td style=\"width:47.7664%;height:20.125px;background-color:#ecf0f1;border-color:#000000\">Nobility</td>\n<td style=\"width:52.2358%;height:20.125px;background-color:#ecf0f1;border-color:#000000\">Splendour</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height:20.125px\">\n<td style=\"width:47.7664%;height:20.125px;background-color:#ecf0f1;border-color:#000000\">Strength</td>\n<td style=\"width:52.2358%;height:20.125px;background-color:#ecf0f1;border-color:#000000\">Flailing</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height:20.125px\">\n<td style=\"width:47.7664%;height:20.125px;background-color:#ecf0f1;border-color:#000000\">War</td>\n<td style=\"width:52.2358%;height:20.125px;background-color:#ecf0f1;border-color:#000000\">Rulership</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>Legends dictate that the Axiomatic General occasionally appears as a fully advanced, adamantine-coated marut, but the last occasion this was recorded was many generations ago.</p>\n<h2>Providence</h2>\n<p>Followers and clergy of the Lord of All Wars know that clarity of planning, deeper understanding of the way forward, or insight into a problem that has been gained after careful thought and consideration has come from their deity. This knowledge doesnât appear suddenly but is the reward for taking time and exploring all possibilities. The Oversee of War thinks highly of those who consider their options before acting decisively, as well as of those who follow through with long-term plans without faltering.</p>\n<p>Any sign of plans failing, the confusion reigning, or participants not understanding their role is seen as a sign that the Axiomatic General is displeased and expects greater discipline and forethought.</p>\n<h2>Servants</h2>\n<p>The Axiomatic General rewards those who organize well and keep to agreed plans, no matter how long this may take. These machinations often take many generations in the case of shorter-lived humanoids such as goblinoids and humans, or the entire life of the longest-living elves. Servants must be prepared to sacrifice the immediate for the longer term, understand that they may lose those around them today for the betterment of a lawful population tomorrow, and recognize that the needs of a lawful future outweigh any considerations here and now.</p>\n<p>The Overseer of War grants particular favour to those who constantly uphold the lawâinevitables are viewed with esteem alongside formians and other hive-minded creatures. Followers that devote themselves to a lifetime of achieving a long-term lawful aim regularly receive insight and clarity from their god. Humanoids that either spend a significant portion of their time gaining greater insight into a particular path or are able to rapidly judge the features and benefits of a number of possibilities before quickly making the correct decision often gain a divine hint or two.</p>\n<h2>The Church of the Axiomatic General</h2>\n<p>Sites of worship to the Lord of All Wars serve one purpose: to ensure that correct decision are made to further indisputable truth. They range in size from an officerâs table in their tent, a simple sand tablet on which a cleric explains a truth, or in a lawyerâs or sageâs rooms, to the chambers of a countryâs most magnificent courtroom, the order flags at the front line of the latest battle in a war, or the grandest library within the @UUID[JournalEntry.QVrlu0lTv2vFtT5P]{Klavek Kingdom} most spectacular cathedral to the Axiomatic General. Churches to this god are all simple, plain affairs that remove mental distraction and clutter at the same time as allowing axioms and tenets spoken by the Overseer of War to be spread effectively and efficiently.</p>\n<p>Worship of the Axiomatic General is frequently silent as followers consider practical issues at hand as well as long-term problems that require a more considered solution. Followers frequently engage in debates, most of which are serious but enjoyable affairsâthere is no time for frivolous thought when the Lord of All Warâs tenets are involvedâalthough there is no sense of âvictory or defeatâ in these sessions (the aim is to reach the truest, most accurate solution to a question, and everybody learns something.) When necessary, churches of the Overseer of War provide a neutral meeting point between warring factions of good and evil, although only the most experienced and senior of clergy attempt to mediate between chaotic elements. The Axiomatic General has shown that the wisest course for followers of law is to work together to overcome chaos through any means possible before resolving philosophical and personal lawful differences using contemplation and debate.</p>\n<p>The clergy of the Overseer of War organize themselves in a clear and obvious hierarchy in the same way that any modern military, business, or courtroom would do. Similarly, religious and educational centres that follow the Axiomatic General have a plain structure in place that shows who has best demonstrated an understanding of the godâs aims and objectives. No matter where or how the Lord of All War is followed, its churches are defined by their grasp of unequivocal truths, unimpeachable laws, unbeatable tactics, and unquestionable enlightenment. Churches that exhibit knowledge over belief and can demonstrate undeniable evidence for these truths have the greatest standing, no matter what their size. Worshipers rise up the ranks in the same way: anyone who can establish irrefutable knowledge and information is given ever greater responsibilities. At the same time, mistakes arenât considered a failure if the individuals concerned can show they did all they could to establish clarity and a considered answer. All they have to do is recognize that further investigation has produced better knowledge and make sure they donât repeat the mistake. As the Lord of All Wars is happy to develop plans over many generations, errors that can be rectified bear little consequence.</p>\n<p>Churches worshipping the Axiomatic General are openly found in the centre of lawful societies and on the outskirts of those populations with no preference for law or chaos but are seemingly absent from chaotic cultures. The Overseer of War prefers his followers to surround such cultures and gradually move inwards until the chaos is crushed out of themâa process that takes as long as is necessary, designed to ensure no worshiper is tricked into joining chaos from within.</p>\n<p>Services to the Axiomatic General are ordered affairs, comprising either contemplation of the truth or respectful presentation of findings and subsequent decision-making they influence. In all situations, there is ample opportunity for everyone who wants to speak to do so, although followers recognize the need to act swiftly during war situations and develop a truncated, precise style of presenting their findings.</p>\n<h2>Worshipers</h2>\n<p>The Axiomatic General is primarily worshipped by military officers but also draws in judges, lawyers, barristers, sages, monks, and those who would advance society in an ordered and structured way. Those who indulge in chaotic thoughts and acts are ignored at all times.</p>\n<h2>Clergy</h2>\n<p>The clergy of the Overseer of War are not necessarily clerics, although if they arenât they are only allowed to represent the god within their own sphere of expertise and influence (for example, military officers can only lead services and discussions about military matters). Any member of the clergy who is a cleric is required to lead a service in an overarching capacity even if the content is decided by the senior subject expert. In all situations, the most experience cleric leads a service, with assistance as appropriate from other members of the congregation.</p>\n<p>The Axiomatic General does not support paladins, despite their martial outlook. Their tendency towards good leads them to not always consider the balanced needs of a lawful life, which in turn means their judgment isnât always going to be the best it can be in some situations.</p>\n<h2>Temples and Shrines</h2>\n<p>Buildings devoted to the Lord of All Wars are functional, unadorned, designed to serve all aspects of the godâs tenets, yet clearly focused on one domain more than others (whatever that may be). It isnât unusual for there to be four temples next to each otherâone for each aspect of devotion with followers visiting whichever is most appropriate for their needs.</p>\n<p>All sites of worship have one item in common: a magical lead box with an amazing lock that holds a copy of the four holy texts of the Axiomatic General (The Four Planes of Certain Truth) plus one additional book of specific thoughts on the area of expertise of the congregation. These boxes are identical as adornment or elaboration is forbidden as an unnecessary distraction, and are always at the centre of any service of worship or decision-making process. Whenever the box is locked after its final use for the day, the text within each book is updated via divine intervention if a more accurate and truthful version of any piece of information has been discovered and when new facts have been uncovered.</p>\n<p>Each place of worship also contains the thought processes of anyone who has worked to uncover indisputable truths, as well as the evidence that demonstrates that truth. Whenever someone is uncovering a new truth, their work-in-progress materials are stored here as well.</p>\n<h2>Holy Texts</h2>\n<p>The Four Planes of Certain Truth contain the pertinent and unequivocal statements confirmed by the Axiomatic General. When stored in their magical box they are updated via divine intervention when it is locked at the end of the day. No decision is made without this box being present, even if it isnât used. Clerics of the Overseer of War receive notification of changes as part of their meditation; all clerics and service leaders are encouraged to learn the texts by heart (as interpretation isnât required).</p>\n<p>Each book bears a simple cover, binding, and little decoration other than an iron rod over a stylized letter that identifies its contents. Other documents stored at temples and shrines have these two symbols plus the initials of the author and the date of publication. When any document is superseded, the date of its relegation from cannon is stamped on the cover and the original symbols are scored through.</p>\n<p>Â </p>\n<h3><em><strong>Axioms of War</strong></em></h3>\n<p>This contains the latest approved plans for war as a whole, as well as tactics for individual fights. The core contentâwhen consulted prior to a battleâconfers both a confidence-boosting and calming effect as it confirms how its actions bring eventual victory in the war (with that dayâs battle an important part of it). Chapters detail the stages of engagement and explain the surest way forward at each point. They describe how a lawful plan can be overcome by the sheer weight of chaos, but also how to learn from that experience and counter it in the next battle.</p>\n<p>Â </p>\n<p>Â </p>\n<h3><em><strong>Axioms of Law</strong></em></h3>\n<p>This contains the latest approved plans for passing legal judgment as a whole, as well as tactics for individual cases. When consulted prior to establishing guilt or innocence, it confers both a clarity- and authority-boosting effect as it confirms how its actions ensure the correct judgment is reached. Chapters detail the stages of ascertaining the truth from all that has been presented as evidence as well as methods to consider it in an effective, efficient, and impartial manner. They also describe how well-made laws can be twisted and broken by the inherently devious, and how to rewrite those laws to ensure this doesnât happen in future.</p>\n<p>Â </p>\n<p>Â </p>\n<h3><em><strong>Axioms of Decisions</strong></em></h3>\n<p>This contains the latest methods and directions for effective and efficient meditation as well as long-established research techniques from the churchâs greatest sages and experts. When consulted before an investigation is started, it confers a mind-clearing and attention-focusing effect as it confirms how its actions allow a user to reveal the most pertinent and accurate information. Chapters detail how to consider what needs to be discovered, how to ensure what is found matches the initial requirements, and then how to use the information to make the correct decision. They also describe how distraction, obfuscation, and distortion of aims and objects (such as shortcuts) lead to an incorrect decision with long-term consequences.</p>\n<p>Â </p>\n<p>Â </p>\n<h3><em><strong>Axioms of Enlightenment</strong></em></h3>\n<p>This contains pathways to understanding the world at large and the part one plays in that world as well as how the best of life is achieved through the order. When consulted before meditating, it confers an open-mindedness that ensures the route to enlightenment is properly followed as it confirms how its actions allow a user to reach self-knowledge without deviation or distraction. Chapters give details on what to do before, during, and after meditation, as well as how to realize enlightenment has been reached. They also describe how our contemplation can be lessened by the actions of others, but how these digressions can be overcome and enlightenment eventually reached.</p>\n<h2>Holidays</h2>\n<p>The Axiomatic General is not celebrated at any specific festivals. Instead, when the law prevails during any of the godâs areas of interest, followers offer a prayer of thanks no more than 30 minutes after the event. If gratitude is shown later than this, it probably means the follower was distracted from the task at hand and has acted in a chaotic way to make the thanks fit in. Better to acknowledge the effect of the Overseer of War with oneâs body and mind than take yourself away from a pressing matter and make two situations chaotic.</p>\n<p>Â </p>\n<p>Â </p>\n<p>Â </p>\n<p>Â </p>\n<p>Â </p>\n</div>","markdown":""},"_id":"OB8fp8gIre5yoZax","image":{},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"sort":400000,"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"JournalEntry.0FSVjV3WkdoAk7OX.JournalEntryPage.K8IEnGHHZ3800Nio"}}},{"name":"Ancestor Spirit","type":"text","title":{"show":false,"level":1},"text":{"format":1,"content":"<div class=\"aventyr\">\n<p class=\"s5\">Ancestor Spirit</p>\n<img style=\"margin:0px 10px 10px 0px;border:0px;float:right\" src=\"modules/aaw-games-aventyr/Deities-Images/waterfall_edit-scaled.webp\" width=\"244\" height=\"698\" />\n<p><strong>Titles: </strong>Breath of Life, Life Spirit</p>\n<p><strong>Home: </strong>Positive energy plane</p>\n<p><strong>Alignment: </strong>NG</p>\n<p><strong>Portfolio: </strong>Ancestor, nature, wilderness, wisdom</p>\n<p><strong>Worshippers:</strong> @UUID[JournalEntry.QlctNkzE9injOde9.JournalEntryPage.I4CpK8rTs0HgD7hW]{Vikmordere}</p>\n<p><strong>Domains: </strong>Animal, Community, Plant</p>\n<p><strong>Subdomains: </strong>Ancestors, Seasons, Souls</p>\n<p><strong>Favored Weapon: </strong>Wooden staff</p>\n<p>The Ancestor Spirit venerates reconnection with nature, and exploration of oneâs inner being without the scourge of individual financial gain.</p>\n<p>Â  Â  The pure energy which forms this deity is comprised of the souls of the original ancient settlers of the @UUID[JournalEntry.QVrlu0lTv2vFtT5P]{Klavek Kingdom}/@UUID[JournalEntry.Cg0Nt8mDPQ7JrmyB]{Vikmordere}.

He was dissatisfied; dwarves had become a lesser race, overcome by the @UUID[JournalEntry.QlctNkzE9injOde9.JournalEntryPage.8HyVcZ70eyhwNJsu]{Drow}, among others. His life was punctuated by constant struggle and heroic feats that are the things of legend: he re-mastered the lost arts of metalworking once known by his ancestors; he defended his homeland single-handedly against creatures of the Underworld, and he built himself a flawless suit of unbreakable armour. Inside this shell, he was an unstoppable force, and Balir took back thousands of miles of once-dwarven lands. He rose higher than any before making the fatal flaw of offering his hand in peace to the drow.</p>\n<p>The story goes that the Drow cast a curse of burning into his unbreakable armour, sealing the dwarf inside and setting it ablaze forever. But at this moment the gods saw Balir as the greatest martyr of his people and granted him a spark of divinity; he awoke as a god, still within the armour that had become his tomb, and departed the mortal realm.</p>\n<p>Having risen from the ranks of mortals, Balir has been forced to prove himself to the gods over and over again, showing them he is worthy. His feats as a god are no less than his feats as a mortal, although they take place in realms far beyond manâs comprehension. It is from one of these divine toils that he claimed his mighty hammer, Soul Forger â a weapon clearly claimed from a creature many times larger than Balir himself.</p>\n<p>Even as he found himself a god, Balir kept his destroyed mortal form as a sign of his penance. Instead of divine flesh, he constructed a metal body for himself to replace the one he lost. This new skin is without the flaw of mercy that destroyed him as a mortal. And although Balirâs scarred face is unmistakably dwarven, his body is anything but. A cast of white mithral and black iron, he appears more machine than man. Now, even with his drow-cursed armour destroyed, he still blazes with the murderous fire; in his chest, he carries a spark from which the sun was born. When he does not appear in his divine form, Balir assumes the guise of a young dwarf, typically bearing scars on his face and arms from flame.</p>\n<h2>Churches, Clergy, and Worshippers</h2>\n<p>Churches to Balir are at once humble and magnificent. Their areas of worship are simple and unadorned, although always practical, in a manner befitting dwarven life itself. Whether the smallest shrine or grandest cathedral, sites dedicated to Balir always stand near a place of work, toil, and creation. In them, they are guided by Balirâs ancient knowledge and secrets to produce machines, mechanical goods, and works of active art unlike anywhere else in the world. Balirâs clergy are predominantly dwarven, although some humans do acclaim his faith as well. Where they can, they dress in mithral and crimson â styling themselves after their god. Poorer members of the faith dress instead in white and yellow. Worshippers almost always offer constructed items as their offering. If they do resort to just money, itâs always directed toward a newly-qualified crafter or a promising apprentice.</p>\n<h2>Holy Text</h2>\n<p>The Life of Balir is unlike any standard book of holy teachings. Instead, this tome is almost three thousand pages long and details the thousand trials and tribulations of Balirâs life, written in such a way that it is more like a dwarven self-help book than divine instruction. Some versions have additional volumes discussing the merits of each action Balir took, although these are known to be opinions, not facts. The original text is unchanged from when it was penned by Balirâs own son, after the dwarfâs ascension to godhood.</p>\n</div>","markdown":""},"_id":"SjKuUjzrx9TNLn0y","image":{},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"sort":500000,"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"JournalEntry.EykWA9hRZOjLFz6G.JournalEntryPage.JtgEqWY5XOkGnzgZ"}}},{"name":"The Current","type":"text","title":{"show":false,"level":1},"text":{"format":1,"content":"<div class=\"aventyr\">\n<p class=\"s5\">The Current</p>\n<img style=\"float:right;margin:0px 10px 10px 0px;border:0px\" src=\"modules/aaw-games-aventyr/Deities-Images/The-Current.webp\" width=\"267\" height=\"316\" />\n<p><strong>Alignment:</strong> LN</p>\n<p><strong>Portfolio:</strong> Insanity, Mysticism, Seas, Underworld Waters, the Unknown</p>\n<p><strong>Domains:</strong> Madness (Nightmare), Magic (Arcane), Void (Dark Tapestry), Water (Oceans)</p>\n<p><strong>Favoured Weapon:</strong> Tentacle (whips, spiked chains)</p>\n<p><strong>Favored Animals:</strong> Octopus, Squid</p>\n<p>Â </p>\n<h2>History</h2>\n<p>The other deities of Aventyr are forever vigilant for even the slightest brush of the Currentâs tentacles in their plans or near their essence, keeping a respectful distance from the maddening god. Its motives are totally unpredictable, though it strikes swiftly and without warning when it is suited to do so. The affairs of the gods donât seem to bear any interest to the Current, however, and it is thought to be slumbering, like the massive beasts that lay in the ruins of the vestraadiâs ancient civilizations. Indeed, some believe that these enormous predators are somehow related to the maddening god and not without good reason; they appeared not long after the Current came to Aventyr.</p>\n<h2>Appearance</h2>\n<p>Records of The Currentâs appearance are extremely vague by necessity; those that look upon it are driven utterly mad. The few reliable accounts claim that it is floating, slithering or pulsating mass of writhing tentacles, the end of each covered in barbs of colours for which there is no shade or name.</p>\n<h2>Churches of the Maddening God</h2>\n<p>These revered houses of worship completely encompass those within them, covered in sculptures of tentacles that extend throughout the structure. The holiest of these churches are actually made from the recovered limbs of enormous squids and octopusesâthe architecture within them drives any non-followers of the Current to madness, afflicting any creature within with a form of insanity should they fail a DC 16 Wisdom saving throw.</p>\n<h2>Holy Text</h2>\n<p>No books exist for the religion of the maddening god; instead, the vestraadi keep song strings. When wound or unwound underwater, these magical cords play hymns of the Currentâs religion (in a tongue those that hear them can understand). The holiest and most valuable of these song strings are said to relate the true origins of the aquatic deity but are said to drive those that hear them mad with the voice of the Current, cursed to forever live with its echo in their mind.</p>\n<h2>Vast Swamp</h2>\n<p>@UUID[JournalEntry.g4odaMsHbRkeNFhn.JournalEntryPage.oIbJsrbNZu7GVWp9#the-muddy-mangroves]{The Muddy Mangroves} has always been the center of the Currentâs clergy in the Vast Swamp.

It is said, that beneath the cowl, he perpetually weeps.</p>\n<p>Â  Â When he does not appear in a humanoid form, he appears as a collection of dry autumn leaves blowing in the wind.</p>\n<h2>Church of Eureum</h2>\n<p>Much to his dismay, most of Eureumâs churches are misguided, focusing only on one aspect â either death or rebirth â and are often fanatical in their beliefs.

Her mother, Laelstra, was the Matronâs personal seeress. Hivaka possessed only the slightest of her motherâs magical abilities, mastering cantrips at an early age, but progressing no further. Being the youngest daughter, barely older than her only brother, and her sisters already being groomed for succession to various positions within the House, Hivaka found herself being used as leverage but almost everyone around her.</p>\n<p>Â  Â  Hivakaâs father, Elkerd, was first son of House Kilduis, allies of House Ruim. Among Elkerdâs vices was gamblingâhe never minded losing, as long as fun was had by all. The problems began when he started using House Kildiusâ assets to cover his wagers. When he was financially cut off from House Kilduis, he took the step of offering his youngest daughter, Hivaka, to the winner of a game of orbben. When Elkerd lost to Imfein of House Rilyntyl, a rival of House Kilduis, Hivaka was taken from her home by force. Laelstra protested, but there were too many reliable witnesses to the wager for her challenges to hold sway over her Matron. Thus, Hivaka was taken into slavery by House Rilyntyl. Laelstra attempted to buy Hivaka from Imfein, but was rebuffed, as having a bargaining chip against House Kilduisâ ally was worth much more than gold.</p>\n<p>Â  Â  Â Aside from the hard labour she and many others were forced to endure, Hivaka was treated wellâas well as a slave could be treated, anyway. She took her enforced servitude in stride, seeing as how she had almost never held any power of significance in her life. However, she harboured a hatred for her father, not understanding how a parent could blithely hand over their childâs life to another simply to cover a bet.</p>\n<p>Â  Â  Â The guards from House Imfein did not treat her any better or any worse than any of the other slaves. Neither did they prohibit her mother from visiting her occasionally during the evening, as long as no escape attempts were made. They did, however, restrain her from braining her father with her work hammer the one and only time he approached her during a shift of breaking up rocks. If not for the guards, Elkerd would have died violently, but possibly not quickly.</p>\n<p>Â  Â  Â Hivaka was a slave of House Imfein for almost a full year before Laelstra recruited a large following and put a plan into action that would free Hivak: she and her cohort would attack the Imfein guards at the slave pens during the night and Hivak would escape in the confusion while wearing the battle-dress of a House Imfein sorceress.</p>\n<p>Â  Â  Â  The assault appeared to be a success as chaos reigned in the slave pens, however, Laelstra had not anticipated two things: first, there were more guards than anticipated, causing longer holdups and more casualties as the attacking mob progressed. More guards also meant that an alarm could be sounded, bringing reinforcements, which compounded the existing issues with the rescue.</p>\n<p>Â  Â  The second issue was that Hivaka had determined that no matter where she was in drow society, she would be enslaved. Either to another house or within her own, where she would be used as a pawn in countless numbers of schemes by her Matron and her own family. As the youngest daughter, she held the lowest standing. Because of this, she was determined not to return to her home.</p>\n<p>Â  Â  Once in possession of the Imfein battle dress, Hivaka pulled the attached hood over her head and began leading slaves away, using her implied authority, along with some well-placed and spectacular-looking cantrips, to move them without interference. She had nearly one hundred slaves with her when they left the Xdot border.</p>\n<p>Â  Â Leading them on through the night, Hivaka found a narrow cave entrance that led into a larger cavern inside. Using the last of her available magicks, Hivaka attempted to cover the mouth of the cave with an illusion showing solid rock. The image was far more effective than Hivak knew because she and her group had attracted the attention of @UUID[.2MMXPI4kINBOYNOP]{Leacim}, the only known male drow deity.</p>\n<p>Â  Â  Â A trickster among the more serious drow goddesses, @UUID[.2MMXPI4kINBOYNOP]{Leacim} took this opportunity to thumb his nose at his sisters and to have fun, watching as the drow patrols searched the area over and over, never seeing past his illusions.</p>\n<p>Â  Â  Â The rescued slaves began worshipping Hivaka as a saviour. She resisted their praise, saying that she was simply another slave, like them. Leacimâknowing that these slaves needed someone to look up to, invested a small amount of his power in Hivaka, raising her above the mortals, but not so high as the divine: he made her a demigoddess.</p>\n<p>Â  Â  Â Those under her protection turned their new home into a town, called Nhlilolin, which has become a haven for the outcasts of the Underworld.</p>\n<h2>Appearance</h2>\n<p>Hivaka is short, for a drow, but heavily muscled from her time as a slave. Her light grey hair is kept short for a drow female, the ends reaching her jawline. Her eyes are blue, relatively rare in the Underworld, and if you look into them, you will find nothing but steely resolve.</p>\n<p>Â  Â Hivaka keeps her clothes simple, preferring pants and shirts that have pockets. The more pockets, the better. She is never anywhere without the hammer that she used to break the chains of the other slaves before leading them off into the night. Every morning or after any combat, she repairs the wooden handle with the mending cantrip.</p>\n<h2>Church of Hivaka</h2>\n<p>Hivaka, as a very recent demigoddess, does not have a church, but those that were rescued from imprisonment literally sing her praises every day. She downplays her role as a saviour or someone to be worshipped. She does have her devoted followers and, thanks to @UUID[.2MMXPI4kINBOYNOP]{Leacim}, she is able to grant them a small number of spells. She has not gained any paladins, though.</p>\n<h2>Worshippers and Clergy</h2>\n<p>Those who escaped with Hivaka are her greatest worshippers, but any who have escaped bondage freely speak her name with reverence. There is no set clergy in Nhilolin, but some apostles go out into the Underworld (and a few to the Upperworld) and speak against slavery, striving to free those that are held down, if only through word if not deed.</p>\n<p>Â  Â  Â Some of these preachers will gather the like-minded with them and attempt to free those taken by slavers.

Hivaka has tried to explain that the book, The Light of Hivaka and the Way Forward, brings attention to her and the town, which is mentioned by name in the book, and could lead to them all being recaptured.

Little is known to her followers of her true origins, only that she has proven to be an active and loyal spiritual force within the lives of those who never looked away from the older forms of worship.</p>\n<p>Â  Â Ja Qua exists within a sub-dimension connected to the mainlands of the Seelie Court and has fostered a deep relationship with the fey of her lands, looking upon them with the same love and care as her human followers. In turn, the fey has come to view her as one of their own and a revered person of power amongst their courts, and will not hesitate to interact on her behalf within her lands.</p>\n<h2>Appearance</h2>\n<p>Ja Qua appears in one of two forms when she chooses to appear at all. The first is that of a monstrously large and physically powerful jaguar, golden tawny in colour with spots that appear to shift and move before oneâs eyes. Crowned with a rim of bony protrusions across her brow and snout, there is no mistaking Ja Qua in her feline form as the self-appointed Queen of her lands. Her second form is one of far more subtlety, one of an attractive woman, typically still keeping the tawny colour of her pelt within her long hair. The colour of her eyes in human form is said to be indescribable, as no true colour exists within nature to compare them to, and her voice will both seduce and petrify you with fear in the same instant.</p>\n<h2>Church of Ja Qua</h2>\n<p>Ja Quaâs worship is strongest within the lands of @UUID[JournalEntry.RMK7HBFDlPXDiURg]{NaeraCull}, though there is the random shrine amongst a few forgotten uncivilized locations, where the march of progress has not severed all of humanity's connection to the Seelie Court yet.</p>\n<h2>Worshippers and Clergy</h2>\n<p>Those tribal warriors deemed worthy are put through a ritualistic challenge to earn Ja Quaâs Blessing, the gift of lycanthropy. Those who survive the process of transformation, and are not driven mad by the ritualistic pain they must go through to prove their worth find themselves in a position of honour amongst the tribes and temples, utilized as guardians and hunters, protecting both the faith and an ancient way of life. Dressed in only a loincloth these warriors tend to embrace the custom of adorning themselves with colourful trinkets and baubles to mark victories over adversaries, or glorious hunts.</p>\n<p>Â  Â Â Those of great enough faith, but not physical stamina to serve the tribes as warriors tend the temples and altars of Ja Qua as her loyal clerics. Over time those of the deepest devotion begin to acquire certain feline traits, though they never achieve the full embrace of Ja Qua as the temple warriors do.</p>\n<h2>Holy Text</h2>\n<p>Scattered throughout the jungle are many lost ruins of forgotten tribes, within which are wall carvings and bas-reliefs depicting the teachings of various points in the history of the church of Ja Qua. Most of the written language of the people of NairaCull is pictographic and has never been compiled into text or bound format, although it is rumoured that a man travels the jungle seeking to do just that.</p>\n<h2>The Dralman Documents</h2>\n<p>A skald of some renown, Theo Dralman was quested by the Grand University of @UUID[JournalEntry.QVrlu0lTv2vFtT5P.JournalEntryPage.dwAJ5Jtc6ii8zQoh]{Mohkba} to enter the dark jungle and learn all he could of the spirits to which the native people prayed, and how the @UUID[JournalEntry.QVrlu0lTv2vFtT5P]{Klavek Kingdom} could use this information to its own end. That was many years ago, and many of the legends spoken amongst the tribes that have encountered Dralman would lead one to believe that his goals have changed, and his search for knowledge has become something far more personal. Most of the legends speak of a man carrying a great many scars, as if he had been mauled to the edge of death, only to be spared and shown a new path. There exist a few rare copies of his incomplete work, taken to the coastal towns by couriers and those on safariâ¦the Dralman Documents they have become known as. All public possession of these documents within the borders of Klavekian-controlled lands is considered treasonous and punishable by seizure of properties and goods, as well as incarceration.</p>\n<p>Â </p>\n</div>","markdown":""},"_id":"21VmQoL4MPe6mX6q","image":{},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"sort":1100000,"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"JournalEntry.LQT16PQtjrxETCAe.JournalEntryPage.3JNs1m50QSpNDrdf"}}},{"name":"Leacim","type":"text","title":{"show":false,"level":1},"text":{"format":1,"content":"<div class=\"aventyr\">\n<p class=\"s5\">Leacim</p>\n<img style=\"float:right;margin:0px 10px 10px 0px;border:0px\" src=\"modules/aaw-games-aventyr/Deities-Images/Leacim.webp\" width=\"262\" height=\"371\" />\n<p><strong>Titles: </strong>The Clever Shadow</p>\n<p><strong>Symbol: </strong>Spinning 8-faceted gem</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary)\"><strong style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">Alignment: </strong>CN</span></p>\n<p><strong>Portfolio: </strong>Chance, Guile, Illusion, Misfortune, Self-Determination, Thieves</p>\n<p><strong>Domains: </strong>Chaos, Entropy, Deception, Luck, Trickery</p>\n<p><strong>Favoured</strong> <strong>Weapon:</strong> Scimitar, Shortbow, Throwing Knife</p>\n<p><strong>Favoured Animals:</strong> Any beast with camouflage or mimicry (such as a chameleon, stick bug, etc)</p>\n<p>Â </p>\n<h2>History</h2>\n<p>The Aventyr god known as Leacim was once a forgotten deity, supplanted by the doings of the colloid aeons before it ever reached the Underworld. Once a treasured god of cunning and wisdom, he was left bereft in the void of the cosmosâwhen Leacim stared into the void, something from the far beyond stared back. Now slightly deranged and without an identity, the god capered throughout the universe with a will and desire at the whim of his growing insanity.</p>\n<p>Â  Â Eventually, the divine energies wrought on Aventyr during the Forging of the Dvergr caught Leacimâs attention, drawing him to the periphery of the world to witness the rise of the progenitors and their fall into the draaki. It was the elven deities, however, that most interested the god of misfortuneâover hundreds of years, he subtly infiltrated their pantheon and species, attributing fanatical devotees in the very flesh before spreading them across both Upper- and Underworld. He appeared inexplicably among the elven pantheon, fully adopting the drow form and gathering followers both before and after their exodus from Edhellond.</p>\n<p>Â  Â  Â The most famous of these followers is @UUID[.fGrUoxdeUcElXl1w]{Hivaka} , the Savior of the Masses. Leacim took notice when she and her fellow slaves took flight from Xdot. He imparted the aspiring dark elf with some of his divine essences, forever transforming her into a demigoddess.</p>\n<p>Â  Â Leacim continues to take an active (albeit underhanded) role in the continued existence of the drow. He travels through the Underworld, briefly touching the souls of dark elves and morphing their alignments towards chaos, neutrality or even goodness if it suits his mood. The lone raider Dâthul, a cannibalistic sorcerer-barbarian in the Fungi Forest near Holoth, is one such drow. Those on the surface often see their lives subtly influenced by the trickster god, and Leacim leads them to roles of dubious natures and unexpected rewards.</p>\n<h2>Special</h2>\n<p>Leacim takes delight in angering the other @UUID[JournalEntry.QlctNkzE9injOde9.JournalEntryPage.8HyVcZ70eyhwNJsu]{Drow} gods at every opportunity; his followers may substitute Leacim as the required diety for any item, class, feat or spell that has a drow deity requirement and may select the Drow domain if they have access to domains. Moreover, he often creates his own agents of changeâplayers that wish to play a drow of good alignment in a place that would otherwise prohibit that choice may choose Leacim as their deity to avoid that caveat.</p>\n<h2>Appearance</h2>\n<p>The trickster god has numerous guises but he most commonly appears as an affably dressed male half-drow with an alluring grin or a blonde human girl, regardless of form, both have piercing blue eyes. Leacimâs clothing is generally fashionable and appropriate for the environment, though it is sometimes slightly tattered and seemingly in a state of disrepair. He casually saunters seemingly without a care in the world, a scimitar on his side and a black-lacquered short bow across his back, in the female form he carries only a single knife as a weapon which always returns to him when thrown.</p>\n<h2>Shrines to the Trickster</h2>\n<p>Leacim doesnât have proper churchesâeffigies and the like are hidden in plain sight or are places of secret pilgrimage. These shrines are often made to look like they belong to other deities, and only show their true forms when the correct prayers are uttered. Followers that fail a DC 28 Knowledge (religion) check find their god distempered with them after praying at one of these shrines, though they remain unsure as to why (regardless of any divination spells they cast).</p>\n<h2>Holy Text</h2>\n<p>Leacimâs Lexicon is a treasured tome among thievesâ guilds, hidden drow enclaves and the trickster godâs followers. These books appear as unremarkable journals of unremarkable lives to followers of other deities (DC 26 Wisdom saving throw to negate) but in the hands of a devoted acolyte, provide a means to learn any rogue trick, illusion spell, or access to knowledge of prestige classes that require sneak attack as a prerequisite.</p>\n<h2>The Vast Swamp</h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:Signika, sans-serif\">Leahcim has taken root in the @UUID[JournalEntry.g4odaMsHbRkeNFhn]{Vast Swamp}, his trickster ways helping some daredevil rogues on their quest to lessen the burden of treasure on the vile dragons. It must be added that the tales of the rogues have become known but so far none have surfaced to verify these claims. Recently some inhabitants in the marshes have voiced their concernsâthat these rumors are merely planted by Leahcim himself for some unknown reasonâbut the trickster god has plans and schemes no mere mortal can hope to discern.</span></p>\n</div>","markdown":""},"_id":"2MMXPI4kINBOYNOP","image":{},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"sort":1200000,"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"JournalEntry.fAaBvRaalStVHLAa.JournalEntryPage.CYEQQN8Bs7oSr3YE"}}},{"name":"MustaâVohi","type":"text","title":{"show":false,"level":1},"text":{"format":1,"content":"<div class=\"aventyr\"><p class=\"s5\">MustaâVohi</p><p><strong>Titles: </strong>God Mother, Heavenly Concubine</p><p><strong>Homel: </strong>Everywhere</p><p><strong>Symbol: </strong>A goatâs head painted black</p><p><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary)\"><strong style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">Alignment: </strong>NE</span></p><p><strong>Portfolio: </strong>Birth, Health, Motherhood, Lust, Pregnancy</p><p><strong>Domains: </strong>Charm, Darkness, Healing, Protection</p><p><strong>Favoured</strong> <strong>Weapon:</strong> Spiked chain</p><p>Â </p><h2>History</h2><p>According to the @UUID[JournalEntry.dHHrcptCELfN05gb.JournalEntryPage.Tc1kTiX3bvQt4Jd7]{Yerek}, MustaâVohi created the universe from the sheer will to reproduce.

This light both warmed the cosmos and struck out against the darkness that also appeared. This light, both protective and aggressive is embodied in Naneth. She is both Leaf Mother and Warrior Mother.</p>\n<p>Â  Â Naneth (NAH neth), her sister @UUID[.leuKpASroHy7r6sn]{Naraneus}, and their brother @UUID[.zNH5DtHDKD52Ufaf]{Onael} created the first elves. Naneth comforted and warmed the elves, but she also taught them to defend themselves. She showed them to care for each other and themselves, but they only had each other to rely on. As the elves evolved, she became more of a mothering figure to them, offsetting the chaotic presence of Naraneus, while Onael drifted away from the family.</p>\n<p>Â  Â  Eventually, Naraneus became jealous of Nanethâs mothering ways and began a feud between the two that would last for ages and eventually encompass the elves as well, two groups choosing a deity to follow. Naraneus lost and the elves that followed her were banished from Edhellond.</p>\n<p>Â  Â  Once the war was over, Naneth reflected on Naraneusâs deceit. She decided that if she could not trust her own sister, her children couldnât trust anyone else. She instructed the Matriarch to retreat completely within @UUID[JournalEntry.wVQiwLZtRuaqbpFA]{Edhellond, the Silent Forest}.</p>\n<p>Â  Â  Trade relations with the other races suddenly ceased and there was no response from envoys sent to the elves. The entire elven society retreated into Edhellond, turning entirely to hunting, agriculture, and magic; forsaking any trade or relations with other races.</p>\n<p>Â  Â Naneth taught the elves that they were to rely only on themselves for everything. There would be no trade, no exchanges of information, no envoys allowed inside Edhellond and only those on secret missions benefiting elvish society were allowed to venture out from Edhellond.</p>\n<h2>Appearance</h2>\n<p>Naneth appears in two forms, befitting her dual nature. In her Asaya Naneth (Leaf Mother) form, she appears as a motherly female Elf, with long golden hair that reaches the ground and she always carries a basket of bright blue flowers. In her Maethor Naneth (Warrior Mother) guise, she appears as a tall, stout elf, dressed in leather armour and a small cap keeping her jet black hair out of the way. Regardless of how she dresses, she has a pin of her symbol at the neck of her garment. She always carries a shield that is designed to look like her symbol.</p>\n<p>Â  Â  She can change between the two forms in the blink of an eye.</p>\n<h2>Church of Naneth</h2>\n<p>Nanethâs âchurchâ is more of an outdoor shrine at the largest maple tree in the Silent Forest, Tal. Edhellond is a theocracy, led by the current Matriarch or Patriarch, who also leads the services to Naneth.</p>\n<h2>Worshippers and Clergy</h2>\n<p>All surface elves worship Naneth in either of her two forms and worship of both is the norm. Clergy outside of the Matriarch/Patriarch and the Cleric of Naneth selected by the ruler are treated equally regardless of power level or ability. The motto of the clergy is âWe only have ourselvesâ so they do not discriminate in any way.</p>\n<h2>Holy Text</h2>\n<p>The Triploid Text: This tome is separated into sections of three, with each section beginning with a parable of Asaya Naneth, ending with a parable of Maethon Naneth, and the middle section being descriptions of the war between the elves and between Naneth and @UUID[.leuKpASroHy7r6sn]{Naraneus}.</p>\n<p>The cover of the copy that belongs to the Matriarch or Patriarch is created from several massive maple leaves.

Others claim it is the essence of the Honningsop Mushroom, the oldest living thing on the planet, elevated to godhood from the residual divine energies wrought throughout history. Its awakening may not have been caused by the pantheonâs doings, but its emergence seems to coincide with The Grand Sculpting and the Great Schism.</p>\n<p>As the endless caves of the Underworld expanded, vast chambers filled with moisture risen from tunnels hundreds of miles away, creating damp caverns of moist earth. The Natural Force seeded the subterranean breezes with its spores, creating the mushroom jungles and fungal forests of Aventyr. More than that, some of these spores carried the very children of the deityâintelligent, benevolent plant humanoids known as @UUID[JournalEntry.QlctNkzE9injOde9.JournalEntryPage.yv3q3b1HnUnZB2OT]{Funglet}.</p>\n<p>The divine beings of Aventyr generally regard the great nature deity of the Underworld with a measure of respect, if they acknowledge it at all. It answers the calls of its followers but is remarkably slow to act openly, playing the great game of the gods with a level of detachment and planning that no other deity can fathom.</p>\n<h2>Appearance</h2>\n<p>When the Natural Force does appear (which is extremely rare), it does so as a @UUID[JournalEntry.QlctNkzE9injOde9.JournalEntryPage.yv3q3b1HnUnZB2OT]{Funglet} of enormous height, colored in a kaleidoscopic mixture of all the different subtypes and carrying a gigantic club made from a fantafungi. Every patch of earth the Natural Force touches erupts with a random assortment of mushrooms immediately after he breaks contact with it, and all naturally grown barriers part their way for it and take no damage from its passing.</p>\n<h2>Church of the Natural Force</h2>\n<p>Any monument or sculpture of a mushroom serves as a shrine to the Natural Force, though acolytes of the nature deity pray to fungus of large size or greater if they are able to. Sites of particular religious significance always bear an importance to the number three, though none are sure why (save the Natural Force and its wisest adherents, though they have never revealed it).</p>\n<h2>Holy Text</h2>\n<p>The Libre Boletus is a tome crafted from boletann pages. Anyone that casually skims the book sees nothing but simple gardening tips to encourage the growth of mushrooms, but should they read it fully through, the pages transform to explain the tenets of the Natural Forceâs faith. Carefully absorbing the contents of the tome (requiring 24 hours of reading) teaches the reader the rituals necessary to work and craft boletann.</p>\n<h2>The Vast Swamp</h2>\n<p>The Natural Force is worshiped throughout the Vast Swamp by druids and shamans of the various tribes that inhabit the area. While this mysterious entity has always been worshipped on varying scales throughout history, recently there has been a surge in followers as an unexplained patch of mushrooms not native to the swamp recently flourished in the @UUID[JournalEntry.g4odaMsHbRkeNFhn.JournalEntryPage.oIbJsrbNZu7GVWp9#the-jagged-coast]{The Jagged Coast} area, inexplicably resisting all attempts by @UUID[JournalEntry.g4odaMsHbRkeNFhn.JournalEntryPage.JuqcYkrHQOMobwTy#dreivantix]{Dreivantix} to destroy it.

Her hair is also white and made of tiny spiders constantly moving in a crawling and disorienting fashion.

Together, they created the beings that would become knows at elves. @UUID[.oyFVdicDq8mbjOWw]{Naneth} provided the loving and mothering aspect. She showed them how to care for and protect each other, teaching them skills they needed to survive. @UUID[.leuKpASroHy7r6sn]{Naraneus} provided the chaos that seemed to pervade this new world and taught the elves about death and destruction and how to kill for food. Onael provided the controlling aspect, teaching the elves that in order to succeed, in spite of the chaos, there needed to be order and control. He taught them leadership and command and that of all the newly formed races, the elves were the greatest of them all.</p><p>Â  Â  Eventually, over the millennia, the elves evolved away from the controlled savagery and into the form that is more common today. As the world became more ordered, they needed their aggression less and opened themselves up more to the life and magic that surrounded them. Without as much violence, they began to live longer and grew smaller, as their muscles were not needed as much for combat. They understood that they did not need to conquer and control to live in the modern world and accepted their place, arriving in @UUID[JournalEntry.wVQiwLZtRuaqbpFA]{Edhellond}, the Elven land that would become known as the Silent Forest.</p><p>Â  Â Onael did not understand. He thought he had taught them correctly. Seeing that the elves had turned their back on him, he took what he considered his âchildren,â the Edheliast, and retreated from the world to the Forgotten Forest, a demiplane that he considered his home.</p><p>Â  Â  In the Forgotten Forest, the Edheliast continue to fight for survival, growing bigger, stronger, faster, and more cunning. They fight against animals, magical beasts, and even the souls of dead elves and drow that Onael claims before @UUID[.oyFVdicDq8mbjOWw]{Naneth} or @UUID[.leuKpASroHy7r6sn]{Naraneus} can.</p><p>Â  Â  Recently, Onael has begun work to reclaim the elves as his own. He has many Edheliast to fight for him and he has created a new beast that will surely be a surprise to the elves.</p><h2>Appearance</h2><p>Onael appears as an Elf of immense size. He stands close to fifteen feet tall and is very heavily muscled. His dark hair is close cropped and shows off a widowâs peak. He is dressed conservatively, wearing only a black tunic with his symbol on the left breast, black pants, and black boots. On his left hip rest his longsword Coiasan.</p><p>Â Images of @UUID[.oyFVdicDq8mbjOWw]{Naneth}, @UUID[.leuKpASroHy7r6sn]{Naraneus}, and Onael show that there is a sibling similarity between the three, but Onael claims that he has no sisters.</p><h2>Church</h2><p>There is no church of Onael. There are no services or high priests, only combat. The Edheliant serve Onael by fighting and honing their skills.</p><h2>Worshippers and Clergy</h2><p>Every Edheliant worships Onael in trials by combat. The Edheliant dedicate every battle they participate in to Onaelâs glory and ask for him to fill their bodies with power to crush their enemies.</p><p>Â  Â There is no church hierarchy. Those that Onael graces with the merest fraction of his power use the spells granted to them to enhance the combat abilities of their comrades and themselves. Onaelâs clerics call themselves âSword Armsâ and mostly use spells that increase Strength or Constitution but will also make liberal use of Cure spells and Channeling Energy (if Neutral) to make sure they and their comrades can continue fighting.</p><h2>Holy Text</h2><p>None, although any manual that teaches someone a new fighting technique or improves on an existing technique are considered sacred and are kept in a âlibraryâ in the middle of the Forgotten Forest.</p><p>Â This library is really just many piles of books collected from different planes and realms and every book in the collection deals with some sort of combat.

In the time after the Sun Lord brought the warming of the land, Storjeger led numerous hunts into the forest where they killed many animals. In the bounty that was the land warming, they hadnât realized that they had over-hunted, leaving the land unbalanced. This led to a lack of game when the land began to cool after the Sun Lordâs death.</p><p>Â  Â  Â  As the tribe began to dwindle due to lack of food in the harsh winter, Storjeger, as thin as the rest of the tribe, went into the forest alone to find what food he could. After several hours, he spotted a large stag with an impressive rack of horns. Sneaking as close as he dared, his hands trembling from hunger, he threw his javelin. It missed badly, but instead of rushing into the woods, the deer turned and looked at Storjeger.</p><p>Â  Â  The stag turned and walked slowly into the woods with Storjeger close behind. Following the deer for another hour, Storjeger had been led him to a place in the woods he had never been before. In the distance, he saw a herd of deer that numbered in the dozens with many calves. He prepared his javelin, but the deer he had followed looked at him and then knelt down, laying down its head. It was joined by three does, each kneeling down and offering their necks to Storjeger.</p><p>Â  Â  Storjeger drew his knife and offering thanks to the deer for their sacrifice, killed the four. He took a few small pieces of meat for himself to sustain him for the trip back. He produced a large sack and bundled the three deer into it and tied the bag to his belt. The stag, he hefted onto his shoulders as a sign of respect.</p><p>Â  Â  Â He made the walk back to the Skykosh tribe with tears in his eyes as he knew he could provide for his people. On the trip back, Storjeger realized that his people had to live in balance with the animals of the forest in order to make sure this didnât happen again. As it was partly his fault that the tribe was in such a predicament, Storjeger was determined to protect the balance of the forest.</p><p>Â  Â  Â Upon returning to his tribe, he delivered the deer and explained what had happened and what he had seen and the understanding of the balance. He took the head of the stag and created a mask from it and made a coat from the skin. Without another word, Storjeger walked out of the village and into the realm of the gods, making the name Storjeger synonymous with survival and donning the mantle of God of the Hunt.</p><p>Â  Â  Storjeger (STOR jay ger) almost always appears as a giant elk but sometimes manifests as a thin warrior of medium height with a stagâs head and horns. He carries several javelin on his back, a longbow made from Yggdrasil, and three arrows, each unique and powerful.</p><p>Â  Â  Â  Storjeger was originally worshipped only by the @UUID[JournalEntry.QlctNkzE9injOde9.JournalEntryPage.I4CpK8rTs0HgD7hW]{Vikmordere}, but in a very brief period before the @UUID[JournalEntry.QlctNkzE9injOde9.JournalEntryPage.DXD1ygEckY0JIUFB]{Klavekians} went to war with the Vikmordere, there was an exchange of information, including the tale of Storjeger.

Unaware of her true power and acting only of universal impulse, Vasi embraced earth, fire, and air, to create Aventyr itself, and through this formation, the freshwater with which to rain down and cover the world. While others would end up as caretakers over the brackish depths where earth and water bled too deeply together, Vasi was the guardian of it all.Â Â </p>\n<p>Â  Â  After she adopted to the needs of those mortals living in Aventyr, and after the Shard of the Sun nearly collided with the planet, Vasi took to caring for those lacking water, sending her clergy into the Scorched Lands to find, save, and possibly convert those who would surely have died in the desert wastes.Â Â </p>\n<h2>Churches, Clergy, and Worshippers</h2>\n<p>Vasiâs shrines and temples are found near deep grottos and remote mountain lakes, anywhere there is a clean source of freshwater, a small shrine is found nearby.

More than a physical being, as the insectoids came to dominate the planet of the alien godâs origin, Zagnexis manifested as the congealed consciousness of their dead. While the other intelligent lifeforms on that world fought valiantly, with a deific being directing the racial hive mind of the @UUID[JournalEntry.QlctNkzE9injOde9.JournalEntryPage.SGw7zGFtvjLNPDMY]{hoyrall}, they quickly came to rule over all that the insect god could perceive.</p>\n<p>Â Until the Great Schism. The progenitors, cast down from their once mythic forms into the lowly race now known as the draaki, made a desperate cry to the cosmos and it was Zagnexis that answered their plea. Mustering the unimaginable power granted from the complete devotion of an entire race of creatures, the insect god transported his entire physical form into AventyrâZagn, along with tens of thousands of hoyrallâdirectly across the universe and into the Dracoprimeâs skull, killing the draconic monstrosity instantly.</p>\n<p>Â  Â  For some generations, Exis continued to direct its children on Aventyr, growing a massive army within the fortress-hives of the hoyrall in preparation for an all-out assault to conquer both the surface and the Underworld. Were it not for the intervention of the colloid during The Confluence, it surely would have succeeded. The other alien entity seized upon Exis conduit to its children, breaking the hive mind of the hoyrall and sending its physical counterpart, Zagn, careening into the oceans of Aventyr to wreck havoc upon everything it meets.</p>\n<p>Â  Â  Since then, Exis has retained what connections it can to Aventyr, granting powers to its clerics and oracles but little more. The alien god wants nothing more than to expand and procreate, increasing its deific power by generating a second world of followers. Exis is avaricious and without regard for the general balance of natural powers; it will stop at nothing to re-establish its hold over both Zagn and the hoyrall before consuming all of Aventyr.</p>\n<h2>Appearance</h2>\n<p>Exis is a spectral insect composed of dozens of different arthropods, its countless limbs, heads, eyes and antennae constantly morphing into new shapes or variations. Zagn is an enormous, multi-headed (and multi-mouthed) segmented worm with thousands upon thousands of legs that span a body measured by miles.</p>\n<h2>Church of Zagnexis</h2>\n<p>Temples, churches and shrines devoted to the alien god are commonly found throughout the fortress-hives of the hoyrall and honeycombed into Upperworld mountains, but most are in terrible states of disrepair. The unrest following The Confluence led to the dissolution of hoyrall society, and the sites of worship to the god that once bound them all together were quickly targeted by dissenters and never-do-wells. New churches to Zagnexis are well-appointed and carefully kept, tiled with the carapace of insects in exquisite mosaics that depict the journey of the hoyrall.</p>\n<h2>Holy Text</h2>\n<p>There is no written or oral tradition to the worship of Zagnexis; lesser followers are taught the rites of worship through nonverbal communication (through limbs or antennae), and acolytes meld their minds with greater priests in ritual-driven meldings of the minds. Only this devout form of communication is fit for the transmission of the holiest information known to the worshippers of the insect god.</p>\n<p>Â </p>\n<p>Â </p>\n</div>","markdown":""},"_id":"BgaAYMVXk3L6daU4","image":{},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"sort":2200000,"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"JournalEntry.1nhWSRlTjP4u99gB.JournalEntryPage.vHtchpvGcDlwG7Ja"}}},{"sort":2150000,"name":"Xio","type":"text","_id":"o7Bl7XnxenERvjAq","title":{"show":false,"level":1},"image":{},"text":{"format":1,"content":"<div class=\"aventyr\"><p class=\"s5\">Xio</p><p><strong>Titles:</strong> The Eternal Combatant, Captain of Captains, The Blood Rage</p><p><strong>Home:</strong> Valhalla</p><p><strong>Symbol:</strong> A star crafted from five crossed swords surrounding a bleached skull</p><p><strong>Alignment:</strong> NE</p><p><strong>Portfolio:</strong> Bravery, Combat, War</p><p><strong>Domains:</strong> Destruction, Ferocity, Honor, Strength, War</p><p><strong>Favored Weapon:</strong> Warhammer and handaxe</p><p>Xio is the deity of battle, both honorable and otherwise; he goes wherever there is war or brings it to lands where it is not, ensuring constant and glorious battle.</p><h2>History</h2><p>None truly know when Xio came into existence, but it is said that as long as there has been conflict, he has been amongst those who fight.

As their understanding increases, they add additional domains to their repertoire of gifts from the goddess.</p><p><strong>Role:</strong> A Devotee of the Four Hearts is more prepared to deal with elemental challenges than her less erudite brothers and sisters.

The reason for the visit was that Mentane thought he had found a way to become a god. His hypothesis was that if he could instill the magical essences that he acquired daily into the same place for a long period of time, then the release of that pent up energy into himself would push him past the boundary of mortality and into the realm of godhood. Mentane chose a small fuzzy fruit with a green interior, called a forhoral, which grew on a vine as his receptacle of power.</p><p>As they settled on the eastern edge of the forest Golar began to notice the large numbers of primates in the forest. Ignoring them, Mentane had Golar find a piece of wood to allow the vines of the fruit grow upward.</p><p>For the next year, every morning, Mentane would slowly and carefully direct his magical energies into the seed that he had planted. Golar, not being needed, wandered the forest. Some of the primates took interest in the two for a while, but seeing that they were no immediate threat, they were content to ignore the two.</p><p>After about a month, one small chimpanzee began following the Golar as he explored what would become known as Treeland. He began to call her âQathindli,â which translated roughly to âsmall oneâ in his local Orcish dialect. He would call and wave to her every morning and she would chatter back at him.</p><p>Something surprising that Golar noticed was that Qathindli would watch him when he went through his morning exercises. She would sit on a branch and stare at him while he moved in slow, deliberate patterns. She had taken a special liking to his three-bladed boomerang. When she wasnât watching him practice, he would almost always find her at his pack, holding the throwing weapon. Eventually, he carved her her own two-bladed boomerang and placed a leather strap around the two ends. She took it with her everywhere.</p><p>As the year progressed, Mentaneâs fruit began to grow, becoming larger than usual for this type of fruit. The vine grew quickly up the post and one year to the day of its planting, Mentane emerged from his tent, ready to become a god.</p><p>His forhoral fruit was gone. In its place, he found Qathindli sitting on the forest floor, holding the remains of the forhoral fruit.</p><p>She sat and stared, her monkey mind not comprehending what was happening to her.</p><p>Mentane began ranting and raving about the amount of effort he put into the project and his loss to a monkey. In his rage, he was preparing to utterly destroy Qathindli when she turned her head toward him and shocked both he and Golar.</p><p>âWhat is happening to me?â she asked loudly and haltingly.</p><p>All three stared at each other for a moment before Qathindli screeched and ran off into the forest.</p><p>A few days later, Mentane packed up his belongings and stowed them on the boat. He was going to make his way back to the @UUID[JournalEntry.QVrlu0lTv2vFtT5P]{Klavek Kingdom}. Golar said that he was going to stay in the forest for the time being. They bade each other farewell and Golar watched Mentane sail off into the sunrise.</p><p>Golar found Qathindli her near her tribe of monkeys. She was speaking quickly and erratically, words from every language spilling out of her mouth. Golar understood words from a few languages and recognized several more. The other monkeys were frightened of her.</p><p>Using food, Golar tempted Qathindli out of her tree and through a long and arduous process, explained what Mentane had done with the forhoral fruit and that his best guess was that when she had eaten the fruit, she had absorbed all of the magical power invested in it and that she had become more than a monkey.</p><p>Over the course of the next six months, Golar taught Qathindli control thanks to his martial training. While she did learn how to focus her newly found thoughts, she was still a monkey inside. Her train of thought often derailed into a conglomeration of words from different languages, which made it difficult for Golar to understand.</p><p>The change in her standing among the primates came when, as she and Golar were training in a small clearing, a wild boar broke through the undergrowth and charged at Golar. Though the battle was brief, it was also incredibly violent. In the end, the boar lay dead and Golar had numerous cuts and slashes from the boarâs wicked tusks. Qathindli rushed out from her hiding place and chattered at Golar in numerous languages as he started to succumb to his injuries. As he tumbled to the ground, Qathindli placed her hands on him and with a visible light, poured healing energy into Golar.</p><p>The forest around the two of them went silent as the watchful monkeys around them looked on and saw the power that Qathindli now possessed.</p><p>While she may not have been a demigoddess in the classical sense, Qathindli has eclipsed monkeyhood and is something more. She had decided to be the protector of Treeland, which she named herself. When she accepted that mantle, she became a demigoddess.</p><h2>Appearance</h2><p>Qathindli can change her appearance to that of any primate in existence, except human. Her preferred form is a pygmy monkey that stands roughly six inches tall, with bright red hair. This form seems to cause less violent reactions in those that she speaks with than one of her larger shapes.</p><p>Each of her forms has a face that is like the race she is interacting with than it is monkey-like.</p><h2>Church</h2><p>Even though she doesnât understand it, the humans that live in @UUID[JournalEntry.dHHrcptCELfN05gb.JournalEntryPage.eOVkEXkbiSWbkVcp#treeland]{Treeland} worship Qathindli. The services are held outside usually around midday, but it varies due to the weather.</p><p>The leader of the humans, Damon, teaches that the people of his tribe should live like the monkeys: in harmony with nature. Because of his worship, Qathindli grants him spells, even if she doesnât know how she does that.</p><h2>Worshippers &amp; Clergy</h2><p>Qathindiâs worshippers are all of the humans that live in Treeland, under the guidance of her only clergy member, @UUID[JournalEntry.dHHrcptCELfN05gb.JournalEntryPage.Tc1kTiX3bvQt4Jd7#damon]{Damon}. One of the titles Damon has given Qathindli is âThe Unsullied.â He believes that she is holy because she has never been human, and therefore is above us and unsullied by her nature.</p><h2>Holy Text</h2><p>Qathindli has no holy text to speak of. As her knowledge of language grows, she has had Golar and Damon try to teach her how to write. The two main problems are that monkey hands are not designed for holding human writing utensils and Qathindli still has the mind of a monkey, so any given sentence contains multiple languages and bad translations, making them impossible to read. Damon still collects these âwritingsâ and keeps them safe.</p></div>","markdown":""},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}}],"_stats":{"systemId":"dnd5e","systemVersion":"2.1.2","coreVersion":"10.291","createdTime":1662054505131,"modifiedTime":1674301334112,"lastModifiedBy":"EsIYTtNnjwxUbKOG"},"ownership":{"default":0,"R5IsvMTH5P79pBoG":3},"folder":"j9cXBagzZ1ARsO2I","sort":1000000},{"name":"Races of Aventyr","pages":[{"name":"Elves","type":"text","title":{"show":false,"level":2},"text":{"format":1,"content":"<div class=\"aventyr\">\n<p class=\"s5\">Elves</p>\n<p>Â </p>\n<p>Â </p>\n<img style=\"margin:0px 15px 15px 0px;border:0px;float:right\" src=\"modules/aaw-games-aventyr/Races-Images/Elf-of-Silent-Forest.webp\" width=\"255\" height=\"363\" />\n<p><em>Elves in human lands are generally considered spies, and looked upon with great suspicion.

A hero may be the exception to the rule, but will never let other races know the secrets of their homeland. Elves live for thousands of years and have an inner-wisdom of the natural world that humans will never attain. They are aloof and secretive and generally keep to themselves. The majority of elves live within the protective confines of the @UUID[JournalEntry.wVQiwLZtRuaqbpFA]{Silent Forest} to the south of the @UUID[JournalEntry.QVrlu0lTv2vFtT5P]{Klavek Kingdom}. The Silent Forest is a magical place where humans are forbidden, and those who have ventured into the forest never return.

The elvesâ love of nature is always paramount and the reason why they are truly working with them is to see that the business does not damage the ecosystem of the swamp.

Large portions of their island home of @UUID[JournalEntry.PCe82J4UbHQWFYYL]{Picollo} far to the southeast remain uninhabited.

Halflings from exiled backgrounds are more likely to be trusting of non-halflings and tend to hold more true to the ancient ways and happy-go-lucky traditions of halfling society. Those whose families suffered during the @UUID[.SGw7zGFtvjLNPDMY]{Hoyrall} Wars and enslavement are more prone to pragmatism. This practical outlook has begun to erode the traditional paths of fellowship and community. Though fragile, a bond does still remain between all halflings; it is taboo for one halfling to kill another even under dire circumstances; those that do face banishment. When banding together in groups halflings are a force to be reckoned with.</p>\n<h2>Vast Swamp</h2>\n<p>Halflings are often called upon when the Black Gold Consortium needs something done in a tight spot. Small folk can often find employment cleaning or fixing in-between the cogs of extraction centers, or removing blockages in tall chimneys or long pipes; the work is always dangerous, so they expect to be paid well. The Neliton family is one of the core families in the consortium and in charge of halfling relations in @UUID[JournalEntry.g4odaMsHbRkeNFhn.JournalEntryPage.Tdkqx23iD22AVlLv]{Cherrianâs Rest}. The familyâs easy going nature has protected them from the internal conflicts of the consortiumâthey love to show off their strong sense of fashion. The Nelitons are the trendsetting family of the Consortium, often wearing the finest garments and jewels just to show off their lavishness and to invoke the jealousy of the other families.</p>\n<h2>Subtypes</h2>\n<h3>Seaborn</h3>\n<p>Most of the of the archipelago that made up greater @UUID[JournalEntry.PCe82J4UbHQWFYYL]{Picollo}was buried under the sea when the Dracoprime fell in the Great Schism, but scattered isles remain. Some halflings spend their whole lives on ships traveling between these isles, mainland Picollo, and the rest of Aventyr. While they feel bonds of kinship to all halflings, their ties to their shipmates are the closest. Years of fighting wind and wave have taught them caution, and that discretion is often the better part of valor.</p>\n<h3>Highlanders</h3>\n<p>On the @UUID[JournalEntry.PCe82J4UbHQWFYYL.JournalEntryPage.Gv1vyttllOYQaK2t#the-great-mountain]{The Great Mountain}, the highland halflings were in the thickest fighting during the @UUID[.SGw7zGFtvjLNPDMY]{Hoyrall} Wars as the insect-like race spewed forth from the tunnels and chambers riddling the great peak. Alliances with the @UUID[.RTYoyteEKY7EOhy2]{dweorg} at the base of the mountain and the @UUID[.MsDyrandNiqdPIrd]{zwerc} its top provided arms and armor and magic during the struggle, and often a place of retreat.</p>\n<h3>Tree-Borers</h3>\n<p>These halfling clans live alongside the fey in @UUID[JournalEntry.PCe82J4UbHQWFYYL.JournalEntryPage.Gv1vyttllOYQaK2t#the-great-forest]{the great forest of Picollo}.

Endless pranks and tricks played on the halflings by their fey neighbors often have them cursing their luck.

The village of Rybalka also works a local iron mine which supplied ore for the Vikmordere weapons and shipbuilding tools.</p>\n<p>Â  The Klavek Kingdom Monarchy moved troops into the Vikmordere Valley and launched an arduous assault against the Vikmordere in hopes of securing this strategic location and obtaining the lucrative iron mine. After many failed attempts and the death of hundreds of Klavekian ground troops, the Klavek Kingdom was finally able to oust the Vikmordere raiders and take over the small village and local mine.

The limited time available to the undead wizard prevented wide dispersal of the anti-colloid virus, leaving the extraterrestrial sentience puzzled by how any creature can resist its psyche (there is a 1% chance that a PC has been exposed to this otherwise benign virus and is immune to the detrimental effects of the colloid).

They stayed deep beneath the world toiling in their greatest cities, only an echo of their former selves.</p>\n<p><strong>The third </strong>were named the @UUID[.MsDyrandNiqdPIrd]{Zwerc}, created from the spirits of the Dvergr. This granted them innate power over magic, their mystical nature making them loners and travelers with an endless thirst for knowledge.</p>\n<p>Â </p>\n<p>The potent avarice of the Dvergr, however, would not be undone by the godsâtraveling far from the deific crafting, the very essence of their greed delved deep into Aventyr, much deeper than the gods had permitted the Dvergr to go. Soon they had discovered HELâwhere devils and demons dwellâand while the first three races were created, a pact was forged with the denizens there. The devils granted the Dvergrâs avarice physical form and realms in the deepest, most foul and flaming depths of the Underworldâbut they did not stop there. The devils gave the @UUID[.Atn2VIF5a1D1uJUZ]{Gitwerc} the ability to siphon souls from the other races to feed themselves, and in turn they granted the Gitwerc more power.</p>\n<p>Â </p>\n<p>When the gods returned to forge the fourth, they found the Dvergrâs entrails snatched up by devils who had turned them into a terrible creature, the Gitwerc.</p>\n<p>Â </p>\n<p>The gods, realizing their mistake in creating a race with no evil intent, vowed never to do so again and went to work creating the fifth race in secret, using all the remaining parts of the Dvergr. The fifth and final race would be eloquent, honorable, knowledgeable, and nearly immortal, yet the race would be forever divided, torn between light and darkness. Their souls were permanently bound to the world, sentenced with a nearly endless life staring out upon the sea of eternity, never able to attain that balance which comes so easy to the other races. The gods placed this race above and below the world, both in light and in darkness; they became the @UUID[.ei36LjIhEoh87vgE]{Elves} and the @UUID[.8HyVcZ70eyhwNJsu]{Drow}.</p>\n<p>Â  Â  Â Then the gods did something which surprised all of the races.
