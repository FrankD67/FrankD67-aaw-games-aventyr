A forest exists whether the party is there or not and, therefore, has a life of its own. It is full of animals, creatures both mundane and fanciful, areas of magic and mystery, and places with history.</p>\n<p>People have been through this forest before your party, and some may still be in the area. People drop the oddest things in forests.</p>\n<p>In your game, you can break up the monotony of forest terrain travel with some of these items.

Most frequently this is during war, where neither the unhelpful morality of good and evil nor the confusion and disorder of chaos allow for clear decisions to be made and victory achieved. The Axiomatic General appears wherever clear-thinking, considered tactics, and balanced plans are being prepared or followed. While the field of war is the usual site for these activities, the Axiomatic General has been known to appear during complicated but emotionless court cases, and sometimes even when the cold, detached clarity of true monkish enlightenment is reached.</p>\n<p>The Axiomatic General is neither male nor female, instead being a creature devoid of physically distracting bias. It can appear as a female or male of any humanoid species, whichever form is most likely to aid with clarity of decision making.</p>\n<h2>Dogma</h2>\n<p>The Axiomatic General and its followers wish to bring the clarity of law to those places that currently live in emotional turmoil and to demonstrate to all the axiomatic nature of law when applied to war, legal frameworks, and personal actions. It expects its believers to instigate and adhere to meaningful laws while at the same time exposing and amending those which are ludicrous, outlandish, convoluted, unenforceable, or contrary. The Overseer of War abhors any decision or process that allows an individual to take unfair advantage of another, either through methods such as emotional blackmail, the abuse of personal power, or as a result of chance. It encourages its followers to engage in long-term ordered “wars” rather than short-and-sharp fights—the chaos of battle is well known, but by carefully considering one’s options, testing one’s theories, and then following through with a well-conceived plan, one can make their way to victory in an ordered manner. If all around them are clear about their intentions, one can see their actions are as fair and just as possible, and that trade and public prosperity, the courts, and the growth of society as a whole can continue during even the greatest of conflicts.</p>\n<p>The Lord of All Wars promotes careful consideration in all matters and expects its followers to be able to provide self-evident truths for all their actions. Haste, guesswork, and self-indulgence lead to reliance on emotion and base, uncontrolled actions. It disapproves of reliance on government or any religious institution that fosters blind trust or, even worse, unprovable belief, explaining that those with sound judgement, mental discipline, and an unshakeable grasp of sensible, irrefutable laws can overcome the inauthentic evidence and invalid arguments of the emotional and chaotic masses.</p>\n<h2>History</h2>\n<p>Once a mortal humanoid, the Axiomatic General ascended to become deified, although it is unclear what exactly it once was as virtually all races have a legendary historical figure that has risen from the mortal ranks to those of the divine after following the path of a great warrior who tirelessly supported its deity. What is evident is that the Overseer of War became more powerful than this original deity and ended up judging it at the culmination of a long conflict. The Lord of All War’s final verdict and victory provided the energy and evidence needed for the warrior to rise to godhood itself.</p>\n<p>The Axiomatic General tends to appear in history (as the simple warrior of its humanoid type) when the race’s pre-eminent lawful deity first wages war against more than one non-lawful foe, whether they be good, evil, or chaotic. It goes by many titles (a few of which appear above) but always has the ability to make clear, concise, and entirely accurate decisions even in the heat and fog of combat. Tales invariably tell of the Overseer of War having to uphold the lawful aims and ambitions of another deity’s followers when the god or goddess itself proves to be weak and fallible. Then the Axiomatic General steps in to save those same worshipers before judging the god in question and finding it wanting. After this, it takes the fight to the enemy, turns the tide of the war with unquestionable judgement, and becomes a deity in its own right. After this, the Lord of All Wars is always found leading those who know its words to be the truth through conflict, disagreement, and dispute—a reliable route to absolute, undeniable victory.</p>\n<h2>Relationships</h2>\n<p>The Overseer of War is entirely dismissive of any and all other deities that do not in some part embrace lawful beliefs. While those that promote chaos feel its full wrath, the Axiomatic General constantly seeks to disprove the tenets of neutral good and neutral evil deities because of their reliance on sentimental or self-centred emotions. It tolerates lawful good and lawful evil gods as long as their lawful nature is at the forefront of their actions, and is just as likely to support a lawfully-minded archon in a conflict against an evil devil as it is a lawfully-minded devil that wages war against an overly-good archon; ultimately, the balance of law is what is important.</p>\n<p>The Axiomatic General is opposed by all those who promote personal choice, uncontrolled actions, and “belief”—it is guaranteed to come into conflict with deities that support and nurture bards and barbarians, and frequently with those that nurture wild sorcerers. Because it is so closely linked with conclusive and categorical truth, the Lord of All Wars sometimes finds itself on the side of sages, experts, philosophers and academics that devote their lives to uncovering a lost or hidden truth, whether military, legal, commercial, or magical.</p>\n<h2>Appearance</h2>\n<p>The Axiomatic General usually appears as a healthy, vibrant member of the appropriate race and can be either female or male (or neither). Its clothing is always practical for the situation but is clearly designed to instil confidence and invariably a bright white. The god’s symbol, the decorated iron rod, is sewn into the space above the heart and mimicked by the weapon it wields. The Overseer of War always carries a +3 axiomatic brilliant energy light mace, the look and effect of which are in line with the main domain of the senior cleric in the vicinity as follows:</p>\n<table style=\"float:left;width:99.5833%;height:113px\" border=\"1\">\n<tbody>\n<tr style=\"height:32.5px\">\n<td style=\"width:47.7664%;height:32.5px;background-color:#000000;border-color:#ffffff\">\n<h3><span style=\"color:#ffffff\"><strong>Domain</strong></span></h3>\n</td>\n<td style=\"width:52.2358%;height:32.5px;background-color:#000000;border-color:#ffffff\">\n<h3><span style=\"color:#ffffff\"><strong>Rod type</strong></span></h3>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height:20.125px\">\n<td style=\"width:47.7664%;height:20.125px;background-color:#ecf0f1;border-color:#000000\">Law</td>\n<td style=\"width:52.2358%;height:20.125px;background-color:#ecf0f1;border-color:#000000\">Alertness</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height:20.125px\">\n<td style=\"width:47.7664%;height:20.125px;background-color:#ecf0f1;border-color:#000000\">Nobility</td>\n<td style=\"width:52.2358%;height:20.125px;background-color:#ecf0f1;border-color:#000000\">Splendour</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height:20.125px\">\n<td style=\"width:47.7664%;height:20.125px;background-color:#ecf0f1;border-color:#000000\">Strength</td>\n<td style=\"width:52.2358%;height:20.125px;background-color:#ecf0f1;border-color:#000000\">Flailing</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height:20.125px\">\n<td style=\"width:47.7664%;height:20.125px;background-color:#ecf0f1;border-color:#000000\">War</td>\n<td style=\"width:52.2358%;height:20.125px;background-color:#ecf0f1;border-color:#000000\">Rulership</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>Legends dictate that the Axiomatic General occasionally appears as a fully advanced, adamantine-coated marut, but the last occasion this was recorded was many generations ago.</p>\n<h2>Providence</h2>\n<p>Followers and clergy of the Lord of All Wars know that clarity of planning, deeper understanding of the way forward, or insight into a problem that has been gained after careful thought and consideration has come from their deity. This knowledge doesn’t appear suddenly but is the reward for taking time and exploring all possibilities. The Oversee of War thinks highly of those who consider their options before acting decisively, as well as of those who follow through with long-term plans without faltering.</p>\n<p>Any sign of plans failing, the confusion reigning, or participants not understanding their role is seen as a sign that the Axiomatic General is displeased and expects greater discipline and forethought.</p>\n<h2>Servants</h2>\n<p>The Axiomatic General rewards those who organize well and keep to agreed plans, no matter how long this may take. These machinations often take many generations in the case of shorter-lived humanoids such as goblinoids and humans, or the entire life of the longest-living elves. Servants must be prepared to sacrifice the immediate for the longer term, understand that they may lose those around them today for the betterment of a lawful population tomorrow, and recognize that the needs of a lawful future outweigh any considerations here and now.</p>\n<p>The Overseer of War grants particular favour to those who constantly uphold the law—inevitables are viewed with esteem alongside formians and other hive-minded creatures. Followers that devote themselves to a lifetime of achieving a long-term lawful aim regularly receive insight and clarity from their god. Humanoids that either spend a significant portion of their time gaining greater insight into a particular path or are able to rapidly judge the features and benefits of a number of possibilities before quickly making the correct decision often gain a divine hint or two.</p>\n<h2>The Church of the Axiomatic General</h2>\n<p>Sites of worship to the Lord of All Wars serve one purpose: to ensure that correct decision are made to further indisputable truth. They range in size from an officer’s table in their tent, a simple sand tablet on which a cleric explains a truth, or in a lawyer’s or sage’s rooms, to the chambers of a country’s most magnificent courtroom, the order flags at the front line of the latest battle in a war, or the grandest library within the @UUID[JournalEntry.QVrlu0lTv2vFtT5P]{Klavek Kingdom} most spectacular cathedral to the Axiomatic General. Churches to this god are all simple, plain affairs that remove mental distraction and clutter at the same time as allowing axioms and tenets spoken by the Overseer of War to be spread effectively and efficiently.</p>\n<p>Worship of the Axiomatic General is frequently silent as followers consider practical issues at hand as well as long-term problems that require a more considered solution. Followers frequently engage in debates, most of which are serious but enjoyable affairs—there is no time for frivolous thought when the Lord of All War’s tenets are involved—although there is no sense of “victory or defeat” in these sessions (the aim is to reach the truest, most accurate solution to a question, and everybody learns something.) When necessary, churches of the Overseer of War provide a neutral meeting point between warring factions of good and evil, although only the most experienced and senior of clergy attempt to mediate between chaotic elements. The Axiomatic General has shown that the wisest course for followers of law is to work together to overcome chaos through any means possible before resolving philosophical and personal lawful differences using contemplation and debate.</p>\n<p>The clergy of the Overseer of War organize themselves in a clear and obvious hierarchy in the same way that any modern military, business, or courtroom would do. Similarly, religious and educational centres that follow the Axiomatic General have a plain structure in place that shows who has best demonstrated an understanding of the god’s aims and objectives. No matter where or how the Lord of All War is followed, its churches are defined by their grasp of unequivocal truths, unimpeachable laws, unbeatable tactics, and unquestionable enlightenment. Churches that exhibit knowledge over belief and can demonstrate undeniable evidence for these truths have the greatest standing, no matter what their size. Worshipers rise up the ranks in the same way: anyone who can establish irrefutable knowledge and information is given ever greater responsibilities. At the same time, mistakes aren’t considered a failure if the individuals concerned can show they did all they could to establish clarity and a considered answer. All they have to do is recognize that further investigation has produced better knowledge and make sure they don’t repeat the mistake. As the Lord of All Wars is happy to develop plans over many generations, errors that can be rectified bear little consequence.</p>\n<p>Churches worshipping the Axiomatic General are openly found in the centre of lawful societies and on the outskirts of those populations with no preference for law or chaos but are seemingly absent from chaotic cultures. The Overseer of War prefers his followers to surround such cultures and gradually move inwards until the chaos is crushed out of them—a process that takes as long as is necessary, designed to ensure no worshiper is tricked into joining chaos from within.</p>\n<p>Services to the Axiomatic General are ordered affairs, comprising either contemplation of the truth or respectful presentation of findings and subsequent decision-making they influence. In all situations, there is ample opportunity for everyone who wants to speak to do so, although followers recognize the need to act swiftly during war situations and develop a truncated, precise style of presenting their findings.</p>\n<h2>Worshipers</h2>\n<p>The Axiomatic General is primarily worshipped by military officers but also draws in judges, lawyers, barristers, sages, monks, and those who would advance society in an ordered and structured way. Those who indulge in chaotic thoughts and acts are ignored at all times.</p>\n<h2>Clergy</h2>\n<p>The clergy of the Overseer of War are not necessarily clerics, although if they aren’t they are only allowed to represent the god within their own sphere of expertise and influence (for example, military officers can only lead services and discussions about military matters). Any member of the clergy who is a cleric is required to lead a service in an overarching capacity even if the content is decided by the senior subject expert. In all situations, the most experience cleric leads a service, with assistance as appropriate from other members of the congregation.</p>\n<p>The Axiomatic General does not support paladins, despite their martial outlook. Their tendency towards good leads them to not always consider the balanced needs of a lawful life, which in turn means their judgment isn’t always going to be the best it can be in some situations.</p>\n<h2>Temples and Shrines</h2>\n<p>Buildings devoted to the Lord of All Wars are functional, unadorned, designed to serve all aspects of the god’s tenets, yet clearly focused on one domain more than others (whatever that may be). It isn’t unusual for there to be four temples next to each other—one for each aspect of devotion with followers visiting whichever is most appropriate for their needs.</p>\n<p>All sites of worship have one item in common: a magical lead box with an amazing lock that holds a copy of the four holy texts of the Axiomatic General (The Four Planes of Certain Truth) plus one additional book of specific thoughts on the area of expertise of the congregation. These boxes are identical as adornment or elaboration is forbidden as an unnecessary distraction, and are always at the centre of any service of worship or decision-making process. Whenever the box is locked after its final use for the day, the text within each book is updated via divine intervention if a more accurate and truthful version of any piece of information has been discovered and when new facts have been uncovered.</p>\n<p>Each place of worship also contains the thought processes of anyone who has worked to uncover indisputable truths, as well as the evidence that demonstrates that truth. Whenever someone is uncovering a new truth, their work-in-progress materials are stored here as well.</p>\n<h2>Holy Texts</h2>\n<p>The Four Planes of Certain Truth contain the pertinent and unequivocal statements confirmed by the Axiomatic General. When stored in their magical box they are updated via divine intervention when it is locked at the end of the day. No decision is made without this box being present, even if it isn’t used. Clerics of the Overseer of War receive notification of changes as part of their meditation; all clerics and service leaders are encouraged to learn the texts by heart (as interpretation isn’t required).</p>\n<p>Each book bears a simple cover, binding, and little decoration other than an iron rod over a stylized letter that identifies its contents. Other documents stored at temples and shrines have these two symbols plus the initials of the author and the date of publication. When any document is superseded, the date of its relegation from cannon is stamped on the cover and the original symbols are scored through.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h3><em><strong>Axioms of War</strong></em></h3>\n<p>This contains the latest approved plans for war as a whole, as well as tactics for individual fights. The core content—when consulted prior to a battle—confers both a confidence-boosting and calming effect as it confirms how its actions bring eventual victory in the war (with that day’s battle an important part of it). Chapters detail the stages of engagement and explain the surest way forward at each point. They describe how a lawful plan can be overcome by the sheer weight of chaos, but also how to learn from that experience and counter it in the next battle.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<h3><em><strong>Axioms of Law</strong></em></h3>\n<p>This contains the latest approved plans for passing legal judgment as a whole, as well as tactics for individual cases. When consulted prior to establishing guilt or innocence, it confers both a clarity- and authority-boosting effect as it confirms how its actions ensure the correct judgment is reached. Chapters detail the stages of ascertaining the truth from all that has been presented as evidence as well as methods to consider it in an effective, efficient, and impartial manner. They also describe how well-made laws can be twisted and broken by the inherently devious, and how to rewrite those laws to ensure this doesn’t happen in future.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<h3><em><strong>Axioms of Decisions</strong></em></h3>\n<p>This contains the latest methods and directions for effective and efficient meditation as well as long-established research techniques from the church’s greatest sages and experts. When consulted before an investigation is started, it confers a mind-clearing and attention-focusing effect as it confirms how its actions allow a user to reveal the most pertinent and accurate information. Chapters detail how to consider what needs to be discovered, how to ensure what is found matches the initial requirements, and then how to use the information to make the correct decision. They also describe how distraction, obfuscation, and distortion of aims and objects (such as shortcuts) lead to an incorrect decision with long-term consequences.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<h3><em><strong>Axioms of Enlightenment</strong></em></h3>\n<p>This contains pathways to understanding the world at large and the part one plays in that world as well as how the best of life is achieved through the order. When consulted before meditating, it confers an open-mindedness that ensures the route to enlightenment is properly followed as it confirms how its actions allow a user to reach self-knowledge without deviation or distraction. Chapters give details on what to do before, during, and after meditation, as well as how to realize enlightenment has been reached. They also describe how our contemplation can be lessened by the actions of others, but how these digressions can be overcome and enlightenment eventually reached.</p>\n<h2>Holidays</h2>\n<p>The Axiomatic General is not celebrated at any specific festivals. Instead, when the law prevails during any of the god’s areas of interest, followers offer a prayer of thanks no more than 30 minutes after the event. If gratitude is shown later than this, it probably means the follower was distracted from the task at hand and has acted in a chaotic way to make the thanks fit in. Better to acknowledge the effect of the Overseer of War with one’s body and mind than take yourself away from a pressing matter and make two situations chaotic.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n</div>","markdown":""},"_id":"OB8fp8gIre5yoZax","image":{},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"sort":400000,"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"JournalEntry.0FSVjV3WkdoAk7OX.JournalEntryPage.K8IEnGHHZ3800Nio"}}},{"name":"Ancestor Spirit","type":"text","title":{"show":false,"level":1},"text":{"format":1,"content":"<div class=\"aventyr\">\n<p class=\"s5\">Ancestor Spirit</p>\n<img style=\"margin:0px 10px 10px 0px;border:0px;float:right\" src=\"modules/aaw-games-aventyr/Deities-Images/waterfall_edit-scaled.webp\" width=\"244\" height=\"698\" />\n<p><strong>Titles: </strong>Breath of Life, Life Spirit</p>\n<p><strong>Home: </strong>Positive energy plane</p>\n<p><strong>Alignment: </strong>NG</p>\n<p><strong>Portfolio: </strong>Ancestor, nature, wilderness, wisdom</p>\n<p><strong>Worshippers:</strong> @UUID[JournalEntry.QlctNkzE9injOde9.JournalEntryPage.I4CpK8rTs0HgD7hW]{Vikmordere}</p>\n<p><strong>Domains: </strong>Animal, Community, Plant</p>\n<p><strong>Subdomains: </strong>Ancestors, Seasons, Souls</p>\n<p><strong>Favored Weapon: </strong>Wooden staff</p>\n<p>The Ancestor Spirit venerates reconnection with nature, and exploration of one’s inner being without the scourge of individual financial gain.</p>\n<p>    The pure energy which forms this deity is comprised of the souls of the original ancient settlers of the @UUID[JournalEntry.QVrlu0lTv2vFtT5P]{Klavek Kingdom}/@UUID[JournalEntry.Cg0Nt8mDPQ7JrmyB]{Vikmordere}.

He was dissatisfied; dwarves had become a lesser race, overcome by the @UUID[JournalEntry.QlctNkzE9injOde9.JournalEntryPage.8HyVcZ70eyhwNJsu]{Drow}, among others. His life was punctuated by constant struggle and heroic feats that are the things of legend: he re-mastered the lost arts of metalworking once known by his ancestors; he defended his homeland single-handedly against creatures of the Underworld, and he built himself a flawless suit of unbreakable armour. Inside this shell, he was an unstoppable force, and Balir took back thousands of miles of once-dwarven lands. He rose higher than any before making the fatal flaw of offering his hand in peace to the drow.</p>\n<p>The story goes that the Drow cast a curse of burning into his unbreakable armour, sealing the dwarf inside and setting it ablaze forever. But at this moment the gods saw Balir as the greatest martyr of his people and granted him a spark of divinity; he awoke as a god, still within the armour that had become his tomb, and departed the mortal realm.</p>\n<p>Having risen from the ranks of mortals, Balir has been forced to prove himself to the gods over and over again, showing them he is worthy. His feats as a god are no less than his feats as a mortal, although they take place in realms far beyond man’s comprehension. It is from one of these divine toils that he claimed his mighty hammer, Soul Forger – a weapon clearly claimed from a creature many times larger than Balir himself.</p>\n<p>Even as he found himself a god, Balir kept his destroyed mortal form as a sign of his penance. Instead of divine flesh, he constructed a metal body for himself to replace the one he lost. This new skin is without the flaw of mercy that destroyed him as a mortal. And although Balir’s scarred face is unmistakably dwarven, his body is anything but. A cast of white mithral and black iron, he appears more machine than man. Now, even with his drow-cursed armour destroyed, he still blazes with the murderous fire; in his chest, he carries a spark from which the sun was born. When he does not appear in his divine form, Balir assumes the guise of a young dwarf, typically bearing scars on his face and arms from flame.</p>\n<h2>Churches, Clergy, and Worshippers</h2>\n<p>Churches to Balir are at once humble and magnificent. Their areas of worship are simple and unadorned, although always practical, in a manner befitting dwarven life itself. Whether the smallest shrine or grandest cathedral, sites dedicated to Balir always stand near a place of work, toil, and creation. In them, they are guided by Balir’s ancient knowledge and secrets to produce machines, mechanical goods, and works of active art unlike anywhere else in the world. Balir’s clergy are predominantly dwarven, although some humans do acclaim his faith as well. Where they can, they dress in mithral and crimson – styling themselves after their god. Poorer members of the faith dress instead in white and yellow. Worshippers almost always offer constructed items as their offering. If they do resort to just money, it’s always directed toward a newly-qualified crafter or a promising apprentice.</p>\n<h2>Holy Text</h2>\n<p>The Life of Balir is unlike any standard book of holy teachings. Instead, this tome is almost three thousand pages long and details the thousand trials and tribulations of Balir’s life, written in such a way that it is more like a dwarven self-help book than divine instruction. Some versions have additional volumes discussing the merits of each action Balir took, although these are known to be opinions, not facts. The original text is unchanged from when it was penned by Balir’s own son, after the dwarf’s ascension to godhood.</p>\n</div>","markdown":""},"_id":"SjKuUjzrx9TNLn0y","image":{},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"sort":500000,"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"JournalEntry.EykWA9hRZOjLFz6G.JournalEntryPage.JtgEqWY5XOkGnzgZ"}}},{"name":"The Current","type":"text","title":{"show":false,"level":1},"text":{"format":1,"content":"<div class=\"aventyr\">\n<p class=\"s5\">The Current</p>\n<img style=\"float:right;margin:0px 10px 10px 0px;border:0px\" src=\"modules/aaw-games-aventyr/Deities-Images/The-Current.webp\" width=\"267\" height=\"316\" />\n<p><strong>Alignment:</strong> LN</p>\n<p><strong>Portfolio:</strong> Insanity, Mysticism, Seas, Underworld Waters, the Unknown</p>\n<p><strong>Domains:</strong> Madness (Nightmare), Magic (Arcane), Void (Dark Tapestry), Water (Oceans)</p>\n<p><strong>Favoured Weapon:</strong> Tentacle (whips, spiked chains)</p>\n<p><strong>Favored Animals:</strong> Octopus, Squid</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>History</h2>\n<p>The other deities of Aventyr are forever vigilant for even the slightest brush of the Current’s tentacles in their plans or near their essence, keeping a respectful distance from the maddening god. Its motives are totally unpredictable, though it strikes swiftly and without warning when it is suited to do so. The affairs of the gods don’t seem to bear any interest to the Current, however, and it is thought to be slumbering, like the massive beasts that lay in the ruins of the vestraadi’s ancient civilizations. Indeed, some believe that these enormous predators are somehow related to the maddening god and not without good reason; they appeared not long after the Current came to Aventyr.</p>\n<h2>Appearance</h2>\n<p>Records of The Current’s appearance are extremely vague by necessity; those that look upon it are driven utterly mad. The few reliable accounts claim that it is floating, slithering or pulsating mass of writhing tentacles, the end of each covered in barbs of colours for which there is no shade or name.</p>\n<h2>Churches of the Maddening God</h2>\n<p>These revered houses of worship completely encompass those within them, covered in sculptures of tentacles that extend throughout the structure. The holiest of these churches are actually made from the recovered limbs of enormous squids and octopuses—the architecture within them drives any non-followers of the Current to madness, afflicting any creature within with a form of insanity should they fail a DC 16 Wisdom saving throw.</p>\n<h2>Holy Text</h2>\n<p>No books exist for the religion of the maddening god; instead, the vestraadi keep song strings. When wound or unwound underwater, these magical cords play hymns of the Current’s religion (in a tongue those that hear them can understand). The holiest and most valuable of these song strings are said to relate the true origins of the aquatic deity but are said to drive those that hear them mad with the voice of the Current, cursed to forever live with its echo in their mind.</p>\n<h2>Vast Swamp</h2>\n<p>@UUID[JournalEntry.g4odaMsHbRkeNFhn.JournalEntryPage.oIbJsrbNZu7GVWp9#the-muddy-mangroves]{The Muddy Mangroves} has always been the center of the Current’s clergy in the Vast Swamp.

The others chose their domains carefully, but Eureum took his from necessity. For, there must be balance in life as there must be balance in death.

It is said, that beneath the cowl, he perpetually weeps.</p>\n<p>   When he does not appear in a humanoid form, he appears as a collection of dry autumn leaves blowing in the wind.</p>\n<h2>Church of Eureum</h2>\n<p>Much to his dismay, most of Eureum’s churches are misguided, focusing only on one aspect – either death or rebirth – and are often fanatical in their beliefs. He considers only a few shrines to him, often deep within forests and away from civilization, to be true churches.</p>\n<h2>Worshippers and Clergy</h2>\n<p>Eureum’s followers are more often fanatics than they are proper clergy, focusing either on bringing either death or life wherever they go instead of maintaining the cycle of life and death.</p>\n<p> His true followers dress in dirty brown robes, often matted with dried leaves and crawling with tiny insects.</p>\n<h2>Holy Text</h2>\n<p>On Death: This book details the cycle of death, and life, and how all life depends on death for sustenance as much as death depends on life – for one is impossible without the other.

Her mother, Laelstra, was the Matron’s personal seeress. Hivaka possessed only the slightest of her mother’s magical abilities, mastering cantrips at an early age, but progressing no further. Being the youngest daughter, barely older than her only brother, and her sisters already being groomed for succession to various positions within the House, Hivaka found herself being used as leverage but almost everyone around her.</p>\n<p>    Hivaka’s father, Elkerd, was first son of House Kilduis, allies of House Ruim. Among Elkerd’s vices was gambling—he never minded losing, as long as fun was had by all. The problems began when he started using House Kildius’ assets to cover his wagers. When he was financially cut off from House Kilduis, he took the step of offering his youngest daughter, Hivaka, to the winner of a game of orbben. When Elkerd lost to Imfein of House Rilyntyl, a rival of House Kilduis, Hivaka was taken from her home by force. Laelstra protested, but there were too many reliable witnesses to the wager for her challenges to hold sway over her Matron. Thus, Hivaka was taken into slavery by House Rilyntyl. Laelstra attempted to buy Hivaka from Imfein, but was rebuffed, as having a bargaining chip against House Kilduis’ ally was worth much more than gold.</p>\n<p>     Aside from the hard labour she and many others were forced to endure, Hivaka was treated well—as well as a slave could be treated, anyway. She took her enforced servitude in stride, seeing as how she had almost never held any power of significance in her life. However, she harboured a hatred for her father, not understanding how a parent could blithely hand over their child’s life to another simply to cover a bet.</p>\n<p>     The guards from House Imfein did not treat her any better or any worse than any of the other slaves. Neither did they prohibit her mother from visiting her occasionally during the evening, as long as no escape attempts were made. They did, however, restrain her from braining her father with her work hammer the one and only time he approached her during a shift of breaking up rocks. If not for the guards, Elkerd would have died violently, but possibly not quickly.</p>\n<p>     Hivaka was a slave of House Imfein for almost a full year before Laelstra recruited a large following and put a plan into action that would free Hivak: she and her cohort would attack the Imfein guards at the slave pens during the night and Hivak would escape in the confusion while wearing the battle-dress of a House Imfein sorceress.</p>\n<p>      The assault appeared to be a success as chaos reigned in the slave pens, however, Laelstra had not anticipated two things: first, there were more guards than anticipated, causing longer holdups and more casualties as the attacking mob progressed. More guards also meant that an alarm could be sounded, bringing reinforcements, which compounded the existing issues with the rescue.</p>\n<p>    The second issue was that Hivaka had determined that no matter where she was in drow society, she would be enslaved. Either to another house or within her own, where she would be used as a pawn in countless numbers of schemes by her Matron and her own family. As the youngest daughter, she held the lowest standing. Because of this, she was determined not to return to her home.</p>\n<p>    Once in possession of the Imfein battle dress, Hivaka pulled the attached hood over her head and began leading slaves away, using her implied authority, along with some well-placed and spectacular-looking cantrips, to move them without interference. She had nearly one hundred slaves with her when they left the Xdot border.</p>\n<p>   Leading them on through the night, Hivaka found a narrow cave entrance that led into a larger cavern inside. Using the last of her available magicks, Hivaka attempted to cover the mouth of the cave with an illusion showing solid rock. The image was far more effective than Hivak knew because she and her group had attracted the attention of @UUID[.2MMXPI4kINBOYNOP]{Leacim}, the only known male drow deity.</p>\n<p>     A trickster among the more serious drow goddesses, @UUID[.2MMXPI4kINBOYNOP]{Leacim} took this opportunity to thumb his nose at his sisters and to have fun, watching as the drow patrols searched the area over and over, never seeing past his illusions.</p>\n<p>     The rescued slaves began worshipping Hivaka as a saviour. She resisted their praise, saying that she was simply another slave, like them. Leacim—knowing that these slaves needed someone to look up to, invested a small amount of his power in Hivaka, raising her above the mortals, but not so high as the divine: he made her a demigoddess.</p>\n<p>     Those under her protection turned their new home into a town, called Nhlilolin, which has become a haven for the outcasts of the Underworld.</p>\n<h2>Appearance</h2>\n<p>Hivaka is short, for a drow, but heavily muscled from her time as a slave. Her light grey hair is kept short for a drow female, the ends reaching her jawline. Her eyes are blue, relatively rare in the Underworld, and if you look into them, you will find nothing but steely resolve.</p>\n<p>   Hivaka keeps her clothes simple, preferring pants and shirts that have pockets. The more pockets, the better. She is never anywhere without the hammer that she used to break the chains of the other slaves before leading them off into the night. Every morning or after any combat, she repairs the wooden handle with the mending cantrip.</p>\n<h2>Church of Hivaka</h2>\n<p>Hivaka, as a very recent demigoddess, does not have a church, but those that were rescued from imprisonment literally sing her praises every day. She downplays her role as a saviour or someone to be worshipped. She does have her devoted followers and, thanks to @UUID[.2MMXPI4kINBOYNOP]{Leacim}, she is able to grant them a small number of spells. She has not gained any paladins, though.</p>\n<h2>Worshippers and Clergy</h2>\n<p>Those who escaped with Hivaka are her greatest worshippers, but any who have escaped bondage freely speak her name with reverence. There is no set clergy in Nhilolin, but some apostles go out into the Underworld (and a few to the Upperworld) and speak against slavery, striving to free those that are held down, if only through word if not deed.</p>\n<p>     Some of these preachers will gather the like-minded with them and attempt to free those taken by slavers. These zealots do not care if they live or die, as long as those imprisoned go free.</p>\n<h2>Holy Text</h2>\n<p>The Journey: The only text that Hivaka doesn’t simply shake her head at is The Journey. This collection of parchments is the story of not only Hivaka leading the slaves of House Imfein to freedom, but every person who has escaped from an overlord is welcome to add their story to The Journey. So far, almost three hundred stories have been put into the collection.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>A second “holy text” has begun circulating throughout Nhilolin and the Underworld, speaking of Hivaka in the holiest of languages, greatly exaggerating her abilities, and almost, but not quite, painting her as the goddess who will eventually overthrow the mightiest of slavers, Naraneus herself. Hivaka has tried to explain that the book, The Light of Hivaka and the Way Forward, brings attention to her and the town, which is mentioned by name in the book, and could lead to them all being recaptured. This explanation has failed, so far.</p>\n<p> </p>\n</div>","markdown":""},"_id":"fGrUoxdeUcElXl1w","image":{},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"sort":1000000,"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"JournalEntry.0ZJ73TBS2gtaaHzz.JournalEntryPage.8ICOLekqb9Rv4c6W"}}},{"name":"Ja Qua","type":"text","title":{"show":true,"level":1},"text":{"format":1,"content":"<div class=\"aventyr\">\n<p class=\"s5\">Ja Qua</p>\n<img style=\"float:right;margin:0px 10px 10px 0px;border:0px\" src=\"modules/aaw-games-aventyr/Deities-Images/Ja-Qua.webp\" width=\"263\" height=\"235\" />\n<p><strong>Titles: </strong>Mother, Jaguar Queen, Heart of the Jungle, She Behind the Leaves</p>\n<p><strong>Home: </strong>The Fey Jungle</p>\n<p><strong>Alignment </strong>LN</p>\n<p><strong>Portfolio: </strong>Strength, The Hunt, Family</p>\n<p><strong>Worshippers:</strong> Actively worshipped by many natives of @UUID[JournalEntry.RMK7HBFDlPXDiURg]{NairaCull}</p>\n<p><strong>Domains: </strong>Strength, Animal, Law, Protection</p>\n<p><strong>Subdomains: </strong>Ferocity, Fur, Resolve</p>\n<p><strong>Favoured</strong> <strong>Weapon:</strong> Natural Claws, Maquahuitl</p>\n<p>Considered by a vast majority of the native peoples of NairaCull to be she who controls the balance of life within their lands, the worship of Ja Qua is the dominant faith within the dark nation.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>History</h2>\n<p>Ja Qua herself predates most written language, and her own followers have spent their entire lives passing down the tales told to them from previous generations, leaving her history entirely in the hands of those who revere her. Little is known to her followers of her true origins, only that she has proven to be an active and loyal spiritual force within the lives of those who never looked away from the older forms of worship.</p>\n<p>   Ja Qua exists within a sub-dimension connected to the mainlands of the Seelie Court and has fostered a deep relationship with the fey of her lands, looking upon them with the same love and care as her human followers. In turn, the fey has come to view her as one of their own and a revered person of power amongst their courts, and will not hesitate to interact on her behalf within her lands.</p>\n<h2>Appearance</h2>\n<p>Ja Qua appears in one of two forms when she chooses to appear at all. The first is that of a monstrously large and physically powerful jaguar, golden tawny in colour with spots that appear to shift and move before one’s eyes. Crowned with a rim of bony protrusions across her brow and snout, there is no mistaking Ja Qua in her feline form as the self-appointed Queen of her lands. Her second form is one of far more subtlety, one of an attractive woman, typically still keeping the tawny colour of her pelt within her long hair. The colour of her eyes in human form is said to be indescribable, as no true colour exists within nature to compare them to, and her voice will both seduce and petrify you with fear in the same instant.</p>\n<h2>Church of Ja Qua</h2>\n<p>Ja Qua’s worship is strongest within the lands of @UUID[JournalEntry.RMK7HBFDlPXDiURg]{NaeraCull}, though there is the random shrine amongst a few forgotten uncivilized locations, where the march of progress has not severed all of humanity's connection to the Seelie Court yet.</p>\n<h2>Worshippers and Clergy</h2>\n<p>Those tribal warriors deemed worthy are put through a ritualistic challenge to earn Ja Qua’s Blessing, the gift of lycanthropy. Those who survive the process of transformation, and are not driven mad by the ritualistic pain they must go through to prove their worth find themselves in a position of honour amongst the tribes and temples, utilized as guardians and hunters, protecting both the faith and an ancient way of life. Dressed in only a loincloth these warriors tend to embrace the custom of adorning themselves with colourful trinkets and baubles to mark victories over adversaries, or glorious hunts.</p>\n<p>    Those of great enough faith, but not physical stamina to serve the tribes as warriors tend the temples and altars of Ja Qua as her loyal clerics. Over time those of the deepest devotion begin to acquire certain feline traits, though they never achieve the full embrace of Ja Qua as the temple warriors do.</p>\n<h2>Holy Text</h2>\n<p>Scattered throughout the jungle are many lost ruins of forgotten tribes, within which are wall carvings and bas-reliefs depicting the teachings of various points in the history of the church of Ja Qua. Most of the written language of the people of NairaCull is pictographic and has never been compiled into text or bound format, although it is rumoured that a man travels the jungle seeking to do just that.</p>\n<h2>The Dralman Documents</h2>\n<p>A skald of some renown, Theo Dralman was quested by the Grand University of @UUID[JournalEntry.QVrlu0lTv2vFtT5P.JournalEntryPage.dwAJ5Jtc6ii8zQoh]{Mohkba} to enter the dark jungle and learn all he could of the spirits to which the native people prayed, and how the @UUID[JournalEntry.QVrlu0lTv2vFtT5P]{Klavek Kingdom} could use this information to its own end. That was many years ago, and many of the legends spoken amongst the tribes that have encountered Dralman would lead one to believe that his goals have changed, and his search for knowledge has become something far more personal. Most of the legends speak of a man carrying a great many scars, as if he had been mauled to the edge of death, only to be spared and shown a new path. There exist a few rare copies of his incomplete work, taken to the coastal towns by couriers and those on safari…the Dralman Documents they have become known as. All public possession of these documents within the borders of Klavekian-controlled lands is considered treasonous and punishable by seizure of properties and goods, as well as incarceration.</p>\n<p> </p>\n</div>","markdown":""},"_id":"21VmQoL4MPe6mX6q","image":{},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"sort":1100000,"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"JournalEntry.LQT16PQtjrxETCAe.JournalEntryPage.3JNs1m50QSpNDrdf"}}},{"name":"Leacim","type":"text","title":{"show":false,"level":1},"text":{"format":1,"content":"<div class=\"aventyr\">\n<p class=\"s5\">Leacim</p>\n<img style=\"float:right;margin:0px 10px 10px 0px;border:0px\" src=\"modules/aaw-games-aventyr/Deities-Images/Leacim.webp\" width=\"262\" height=\"371\" />\n<p><strong>Titles: </strong>The Clever Shadow</p>\n<p><strong>Symbol: </strong>Spinning 8-faceted gem</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary)\"><strong style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">Alignment: </strong>CN</span></p>\n<p><strong>Portfolio: </strong>Chance, Guile, Illusion, Misfortune, Self-Determination, Thieves</p>\n<p><strong>Domains: </strong>Chaos, Entropy, Deception, Luck, Trickery</p>\n<p><strong>Favoured</strong> <strong>Weapon:</strong> Scimitar, Shortbow, Throwing Knife</p>\n<p><strong>Favoured Animals:</strong> Any beast with camouflage or mimicry (such as a chameleon, stick bug, etc)</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>History</h2>\n<p>The Aventyr god known as Leacim was once a forgotten deity, supplanted by the doings of the colloid aeons before it ever reached the Underworld. Once a treasured god of cunning and wisdom, he was left bereft in the void of the cosmos—when Leacim stared into the void, something from the far beyond stared back. Now slightly deranged and without an identity, the god capered throughout the universe with a will and desire at the whim of his growing insanity.</p>\n<p>   Eventually, the divine energies wrought on Aventyr during the Forging of the Dvergr caught Leacim’s attention, drawing him to the periphery of the world to witness the rise of the progenitors and their fall into the draaki. It was the elven deities, however, that most interested the god of misfortune—over hundreds of years, he subtly infiltrated their pantheon and species, attributing fanatical devotees in the very flesh before spreading them across both Upper- and Underworld. He appeared inexplicably among the elven pantheon, fully adopting the drow form and gathering followers both before and after their exodus from Edhellond.</p>\n<p>     The most famous of these followers is @UUID[.fGrUoxdeUcElXl1w]{Hivaka} , the Savior of the Masses. Leacim took notice when she and her fellow slaves took flight from Xdot. He imparted the aspiring dark elf with some of his divine essences, forever transforming her into a demigoddess.</p>\n<p>   Leacim continues to take an active (albeit underhanded) role in the continued existence of the drow. He travels through the Underworld, briefly touching the souls of dark elves and morphing their alignments towards chaos, neutrality or even goodness if it suits his mood. The lone raider D’thul, a cannibalistic sorcerer-barbarian in the Fungi Forest near Holoth, is one such drow. Those on the surface often see their lives subtly influenced by the trickster god, and Leacim leads them to roles of dubious natures and unexpected rewards.</p>\n<h2>Special</h2>\n<p>Leacim takes delight in angering the other @UUID[JournalEntry.QlctNkzE9injOde9.JournalEntryPage.8HyVcZ70eyhwNJsu]{Drow} gods at every opportunity; his followers may substitute Leacim as the required diety for any item, class, feat or spell that has a drow deity requirement and may select the Drow domain if they have access to domains. Moreover, he often creates his own agents of change—players that wish to play a drow of good alignment in a place that would otherwise prohibit that choice may choose Leacim as their deity to avoid that caveat.</p>\n<h2>Appearance</h2>\n<p>The trickster god has numerous guises but he most commonly appears as an affably dressed male half-drow with an alluring grin or a blonde human girl, regardless of form, both have piercing blue eyes. Leacim’s clothing is generally fashionable and appropriate for the environment, though it is sometimes slightly tattered and seemingly in a state of disrepair. He casually saunters seemingly without a care in the world, a scimitar on his side and a black-lacquered short bow across his back, in the female form he carries only a single knife as a weapon which always returns to him when thrown.</p>\n<h2>Shrines to the Trickster</h2>\n<p>Leacim doesn’t have proper churches—effigies and the like are hidden in plain sight or are places of secret pilgrimage. These shrines are often made to look like they belong to other deities, and only show their true forms when the correct prayers are uttered. Followers that fail a DC 28 Knowledge (religion) check find their god distempered with them after praying at one of these shrines, though they remain unsure as to why (regardless of any divination spells they cast).</p>\n<h2>Holy Text</h2>\n<p>Leacim’s Lexicon is a treasured tome among thieves’ guilds, hidden drow enclaves and the trickster god’s followers. These books appear as unremarkable journals of unremarkable lives to followers of other deities (DC 26 Wisdom saving throw to negate) but in the hands of a devoted acolyte, provide a means to learn any rogue trick, illusion spell, or access to knowledge of prestige classes that require sneak attack as a prerequisite.</p>\n<h2>The Vast Swamp</h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:Signika, sans-serif\">Leahcim has taken root in the @UUID[JournalEntry.g4odaMsHbRkeNFhn]{Vast Swamp}, his trickster ways helping some daredevil rogues on their quest to lessen the burden of treasure on the vile dragons. It must be added that the tales of the rogues have become known but so far none have surfaced to verify these claims. Recently some inhabitants in the marshes have voiced their concerns—that these rumors are merely planted by Leahcim himself for some unknown reason—but the trickster god has plans and schemes no mere mortal can hope to discern.</span></p>\n</div>","markdown":""},"_id":"2MMXPI4kINBOYNOP","image":{},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"sort":1200000,"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"JournalEntry.fAaBvRaalStVHLAa.JournalEntryPage.CYEQQN8Bs7oSr3YE"}}},{"name":"Musta’Vohi","type":"text","title":{"show":false,"level":1},"text":{"format":1,"content":"<div class=\"aventyr\"><p class=\"s5\">Musta’Vohi</p><p><strong>Titles: </strong>God Mother, Heavenly Concubine</p><p><strong>Homel: </strong>Everywhere</p><p><strong>Symbol: </strong>A goat’s head painted black</p><p><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary)\"><strong style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">Alignment: </strong>NE</span></p><p><strong>Portfolio: </strong>Birth, Health, Motherhood, Lust, Pregnancy</p><p><strong>Domains: </strong>Charm, Darkness, Healing, Protection</p><p><strong>Favoured</strong> <strong>Weapon:</strong> Spiked chain</p><p> </p><h2>History</h2><p>According to the @UUID[JournalEntry.dHHrcptCELfN05gb.JournalEntryPage.Tc1kTiX3bvQt4Jd7]{Yerek}, Musta’Vohi created the universe from the sheer will to reproduce.

She wears a simple brown shawl over a simple brown cloak that has the hood pulled back. Her feet are bare and her hands are always opening and closing as if trying to grasp something.</p><h2>Church</h2><p>There is no physical church of Musta’Vohi.

This light both warmed the cosmos and struck out against the darkness that also appeared. This light, both protective and aggressive is embodied in Naneth. She is both Leaf Mother and Warrior Mother.</p>\n<p>   Naneth (NAH neth), her sister @UUID[.leuKpASroHy7r6sn]{Naraneus}, and their brother @UUID[.zNH5DtHDKD52Ufaf]{Onael} created the first elves. Naneth comforted and warmed the elves, but she also taught them to defend themselves. She showed them to care for each other and themselves, but they only had each other to rely on. As the elves evolved, she became more of a mothering figure to them, offsetting the chaotic presence of Naraneus, while Onael drifted away from the family.</p>\n<p>    Eventually, Naraneus became jealous of Naneth’s mothering ways and began a feud between the two that would last for ages and eventually encompass the elves as well, two groups choosing a deity to follow. Naraneus lost and the elves that followed her were banished from Edhellond.</p>\n<p>    Once the war was over, Naneth reflected on Naraneus’s deceit. She decided that if she could not trust her own sister, her children couldn’t trust anyone else. She instructed the Matriarch to retreat completely within @UUID[JournalEntry.wVQiwLZtRuaqbpFA]{Edhellond, the Silent Forest}.</p>\n<p>    Trade relations with the other races suddenly ceased and there was no response from envoys sent to the elves. The entire elven society retreated into Edhellond, turning entirely to hunting, agriculture, and magic; forsaking any trade or relations with other races.</p>\n<p>   Naneth taught the elves that they were to rely only on themselves for everything. There would be no trade, no exchanges of information, no envoys allowed inside Edhellond and only those on secret missions benefiting elvish society were allowed to venture out from Edhellond.</p>\n<h2>Appearance</h2>\n<p>Naneth appears in two forms, befitting her dual nature. In her Asaya Naneth (Leaf Mother) form, she appears as a motherly female Elf, with long golden hair that reaches the ground and she always carries a basket of bright blue flowers. In her Maethor Naneth (Warrior Mother) guise, she appears as a tall, stout elf, dressed in leather armour and a small cap keeping her jet black hair out of the way. Regardless of how she dresses, she has a pin of her symbol at the neck of her garment. She always carries a shield that is designed to look like her symbol.</p>\n<p>    She can change between the two forms in the blink of an eye.</p>\n<h2>Church of Naneth</h2>\n<p>Naneth’s “church” is more of an outdoor shrine at the largest maple tree in the Silent Forest, Tal. Edhellond is a theocracy, led by the current Matriarch or Patriarch, who also leads the services to Naneth.</p>\n<h2>Worshippers and Clergy</h2>\n<p>All surface elves worship Naneth in either of her two forms and worship of both is the norm. Clergy outside of the Matriarch/Patriarch and the Cleric of Naneth selected by the ruler are treated equally regardless of power level or ability. The motto of the clergy is “We only have ourselves” so they do not discriminate in any way.</p>\n<h2>Holy Text</h2>\n<p>The Triploid Text: This tome is separated into sections of three, with each section beginning with a parable of Asaya Naneth, ending with a parable of Maethon Naneth, and the middle section being descriptions of the war between the elves and between Naneth and @UUID[.leuKpASroHy7r6sn]{Naraneus}.</p>\n<p>The cover of the copy that belongs to the Matriarch or Patriarch is created from several massive maple leaves.

Others claim it is the essence of the Honningsop Mushroom, the oldest living thing on the planet, elevated to godhood from the residual divine energies wrought throughout history. Its awakening may not have been caused by the pantheon’s doings, but its emergence seems to coincide with The Grand Sculpting and the Great Schism.</p>\n<p>As the endless caves of the Underworld expanded, vast chambers filled with moisture risen from tunnels hundreds of miles away, creating damp caverns of moist earth. The Natural Force seeded the subterranean breezes with its spores, creating the mushroom jungles and fungal forests of Aventyr. More than that, some of these spores carried the very children of the deity—intelligent, benevolent plant humanoids known as @UUID[JournalEntry.QlctNkzE9injOde9.JournalEntryPage.yv3q3b1HnUnZB2OT]{Funglet}.</p>\n<p>The divine beings of Aventyr generally regard the great nature deity of the Underworld with a measure of respect, if they acknowledge it at all. It answers the calls of its followers but is remarkably slow to act openly, playing the great game of the gods with a level of detachment and planning that no other deity can fathom.</p>\n<h2>Appearance</h2>\n<p>When the Natural Force does appear (which is extremely rare), it does so as a @UUID[JournalEntry.QlctNkzE9injOde9.JournalEntryPage.yv3q3b1HnUnZB2OT]{Funglet} of enormous height, colored in a kaleidoscopic mixture of all the different subtypes and carrying a gigantic club made from a fantafungi. Every patch of earth the Natural Force touches erupts with a random assortment of mushrooms immediately after he breaks contact with it, and all naturally grown barriers part their way for it and take no damage from its passing.</p>\n<h2>Church of the Natural Force</h2>\n<p>Any monument or sculpture of a mushroom serves as a shrine to the Natural Force, though acolytes of the nature deity pray to fungus of large size or greater if they are able to. Sites of particular religious significance always bear an importance to the number three, though none are sure why (save the Natural Force and its wisest adherents, though they have never revealed it).</p>\n<h2>Holy Text</h2>\n<p>The Libre Boletus is a tome crafted from boletann pages. Anyone that casually skims the book sees nothing but simple gardening tips to encourage the growth of mushrooms, but should they read it fully through, the pages transform to explain the tenets of the Natural Force’s faith.

Together, they created the beings that would become knows at elves. @UUID[.oyFVdicDq8mbjOWw]{Naneth} provided the loving and mothering aspect. She showed them how to care for and protect each other, teaching them skills they needed to survive. @UUID[.leuKpASroHy7r6sn]{Naraneus} provided the chaos that seemed to pervade this new world and taught the elves about death and destruction and how to kill for food. Onael provided the controlling aspect, teaching the elves that in order to succeed, in spite of the chaos, there needed to be order and control. He taught them leadership and command and that of all the newly formed races, the elves were the greatest of them all.</p><p>    Eventually, over the millennia, the elves evolved away from the controlled savagery and into the form that is more common today. As the world became more ordered, they needed their aggression less and opened themselves up more to the life and magic that surrounded them. Without as much violence, they began to live longer and grew smaller, as their muscles were not needed as much for combat. They understood that they did not need to conquer and control to live in the modern world and accepted their place, arriving in @UUID[JournalEntry.wVQiwLZtRuaqbpFA]{Edhellond}, the Elven land that would become known as the Silent Forest.</p><p>   Onael did not understand. He thought he had taught them correctly. Seeing that the elves had turned their back on him, he took what he considered his “children,” the Edheliast, and retreated from the world to the Forgotten Forest, a demiplane that he considered his home.</p><p>    In the Forgotten Forest, the Edheliast continue to fight for survival, growing bigger, stronger, faster, and more cunning. They fight against animals, magical beasts, and even the souls of dead elves and drow that Onael claims before @UUID[.oyFVdicDq8mbjOWw]{Naneth} or @UUID[.leuKpASroHy7r6sn]{Naraneus} can.</p><p>    Recently, Onael has begun work to reclaim the elves as his own. He has many Edheliast to fight for him and he has created a new beast that will surely be a surprise to the elves.</p><h2>Appearance</h2><p>Onael appears as an Elf of immense size. He stands close to fifteen feet tall and is very heavily muscled. His dark hair is close cropped and shows off a widow’s peak. He is dressed conservatively, wearing only a black tunic with his symbol on the left breast, black pants, and black boots. On his left hip rest his longsword Coiasan.</p><p> Images of @UUID[.oyFVdicDq8mbjOWw]{Naneth}, @UUID[.leuKpASroHy7r6sn]{Naraneus}, and Onael show that there is a sibling similarity between the three, but Onael claims that he has no sisters.</p><h2>Church</h2><p>There is no church of Onael. There are no services or high priests, only combat. The Edheliant serve Onael by fighting and honing their skills.</p><h2>Worshippers and Clergy</h2><p>Every Edheliant worships Onael in trials by combat. The Edheliant dedicate every battle they participate in to Onael’s glory and ask for him to fill their bodies with power to crush their enemies.</p><p>   There is no church hierarchy. Those that Onael graces with the merest fraction of his power use the spells granted to them to enhance the combat abilities of their comrades and themselves. Onael’s clerics call themselves “Sword Arms” and mostly use spells that increase Strength or Constitution but will also make liberal use of Cure spells and Channeling Energy (if Neutral) to make sure they and their comrades can continue fighting.</p><h2>Holy Text</h2><p>None, although any manual that teaches someone a new fighting technique or improves on an existing technique are considered sacred and are kept in a “library” in the middle of the Forgotten Forest.</p><p> This library is really just many piles of books collected from different planes and realms and every book in the collection deals with some sort of combat.

In the time after the Sun Lord brought the warming of the land, Storjeger led numerous hunts into the forest where they killed many animals. In the bounty that was the land warming, they hadn’t realized that they had over-hunted, leaving the land unbalanced. This led to a lack of game when the land began to cool after the Sun Lord’s death.</p><p>      As the tribe began to dwindle due to lack of food in the harsh winter, Storjeger, as thin as the rest of the tribe, went into the forest alone to find what food he could. After several hours, he spotted a large stag with an impressive rack of horns. Sneaking as close as he dared, his hands trembling from hunger, he threw his javelin. It missed badly, but instead of rushing into the woods, the deer turned and looked at Storjeger.</p><p>    The stag turned and walked slowly into the woods with Storjeger close behind. Following the deer for another hour, Storjeger had been led him to a place in the woods he had never been before. In the distance, he saw a herd of deer that numbered in the dozens with many calves. He prepared his javelin, but the deer he had followed looked at him and then knelt down, laying down its head. It was joined by three does, each kneeling down and offering their necks to Storjeger.</p><p>    Storjeger drew his knife and offering thanks to the deer for their sacrifice, killed the four. He took a few small pieces of meat for himself to sustain him for the trip back. He produced a large sack and bundled the three deer into it and tied the bag to his belt. The stag, he hefted onto his shoulders as a sign of respect.</p><p>     He made the walk back to the Skykosh tribe with tears in his eyes as he knew he could provide for his people. On the trip back, Storjeger realized that his people had to live in balance with the animals of the forest in order to make sure this didn’t happen again. As it was partly his fault that the tribe was in such a predicament, Storjeger was determined to protect the balance of the forest.</p><p>     Upon returning to his tribe, he delivered the deer and explained what had happened and what he had seen and the understanding of the balance. He took the head of the stag and created a mask from it and made a coat from the skin. Without another word, Storjeger walked out of the village and into the realm of the gods, making the name Storjeger synonymous with survival and donning the mantle of God of the Hunt.</p><p>    Storjeger (STOR jay ger) almost always appears as a giant elk but sometimes manifests as a thin warrior of medium height with a stag’s head and horns. He carries several javelin on his back, a longbow made from Yggdrasil, and three arrows, each unique and powerful.</p><p>      Storjeger was originally worshipped only by the @UUID[JournalEntry.QlctNkzE9injOde9.JournalEntryPage.I4CpK8rTs0HgD7hW]{Vikmordere}, but in a very brief period before the @UUID[JournalEntry.QlctNkzE9injOde9.JournalEntryPage.DXD1ygEckY0JIUFB]{Klavekians} went to war with the Vikmordere, there was an exchange of information, including the tale of Storjeger.

More than a physical being, as the insectoids came to dominate the planet of the alien god’s origin, Zagnexis manifested as the congealed consciousness of their dead. While the other intelligent lifeforms on that world fought valiantly, with a deific being directing the racial hive mind of the @UUID[JournalEntry.QlctNkzE9injOde9.JournalEntryPage.SGw7zGFtvjLNPDMY]{hoyrall}, they quickly came to rule over all that the insect god could perceive.</p>\n<p> Until the Great Schism. The progenitors, cast down from their once mythic forms into the lowly race now known as the draaki, made a desperate cry to the cosmos and it was Zagnexis that answered their plea. Mustering the unimaginable power granted from the complete devotion of an entire race of creatures, the insect god transported his entire physical form into Aventyr—Zagn, along with tens of thousands of hoyrall—directly across the universe and into the Dracoprime’s skull, killing the draconic monstrosity instantly.</p>\n<p>    For some generations, Exis continued to direct its children on Aventyr, growing a massive army within the fortress-hives of the hoyrall in preparation for an all-out assault to conquer both the surface and the Underworld. Were it not for the intervention of the colloid during The Confluence, it surely would have succeeded. The other alien entity seized upon Exis conduit to its children, breaking the hive mind of the hoyrall and sending its physical counterpart, Zagn, careening into the oceans of Aventyr to wreck havoc upon everything it meets.</p>\n<p>    Since then, Exis has retained what connections it can to Aventyr, granting powers to its clerics and oracles but little more. The alien god wants nothing more than to expand and procreate, increasing its deific power by generating a second world of followers. Exis is avaricious and without regard for the general balance of natural powers; it will stop at nothing to re-establish its hold over both Zagn and the hoyrall before consuming all of Aventyr.</p>\n<h2>Appearance</h2>\n<p>Exis is a spectral insect composed of dozens of different arthropods, its countless limbs, heads, eyes and antennae constantly morphing into new shapes or variations. Zagn is an enormous, multi-headed (and multi-mouthed) segmented worm with thousands upon thousands of legs that span a body measured by miles.</p>\n<h2>Church of Zagnexis</h2>\n<p>Temples, churches and shrines devoted to the alien god are commonly found throughout the fortress-hives of the hoyrall and honeycombed into Upperworld mountains, but most are in terrible states of disrepair. The unrest following The Confluence led to the dissolution of hoyrall society, and the sites of worship to the god that once bound them all together were quickly targeted by dissenters and never-do-wells. New churches to Zagnexis are well-appointed and carefully kept, tiled with the carapace of insects in exquisite mosaics that depict the journey of the hoyrall.</p>\n<h2>Holy Text</h2>\n<p>There is no written or oral tradition to the worship of Zagnexis; lesser followers are taught the rites of worship through nonverbal communication (through limbs or antennae), and acolytes meld their minds with greater priests in ritual-driven meldings of the minds. Only this devout form of communication is fit for the transmission of the holiest information known to the worshippers of the insect god.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n</div>","markdown":""},"_id":"BgaAYMVXk3L6daU4","image":{},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"sort":2200000,"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"JournalEntry.1nhWSRlTjP4u99gB.JournalEntryPage.vHtchpvGcDlwG7Ja"}}},{"sort":2150000,"name":"Xio","type":"text","_id":"o7Bl7XnxenERvjAq","title":{"show":false,"level":1},"image":{},"text":{"format":1,"content":"<div class=\"aventyr\"><p class=\"s5\">Xio</p><p><strong>Titles:</strong> The Eternal Combatant, Captain of Captains, The Blood Rage</p><p><strong>Home:</strong> Valhalla</p><p><strong>Symbol:</strong> A star crafted from five crossed swords surrounding a bleached skull</p><p><strong>Alignment:</strong> NE</p><p><strong>Portfolio:</strong> Bravery, Combat, War</p><p><strong>Domains:</strong> Destruction, Ferocity, Honor, Strength, War</p><p><strong>Favored Weapon:</strong> Warhammer and handaxe</p><p>Xio is the deity of battle, both honorable and otherwise; he goes wherever there is war or brings it to lands where it is not, ensuring constant and glorious battle.</p><h2>History</h2><p>None truly know when Xio came into existence, but it is said that as long as there has been conflict, he has been amongst those who fight.

Anyone whose business is war is almost unwillingly bound to the Captain of Captains, and his blessing is known to turn the tide of battle on numerous occasions. His clergy are most often those who begin war, or followers that find peace where it exists and start a violent conflict. Most lands find these warmongers to be no better than bandits (worse than most) resulting in an almost world-spanning bounty for Xio’s clergy—a fact which they relish, meeting each new bounty-hunter with zeal and their god’s greatest blessings.</p><h2>Holy Text</h2><p><em>The Business of War</em><br />Though there are strategic insights to be gleaned from these heavy tomes, the business of war is largely about relishing the glory of battle more than how to conduct it.</p><p> </p></div>","markdown":""},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{"core":{"sheetClass":""}}},{"sort":1250000,"name":"The Mother Spirit","type":"text","_id":"7JZLaCukpLMqn2R2","title":{"show":true,"level":1},"image":{},"text":{"format":1,"content":"<div class=\"aventyr\"><p class=\"s5\">The Mother Spirit</p><p><strong>Titles:</strong> The Great Mother, Leaf Gatherer, Four Heart</p><p><strong>Home:</strong> A nexus of the elemental planes of Air, Earth, Fire and Water</p><p><strong>Alignment:</strong> Neutral Good</p><p><strong>Portfolio:</strong> nature, creation, family</p><p><strong>Worshippers:</strong> @UUID[JournalEntry.QlctNkzE9injOde9.JournalEntryPage.myrc4omqUaiD3RKZ]{Halfling}and fey of @UUID[JournalEntry.PCe82J4UbHQWFYYL]{Picollo}, and those who believe in the Four Winds theory of creation.</p><p><strong>Domains:</strong> Air, Community, Earth, Fire and Water</p><p><strong>Subdomains:</strong> Family, Metal, Wind, Oceans</p><p><strong>Favored Weapon:</strong> Unarmed strike</p><h2>History</h2><p>Worshipers of the Mother Spirit believe that when the elements came together to form the world, a vessel was required to prevent disastrous interaction between opposed elements. The Mother Spirit gathered the elements into her four-chambered heart to allow them to work in community to craft the world.</p><h2>Appearance</h2><p>The Mother Spirit most often appears as a halfling woman with fey or otherworldy features. She wears a homespun brown robe woven with simple leaf patterns. Her hair is that of autumn leaves, tinged with flame. The presence of the other three elements can be found in her ever present tears of alternating joy and sadness, the comforting breath of her voice, and the adamantine sheen of her forearms and hands.</p><h2>Church of The Great Mother</h2><p>Although worshipped primarily in @UUID[JournalEntry.PCe82J4UbHQWFYYL]{Picollo}, knowledge of the Great Mother has been brought to other areas of Aventyr by halflings displaced by the Great Schism, or fey wandering throughout the lands as their whimsy takes them.</p><h2>Worshippers and Clergy</h2><p>Priests usually dress in homespun robes and go about unarmed. Clerics of the Great Mother must select the community domain (or family subdomain) as one of their domains, but may select any of the elemental domains or subdomains as their second. The prestige class, devotee of the Four Hearts, grants access to additional elemental domains.</p><p>Clerics with the separatist archetype can often be found. The Great Mother recognizes that there are many paths to community, and loves these “Fallen Leaves” as much as any other worshipper, hoping they will one day embrace community as a tenet of faith.</p><h3>Fallen Leaf cleric</h3><p>Fallen Leaves are clerics of the Mother Spirit Mastering the divine nature of dual elements requires further study, available only to the Devotee of the Four Hearts.</p><h3>Devotee of the Four Hearts</h3><p>Devotees of the Four Hearts are worshipers of the Mother Spirit who seek to understand more fully the act of creation initiated by the joining of all four of the elements through a deeper examination of the elements themselves. As their understanding increases, they add additional domains to their repertoire of gifts from the goddess.</p><p><strong>Role:</strong> A Devotee of the Four Hearts is more prepared to deal with elemental challenges than her less erudite brothers and sisters. Because the theological study of the elements is deeply intertwined with the nature of the goddess, the scaling of the holy abilities of these priests are less impacted with a diversion into a prestige class.</p><p><strong>Alignment:</strong> Most members of this prestige class tend to be neutral or neutral good to better understand the balance required in bringing together the elements. Lawful clerics embrace the discipline of safeguarding the elements and the world around them while those elements join in community, whereas chaotic priests embrace the messiness of creation.</p><h2>Holy Text: The Tree of Community</h2><p>Temples to the goddess are centered around a great tree which forms the center of the complex, regardless of its architectural style (or design of the grove in cases of a fey temple). The leaves of the tree contain the holy writings of the Mother, as well as the stories of her worshippers, unnumbered as the leaves themselves. Divination and prophetic magic is often tied to, or enhanced by, the tree of community; to read one’s leaf is to gain insight to one’s soul.</p><p></p><p></p></div>","markdown":""},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}},{"sort":1950000,"name":"Qathindli","type":"text","_id":"jjNtg5QMfe2uI6uS","title":{"show":false,"level":1},"image":{},"text":{"format":1,"content":"<div class=\"aventyr\"><p class=\"s5\">Qathindli</p><p><strong>Titles:</strong> The Monkey Primeval, The Unsullied</p><p><strong>Home:</strong> @UUID[JournalEntry.dHHrcptCELfN05gb.JournalEntryPage.eOVkEXkbiSWbkVcp#treeland]{Treeland}</p><p><strong>Alignment:</strong> Chaotic Neutral</p><p><strong>Symbol:</strong> A monkey face with a painted boomerang for a smiling mouth (only used by humans)</p><p><strong>Portfolio:</strong> Nature, Primates, Wilderness</p><p><strong>Worshippers:</strong> Monkeys and disparate or relocated people from the @UUID[JournalEntry.g4odaMsHbRkeNFhn]{Vast Swamp} or the @UUID[JournalEntry.dHHrcptCELfN05gb]{Yerek Steppes}</p><p><strong>Domains:</strong> Animal, Chaos, Plant, Protection</p><p><strong>Favored Weapon:</strong> Boomerang</p><p></p><p>Two hundred years ago, Mentane Flamebearer, a human cleric of a best-forgotten god, and Golar, his half-orc monk bodyguard landed on the eastern shore of what would become @UUID[JournalEntry.dHHrcptCELfN05gb.JournalEntryPage.eOVkEXkbiSWbkVcp#treeland]{Treeland}. The reason for the visit was that Mentane thought he had found a way to become a god. His hypothesis was that if he could instill the magical essences that he acquired daily into the same place for a long period of time, then the release of that pent up energy into himself would push him past the boundary of mortality and into the realm of godhood. Mentane chose a small fuzzy fruit with a green interior, called a forhoral, which grew on a vine as his receptacle of power.</p><p>As they settled on the eastern edge of the forest Golar began to notice the large numbers of primates in the forest. Ignoring them, Mentane had Golar find a piece of wood to allow the vines of the fruit grow upward.</p><p>For the next year, every morning, Mentane would slowly and carefully direct his magical energies into the seed that he had planted. Golar, not being needed, wandered the forest. Some of the primates took interest in the two for a while, but seeing that they were no immediate threat, they were content to ignore the two.</p><p>After about a month, one small chimpanzee began following the Golar as he explored what would become known as Treeland. He began to call her “Qathindli,” which translated roughly to “small one” in his local Orcish dialect. He would call and wave to her every morning and she would chatter back at him.</p><p>Something surprising that Golar noticed was that Qathindli would watch him when he went through his morning exercises. She would sit on a branch and stare at him while he moved in slow, deliberate patterns. She had taken a special liking to his three-bladed boomerang. When she wasn’t watching him practice, he would almost always find her at his pack, holding the throwing weapon. Eventually, he carved her her own two-bladed boomerang and placed a leather strap around the two ends. She took it with her everywhere.</p><p>As the year progressed, Mentane’s fruit began to grow, becoming larger than usual for this type of fruit. The vine grew quickly up the post and one year to the day of its planting, Mentane emerged from his tent, ready to become a god.</p><p>His forhoral fruit was gone. In its place, he found Qathindli sitting on the forest floor, holding the remains of the forhoral fruit.</p><p>She sat and stared, her monkey mind not comprehending what was happening to her.</p><p>Mentane began ranting and raving about the amount of effort he put into the project and his loss to a monkey. In his rage, he was preparing to utterly destroy Qathindli when she turned her head toward him and shocked both he and Golar.</p><p>“What is happening to me?” she asked loudly and haltingly.</p><p>All three stared at each other for a moment before Qathindli screeched and ran off into the forest.</p><p>A few days later, Mentane packed up his belongings and stowed them on the boat. He was going to make his way back to the @UUID[JournalEntry.QVrlu0lTv2vFtT5P]{Klavek Kingdom}. Golar said that he was going to stay in the forest for the time being. They bade each other farewell and Golar watched Mentane sail off into the sunrise.</p><p>Golar found Qathindli her near her tribe of monkeys. She was speaking quickly and erratically, words from every language spilling out of her mouth. Golar understood words from a few languages and recognized several more. The other monkeys were frightened of her.</p><p>Using food, Golar tempted Qathindli out of her tree and through a long and arduous process, explained what Mentane had done with the forhoral fruit and that his best guess was that when she had eaten the fruit, she had absorbed all of the magical power invested in it and that she had become more than a monkey.</p><p>Over the course of the next six months, Golar taught Qathindli control thanks to his martial training. While she did learn how to focus her newly found thoughts, she was still a monkey inside. Her train of thought often derailed into a conglomeration of words from different languages, which made it difficult for Golar to understand.</p><p>The change in her standing among the primates came when, as she and Golar were training in a small clearing, a wild boar broke through the undergrowth and charged at Golar. Though the battle was brief, it was also incredibly violent. In the end, the boar lay dead and Golar had numerous cuts and slashes from the boar’s wicked tusks. Qathindli rushed out from her hiding place and chattered at Golar in numerous languages as he started to succumb to his injuries. As he tumbled to the ground, Qathindli placed her hands on him and with a visible light, poured healing energy into Golar.</p><p>The forest around the two of them went silent as the watchful monkeys around them looked on and saw the power that Qathindli now possessed.</p><p>While she may not have been a demigoddess in the classical sense, Qathindli has eclipsed monkeyhood and is something more. She had decided to be the protector of Treeland, which she named herself. When she accepted that mantle, she became a demigoddess.</p><h2>Appearance</h2><p>Qathindli can change her appearance to that of any primate in existence, except human. Her preferred form is a pygmy monkey that stands roughly six inches tall, with bright red hair. This form seems to cause less violent reactions in those that she speaks with than one of her larger shapes.</p><p>Each of her forms has a face that is like the race she is interacting with than it is monkey-like.</p><h2>Church</h2><p>Even though she doesn’t understand it, the humans that live in @UUID[JournalEntry.dHHrcptCELfN05gb.JournalEntryPage.eOVkEXkbiSWbkVcp#treeland]{Treeland} worship Qathindli. The services are held outside usually around midday, but it varies due to the weather.</p><p>The leader of the humans, Damon, teaches that the people of his tribe should live like the monkeys: in harmony with nature. Because of his worship, Qathindli grants him spells, even if she doesn’t know how she does that.</p><h2>Worshippers &amp; Clergy</h2><p>Qathindi’s worshippers are all of the humans that live in Treeland, under the guidance of her only clergy member, @UUID[JournalEntry.dHHrcptCELfN05gb.JournalEntryPage.Tc1kTiX3bvQt4Jd7#damon]{Damon}. One of the titles Damon has given Qathindli is “The Unsullied.” He believes that she is holy because she has never been human, and therefore is above us and unsullied by her nature.</p><h2>Holy Text</h2><p>Qathindli has no holy text to speak of. As her knowledge of language grows, she has had Golar and Damon try to teach her how to write. The two main problems are that monkey hands are not designed for holding human writing utensils and Qathindli still has the mind of a monkey, so any given sentence contains multiple languages and bad translations, making them impossible to read. Damon still collects these “writings” and keeps them safe.</p></div>","markdown":""},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}}],"_stats":{"systemId":"dnd5e","systemVersion":"2.1.2","coreVersion":"10.291","createdTime":1662054505131,"modifiedTime":1674301334112,"lastModifiedBy":"EsIYTtNnjwxUbKOG"},"ownership":{"default":0,"R5IsvMTH5P79pBoG":3},"folder":"j9cXBagzZ1ARsO2I","sort":1000000},{"name":"Races of Aventyr","pages":[{"name":"Elves","type":"text","title":{"show":false,"level":2},"text":{"format":1,"content":"<div class=\"aventyr\">\n<p class=\"s5\">Elves</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<img style=\"margin:0px 15px 15px 0px;border:0px;float:right\" src=\"modules/aaw-games-aventyr/Races-Images/Elf-of-Silent-Forest.webp\" width=\"255\" height=\"363\" />\n<p><em>Elves in human lands are generally considered spies, and looked upon with great suspicion.

A hero may be the exception to the rule, but will never let other races know the secrets of their homeland. Elves live for thousands of years and have an inner-wisdom of the natural world that humans will never attain. They are aloof and secretive and generally keep to themselves. The majority of elves live within the protective confines of the @UUID[JournalEntry.wVQiwLZtRuaqbpFA]{Silent Forest} to the south of the @UUID[JournalEntry.QVrlu0lTv2vFtT5P]{Klavek Kingdom}. The Silent Forest is a magical place where humans are forbidden, and those who have ventured into the forest never return. An elf cannot willingly give up the secrets of her homeland even if tortured, magically manipulated, or even psionically attacked. Most elves choose either the path of magic or nature and given the seemingly endless life they are gifted, excel marvellously in either.</p>\n<h2>The Vast Swamp</h2>\n<p>Magic is used by the Black Gold Consortium to speed up extraction and enhance the efficiency of its workers, tasks excelled at by elven mages and alchemists—it spends a hefty sum to these scholars if they can provide results. Elves reluctantly take the money for their services but their true reasons for inhabiting the area remain hidden from the Black Gold Consortium. The elves’ love of nature is always paramount and the reason why they are truly working with them is to see that the business does not damage the ecosystem of the swamp. Magic means of extraction are cleaner and less damaging to the area, and there are whispers of a secret order of elven saboteurs who work towards stopping any forms of extraction that the elves do not approve of.

Large portions of their island home of @UUID[JournalEntry.PCe82J4UbHQWFYYL]{Picollo} far to the southeast remain uninhabited. Enclaves of exiles across the breadth and width of Aventyr have exposed many nations and races to the existence of halflings, but many isolated folks often perceive them as children or humans of stunted growth.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Halflings bear scant trust for the other races of Aventyr, especially humans, whom they view as feckless and faithless. Halflings from exiled backgrounds are more likely to be trusting of non-halflings and tend to hold more true to the ancient ways and happy-go-lucky traditions of halfling society. Those whose families suffered during the @UUID[.SGw7zGFtvjLNPDMY]{Hoyrall} Wars and enslavement are more prone to pragmatism. This practical outlook has begun to erode the traditional paths of fellowship and community. Though fragile, a bond does still remain between all halflings; it is taboo for one halfling to kill another even under dire circumstances; those that do face banishment. When banding together in groups halflings are a force to be reckoned with.</p>\n<h2>Vast Swamp</h2>\n<p>Halflings are often called upon when the Black Gold Consortium needs something done in a tight spot. Small folk can often find employment cleaning or fixing in-between the cogs of extraction centers, or removing blockages in tall chimneys or long pipes; the work is always dangerous, so they expect to be paid well. The Neliton family is one of the core families in the consortium and in charge of halfling relations in @UUID[JournalEntry.g4odaMsHbRkeNFhn.JournalEntryPage.Tdkqx23iD22AVlLv]{Cherrian’s Rest}. The family’s easy going nature has protected them from the internal conflicts of the consortium—they love to show off their strong sense of fashion. The Nelitons are the trendsetting family of the Consortium, often wearing the finest garments and jewels just to show off their lavishness and to invoke the jealousy of the other families.</p>\n<h2>Subtypes</h2>\n<h3>Seaborn</h3>\n<p>Most of the of the archipelago that made up greater @UUID[JournalEntry.PCe82J4UbHQWFYYL]{Picollo}was buried under the sea when the Dracoprime fell in the Great Schism, but scattered isles remain. Some halflings spend their whole lives on ships traveling between these isles, mainland Picollo, and the rest of Aventyr. While they feel bonds of kinship to all halflings, their ties to their shipmates are the closest. Years of fighting wind and wave have taught them caution, and that discretion is often the better part of valor.</p>\n<h3>Highlanders</h3>\n<p>On the @UUID[JournalEntry.PCe82J4UbHQWFYYL.JournalEntryPage.Gv1vyttllOYQaK2t#the-great-mountain]{The Great Mountain}, the highland halflings were in the thickest fighting during the @UUID[.SGw7zGFtvjLNPDMY]{Hoyrall} Wars as the insect-like race spewed forth from the tunnels and chambers riddling the great peak. Alliances with the @UUID[.RTYoyteEKY7EOhy2]{dweorg} at the base of the mountain and the @UUID[.MsDyrandNiqdPIrd]{zwerc} its top provided arms and armor and magic during the struggle, and often a place of retreat.</p>\n<h3>Tree-Borers</h3>\n<p>These halfling clans live alongside the fey in @UUID[JournalEntry.PCe82J4UbHQWFYYL.JournalEntryPage.Gv1vyttllOYQaK2t#the-great-forest]{the great forest of Picollo}. They make their homes in living trees, hollowed out with a combination of plant husbandry and fey magic. Endless pranks and tricks played on the halflings by their fey neighbors often have them cursing their luck. The tree-borers took in many refugees during the @UUID[.SGw7zGFtvjLNPDMY]{Hoyrall} Wars, and the final resistance was mounted from within the forest itself.

The Vikmordere had been using @UUID[JournalEntry.ismpCNWpGHvB1iPw]{Rybalka}, a village of tribal fishermen and woodworkers as a base of operations for their attacks on the three Riverside Klavekian villages. The village of Rybalka also works a local iron mine which supplied ore for the Vikmordere weapons and shipbuilding tools.</p>\n<p>  The Klavek Kingdom Monarchy moved troops into the Vikmordere Valley and launched an arduous assault against the Vikmordere in hopes of securing this strategic location and obtaining the lucrative iron mine. After many failed attempts and the death of hundreds of Klavekian ground troops, the Klavek Kingdom was finally able to oust the Vikmordere raiders and take over the small village and local mine. In order to hold the location, additional troops were brought in to clear the mountainside forests of the rest of the Vikmordere warriors which resulted in horrible casualties for the Klavekians. Eventually, almost every Vikmordere in a 15-mile radius was slaughtered. A few Vikmordere survived by hiding in abandoned ruins and mountain caves, which were passed up by the Klavek Kingdom soldiers seeing as it was impossible to follow every possible lead in such a large territory.</p>\n<p>The majority of the Vikmordere people still thrive in the mountains and in the deep recesses of the winding Serpent Lake, waiting for the day when a great Vikmordere champion rises up to lead them to victory and reclamation of their ancestor’s land and the village now called “Rybalka” by the filthy Klavs.</p>\n</div>","markdown":""},"_id":"sPIEyCZy4k35amgs","image":{},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"sort":900000,"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"JournalEntry.aQr9obWamQcmAPUN.JournalEntryPage.wRMpAyePvqRtSHn0"}}},{"name":"Human (Klavekian)","type":"text","title":{"show":false,"level":2},"text":{"format":1,"content":"<div class=\"aventyr\">\n<p class=\"s5\">Human (Klavekian)</p>\n<img style=\"float:left;margin:0px 15px 15px 0px;border:0px\" src=\"modules/aaw-games-aventyr/Races-Images/Klavekian-Human-Male.webp\" width=\"282\" height=\"365\" />\n<p><em> </em></p>\n<p>Klavekians are a hearty steadfast people who have been dealt with impossible odds and found ways to cope.

Over thousands of years, the weak have died out while the strong have prospered, leaving a people able to withstand cold temperatures and sometimes go for days at a time without food or water. Although wilderness travel is rarer for those living in big cities, all Klavekians at one time or another must make overland journeys at which point they experience what it truly means to be Klavekian. The Klavek Kingdom retains a massive military presence which dominates the known world.

The following is the story the dwarves tell when asked how they were brought into being.</p>\n<h2>Forging of the Dverger</h2>\n<p>In the days of darkness when the world was young, the gods forged a race from the very heart of the world itself.</p>\n<p>They called this race “Dvergr” and placed them close to the heart of Motherworld.</p>\n<p>The Dvergr thrived and prospered, but as time went on they became greedy, fighting over the precious metals and gems of the Motherworld.</p>\n<p>   The gods foresaw the destruction of the Dvergr at their own hands, thus they divided the race into five parts, each sharing the appearance of the first Dvergr (but only a fragment of its whole)</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>The first </strong>were named @UUID[.RTYoyteEKY7EOhy2]{Dweorg}, and were created from the Dvergr’s hands and heart giving them honor and expert craftsmanship.</p>\n<p><strong>The second</strong> were made from the @UUID[.eMZGcsX17wpAg4DE]{Dvergr’s head} and kept its most proud of names. They stayed deep beneath the world toiling in their greatest cities, only an echo of their former selves.</p>\n<p><strong>The third </strong>were named the @UUID[.MsDyrandNiqdPIrd]{Zwerc}, created from the spirits of the Dvergr. This granted them innate power over magic, their mystical nature making them loners and travelers with an endless thirst for knowledge.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The potent avarice of the Dvergr, however, would not be undone by the gods—traveling far from the deific crafting, the very essence of their greed delved deep into Aventyr, much deeper than the gods had permitted the Dvergr to go. Soon they had discovered HEL—where devils and demons dwell—and while the first three races were created, a pact was forged with the denizens there. The devils granted the Dvergr’s avarice physical form and realms in the deepest, most foul and flaming depths of the Underworld—but they did not stop there. The devils gave the @UUID[.Atn2VIF5a1D1uJUZ]{Gitwerc} the ability to siphon souls from the other races to feed themselves, and in turn they granted the Gitwerc more power.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>When the gods returned to forge the fourth, they found the Dvergr’s entrails snatched up by devils who had turned them into a terrible creature, the Gitwerc.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The gods, realizing their mistake in creating a race with no evil intent, vowed never to do so again and went to work creating the fifth race in secret, using all the remaining parts of the Dvergr. The fifth and final race would be eloquent, honorable, knowledgeable, and nearly immortal, yet the race would be forever divided, torn between light and darkness. Their souls were permanently bound to the world, sentenced with a nearly endless life staring out upon the sea of eternity, never able to attain that balance which comes so easy to the other races. The gods placed this race above and below the world, both in light and in darkness; they became the @UUID[.ei36LjIhEoh87vgE]{Elves} and the @UUID[.8HyVcZ70eyhwNJsu]{Drow}.</p>\n<p>     Then the gods did something which surprised all of the races. They created a realm between Upperworld and the Underworld, using the culminating thoughts of all the new races to forge the “Gift from the Gods”, the first humans: Askr and Embla.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>This gift would bring balance to the world.</strong></p>\n</div>","markdown":""},"_id":"t4LZuyNruvzneOHD","image":{},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"sort":1900000,"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"JournalEntry.Q6HzSBK0eklvkhs2.JournalEntryPage.p9zpIU4TMugYgXJS"}}},{"name":"Dweorg","type":"text","title":{"show":false,"level":3},"text":{"format":1,"content":"<div class=\"aventyr\">\n<p class=\"s5\">Dweorg</p>\n<img style=\"float:left;margin:0px 15px 15px 0px;border:0px\" src=\"modules/aaw-games-aventyr/Races-Images/Dweorg-171x300.webp\" width=\"171\" height=\"300\" />\n<p><em> </em></p>\n<p>Dweorg are the most common @UUID[.t4LZuyNruvzneOHD]{Dwarven} subtype, denizens of the Underworld that enjoy mining and blacksmithing.

The city has tended to have a fractious relationship with Mohkba because, due to the close proximity to the more hostile regions of Klavek territory, it has often found itself as a center of guerrilla activity from @UUID[JournalEntry.QlctNkzE9injOde9.JournalEntryPage.t4LZuyNruvzneOHD]{dwarf}, @UUID[JournalEntry.QlctNkzE9injOde9.JournalEntryPage.lMtTJxWecu1ISdP0]{gnome}, @UUID[JournalEntry.QlctNkzE9injOde9.JournalEntryPage.myrc4omqUaiD3RKZ]{halfling}, and other humanoid communities, all of which have traditionally used the natural resources for themselves. Mohkba’s – and therefore what is considered Tolkovar’s – the response has always been seen as slow at best and as completely ignoring the town at worst. This has led to the citizens of Morsain occasionally holding back wood, ore and taxes from the king, just to make a point.</p>\n<p><em>Read more about Morsain and enjoy a fully fleshed-out city (nearly every location detailed!) in the mega-adventure </em><a href=\"https://adventureaweek.com/shop/pathfinder/snow-white-products/snow-white/\"><em>Snow White</em></a><em>.</em></p>\n</div>","markdown":""},"_id":"ulLkhApELbg08M4o","image":{},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"sort":-150000,"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{"core":{"sheetClass":""}}},{"name":"Mohkba","type":"text","_id":"dwAJ5Jtc6ii8zQoh","title":{"show":false,"level":1},"image":{},"text":{"format":1,"content":"<div class=\"aventyr\">\n<p class=\"s5\">Mohkba</p>\n<img style=\"display:block;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto\" src=\"modules/aaw-games-aventyr/Setting-images/City-of-Mohkba-Large-750x1007.webp\" width=\"261\" height=\"475\" />\n<p> </p>\n<h2>The founding years</h2>\n<p>Sages start the history of Mohkba and thereby @UUID[.ulLkhApELbg08M4o]{Klavek} with the Years of the Angry Sea when the titanic Kraken ravaged the coasts of what today is eastern Klavek. The early @UUID[JournalEntry.QlctNkzE9injOde9.JournalEntryPage.DXD1ygEckY0JIUFB]{Klavekians} had spread from the borders of the elven woods toward the sea and built the first realms there before that time. But since almost everything built near the sea had been destroyed by the beast, the great evacuation that followed started a new age.</p>\n<img style=\"display:block;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto\" src=\"modules/aaw-games-aventyr/Setting-images/octopus-clip-art-2-640x413.jpg\" width=\"477\" height=\"354\" />\n<p>Immunity from attack, so rare in those days, caused the eastward movement of human colonization to become reversed. That is to say, settlers began to flow back from the old-established but now ravaged colonies of the Eastern Sea to the unoccupied lands near the Serpent Tail river. This constituted the first condition which, arising out of the geographical position of Mohkba, contributed to the successful settlement of the Mohkba region. Another condition which contributed to the growth of the Principality was the fact that Mohkba stood upon a river which had always – even from the most ancient times – been possessed of great commercial importance, a waterway connecting Central Klavek with the @UUID[JournalEntry.ismpCNWpGHvB1iPw.JournalEntryPage.Erya8w29cRTTJELu]{Serpent Lake} and its untouched resources. Of course these lucky years were way before the @UUID[JournalEntry.QlctNkzE9injOde9.JournalEntryPage.I4CpK8rTs0HgD7hW]{Vikmordere} discovered there was something worth raiding on the Serpent Tail river. The third factor was that said river was not connected to the eastern ocean and thus safe from the kraken.</p>\n<img style=\"display:block;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto\" src=\"modules/aaw-games-aventyr/Setting-images/Settlement-of-Mohkba-640x480.jpg\" width=\"449\" height=\"387\" />\n<p>Yuri Dvagaslov thus made Mohkba the point where two great popular movements intersected one another – namely, a movement of colonization northeastwards along the Serpent Tail river and a movement of commerce back southeastwards toward the sea once the kraken was sleeping again. The city’s geographical position conferred great economic advantages upon the early Princes of Klavek. A large population attracted to their appanage meant a large number of direct taxpayers, while the movement of a large volume of commercial traffic on the Serpent Tail river before the Vikmordere Wars meant a stimulation of popular industry in his dominions and a large flow of transit-dues into his treasury.</p>\n<p>The physical network of rivers leading toward the lake is first of all a transportation network. The early klavekians traveled the rivers and lake by boats in summer and with sleds over the ice in winter. But the river network supported social interaction. Trading of amber, honey and furs produced economic networks. Marriage alliances and divine exchanges both produced and strengthened social networks. And the frequent interaction permitted the klavekian language to spread and become so dominant over a wide area that it is now known simply as ‘common’.</p>\n<h2>Mohkba today</h2>\n<p>Mohkba has lots of quiet cozy lanes, wooden houses, an incredible number of monasteries and churches, and delicious pickles are on sale on every corner. The capital of Klavek is known for its great towers, most belonging to churches, but others to the nobility or to wizards. When alliances are forged due to marriages, illusions of bridges adorned with shared banners connect the towers, creating an ever changing scenery. Mohkba is composed out of eight quarters. Nobility and commoners share all Quarters, except for the vast @UUID[.LGCNFtJ4cWlq0HjE#gardeners-quarter]{Gardener’s quarter} where but a handful of druids live, the @UUID[.LGCNFtJ4cWlq0HjE#arcane-quarter]{Fortress of Arcane Arts }which is reserved for Magicians and Alchemists and assumed to be a dangerous place anyhow, and the small @UUID[.LGCNFtJ4cWlq0HjE#kings-fortress]{King’s quarter} where only royalty has their homes. The social distinction is made by height, not place, in Mohkba, so even in downtrodden @UUID[.LGCNFtJ4cWlq0HjE#mariners-quarter]{Mariner’s quarter} and reclusive @UUID[.LGCNFtJ4cWlq0HjE#zveni-island]{Zveni island} is nobility to be found.</p>\n</div>","markdown":""},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"sort":650000,"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{"core":{"sheetClass":""}}},{"name":"City Quarters","type":"text","_id":"LGCNFtJ4cWlq0HjE","title":{"show":false,"level":2},"image":{},"text":{"format":1,"content":"<div class=\"aventyr\">\n<p class=\"s5\">City Quarters</p>\n<h2>Divine Quarter</h2>\n<p>Visitors are fascinated by the cathedral of the Sophianeum, the Holy Wisdom of the Gods – the oldest surviving Klavekian stone monument. It was built so long ago that there are no written evidences, which had led to speculations about it being placed there by the gods themselves. Be this as it may, the powerful monolithic massive structure of the monument still dominates not only the divine quarter, but the whole historic center of @UUID[.dwAJ5Jtc6ii8zQoh]{Mohkba}. The basis of its complex three-dimensional architecture is a four-domed, five-columned brick temple of the cross-and-cupola type with a high ground floor. It is built of brick and blue stone, and its blind arcades give it a special beauty and nobility. In the interior of this palladion a faithfuls attention is drawn by the unique historically formed iconostases icons. These are ancient mural paintings, national relics of Klavek that include the famous icon of Yuri Dvagaslov himself, the Holy Knight of the Crossroad. In the course of hundreds of years the Sophianeum was a center of the clerical, political and cultural life of ancient Mohkba.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<img style=\"float:right;margin:0px 15px 15px 0px;border:0px\" src=\"modules/aaw-games-aventyr/Setting-images/085-Cathedral-Tower-from-St-Johns-Street.jpg\" width=\"237\" height=\"316\" />\n<p>     Next to the Sophianeum is Alvarov’s Monastery that was founded by Prince Yaroslav the Witch as early as in the first century after the foundation of Mohkba, as a legend reads, and one cannot help being amazed by the striking beauty of another masterpiece of ancient Klavekian architecture. Many experts of Klavekian art justly believe Mohkba to be blessed by the Gods; no other old Klavekian cities have managed to preserve so many ancient architectural monuments adorned with wall murals. Visitors will see that with their own eyes visiting the churches of the Oreadean Gods on Vlassov Lake, appreciating at its true worth the old frescoes of world-famous Wulfgarin the Dwarf in the Church of the Enchantments on Vassili Street; singularly graceful murals in the Church of the Spirit of Bertramov on Prideful Field, admiring the beautiful clerical wall calendar of the Church of the Nameless Hero and studying wonderful mural compositions in The Sinless Cathedral. The later is also famous for its five-tier iconostasis with icons from up to four centuries ago.</p>\n<p>More mundane, but still very important are the Tower of the Inquisition and the Tower of the Order of the Elk, the latter the chivalric arm of the former and thus connected by a real bridge, one of the oldest non-illusionary bridges connecting Mohkba’s towers.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h3>Armour of Frozen Tears</h3>\n<p>When the @UUID[JournalEntry.QlctNkzE9injOde9.JournalEntryPage.I4CpK8rTs0HgD7hW]{Vikmordere} attacked @UUID[.dwAJ5Jtc6ii8zQoh]{Mohkba} in the old days, legend says that the face of Tsar Alexei VI was awash in tears of wrath, and that it was so cold during that attack that his tears freeze before hitting the ground. Those frozen tears were collected by a dwarven cleric and with the aid of an unknown smith forged into an armour of sparkling brilliance. Tsar Alexei himself wore the armour in the counterattack, when he charged the enemy at the front of his soldiers, and the vile Vikmordere magic dissipated into waterdrops while hitting the tsar, unable to harm him. While most of this tale seems to be a legend, the armour indeed does exist, and the tsars do wear it on the days of their coronation since the days of Tsar Gregory VI, twin brother and successor of Alexei. The armour is clearly magical, since it adjusts to the size of the monarch and even fitted Tsarina Anna’s very womanly body when her coronation came.</p>\n<p>The Armour of Frozen Tears is sky blue in colour, and in form unlike any other armour, though it somewhat resembles a flowing plate mail. The is no crest on the armour, nor any other sign, and, contradicting a then common legend, it can be worn by anyone, as was obvious after Mikhael the jester put it on during a festival. The armour also doesn’t prevent its wearer from being beheaded, which was also proven by said jester and the bodyguard of the enraged tsar. ‘To put on the frozen tears’ is now a common proverb for a daunting deed that went horribly wrong.</p>\n<p>The Armour of Frozen Tears is kept in the @UUID[.LGCNFtJ4cWlq0HjE#divine-quarter]{Sophianeum} and on display there, constantly guarded by a watch of honour.</p>\n<h3>The Tombstone of Bojar Pjotr</h3>\n<p>The Tombstone of Bojar Pjotr, build from marble and engraved with silver letters, describes the birth- and death-days of the Bojar Pjotr, who was known for his racial tolerance, and his bride, an unnamed Othyugh, who ate him at their wedding ceremony before being killed by the guests. Since that day the tombstone is used to promote racial purism, to be an outstanding example of foolish behaviour, to always come armed to a wedding and for lots of other more or less sensible things. But over the years the jokes gradually went sour, for even as Pjotr didn’t leave any relatives, the tombstone is always polished, and fresh flowers do appear next to it on the day of his birth, the day of both deaths and on a third day, which is supposed to be the birthing day of the proud bride. In later years a small fence was build around the tombstone, and now lovers faced with huge obstacles throw a flower inside the fenced area, where they lie fresh long after that should be possible, only to vanish without trace when another flower is thrown inside. It is known that the burden of the lovers is eased in some minor way as long as their flower is inside the fence, and that each pair of lovers may only throw one flower for this boon. Should there be no major obstacle to the love, or a second flower be thrown, then their flower withers away immediately, without replacing the last one, and bad luck is guaranteed for a month and a day. It also seems to matter what flower is chosen, a rose having other effects than a lily for instance, but that may be coincidence. Nonetheless there have been desperate lovers who went searching for a @UUID[JournalEntry.ismpCNWpGHvB1iPw.JournalEntryPage.w79VOo3UeUGraouv#winterflower]{Winterflower}, a rare wildflower supposed to grow in the northern mountains near the outpost of @UUID[JournalEntry.ismpCNWpGHvB1iPw]{Rybalka}, to better their chances for success.</p>\n<h3>Cold Iron Gate</h3>\n<p>The Cold Iron Gate is the impressive relict of a great effort to defeat the @UUID[JournalEntry.QlctNkzE9injOde9.JournalEntryPage.ei36LjIhEoh87vgE]{elves} and their fey allies once and for all. There is much disagreement about the details of the plan, but most sages agree that all walls and gates of @UUID[.dwAJ5Jtc6ii8zQoh]{Mohkba} were planned to be coated in cold iron. There are many different opinions about details though, if every town of the realm was to be coated in cold iron, and if the cold iron was meant to hold the fey outside or trap them inside instead. There is even a discussion if the elves themselves were hampered by cold iron in those ancient days, since they clearly aren’t in modern times. Whatever it is, after one gate was ready the whole plan was stopped due to lack of money. In modern days the Gate is infamous on the one hand, leading to the proverb of ‘he even has a cold iron toilet’ for someone with too much money, but oddly something of pride also, for it was a very ambitious project to say the least, and even unfinished its a symbol for Mohkba aiming very high. The Cold Iron Gate itself is somewhat barren, there are no gravels, signs or whatever in it, and has a dull blue colour that has appeared over time, since old texts describe the gate as being the colour of a grey stormcloud. Watchmen tell that the Cold Iron Gate is easier to close and to open then other gates of equal size. No invader has ever tried to break this gate down, so the ultimate test for the defensive attributes has not happened yet.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>Arcane Quarter</h2>\n<p> </p>\n<img style=\"float:right;margin:0px 15px 15px 0px;border:0px\" src=\"modules/aaw-games-aventyr/Setting-images/Wizard-with-Golem.webp\" width=\"252\" height=\"346\" />\n<p>The Arcane quarter is the only part of Mohkba without religious buildings. Not contend with lonely wizardly towers, the arcane wielders of Mohkba combined their resources to build the emerald fortress in the then Arcane suburb, now known as the somewhat infamous Fortress of the Arcane Arts. This fortress was mentioned in chronicles as early as five years after the foundation of the Sophianeum. The present walls and towers were constructed in a single night 200 years later. The central building of the emerald fortress is the four-domed college of Mutamateria, nicknamed ‘Transformation Cathedral’ to the chargrin of the clerics. The walls of the college are separated by pilasters with zakomari that were adorned with painting as far back as the 4th century after its foundation. The pinnacle of architecture when it was erected has a grandiose size and sensational shape, with eight cupolas, one for each school of magic, dazzling with luxury and an abundance of tiles, brick patterns and frescos. It is a real encyclopedia of arcane scenes which has no equivalent in Klavekian art. Today it is also connected with, or somewhat has overgrown, the Alchemists College, with is now part of the emerald fortress.</p>\n<h2>King’s Fortress</h2>\n<img style=\"float:right;margin:0px 15px 15px 0px;border:0px\" src=\"modules/aaw-games-aventyr/Setting-images/elizabethan-costumes-3.jpg\" width=\"270\" height=\"288\" />\n<p>The King’s Fortress was closely related to all the most important events in the life of ancient Mohkba: hosting foreign embassies, seeing-off warriors to fight the enemy, convening meetings of the Crown’s Advisors. Many centuries ago, the whole fortress was surrounded by ramparts, on which stood strong log walls and fortress towers. They served as reliable protection during the internecine wars of the Klavekian princes, but were later burned by Vikmordere invaders. Today, in a much safer age, nothing but a high wall remains.</p>\n<p>In addition to the above-mentioned Sophianeum, the King’s Fortress also features other striking monuments as the Faceted Palace – a rare specimen of elven architecture, built in the times of Vassily Elf-Friend jointly with elven masters, as well as the impressive and beautiful bellfry with a set of adamantit bells. In the central square of the King’s Fortress stands the monument “The Millenium of Klavek”, designed by Quincov the Stout and erected a bit prematurely 940 years after the foundation of Klavek by Tsar Alexei the Impatient. This unique document in bronze immortalizes all those who greatly contributed to the development of the country: its culture, science, art and literature, but also its tsars and war-heroes. The klavekian special political structure, spiritual freedom and territorial independence were highly favorable to the evolution of culture and art, and this is justly celebrated in the political heart of Klavek. Mohkba is one of the greatest art centers of the human world. Its architectural traditions, skaldic tales, school of icon-painting, jeweler’s and decorative applied art became famous all over the known world. Mohkba also is Klavekia’s major center of literacy and book production. As far back as the foundation years, by the will of the great Prince Yuri Dvagaslov himself, Mohkba saw the first school to train three hundred children at a time.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h3>The Emerald Casket</h3>\n<p>Once only known to a selected few trusted advisors of the Tsar, @UUID[.LGCNFtJ4cWlq0HjE#the-bridge-that-is-there-and-not-there]{ The Bridge That Is There And Not} There is supposed to be not the only legacy of Grigory Rivalnov. During the Time of Troubles a group of mercenaries took hold of the @UUID[.LGCNFtJ4cWlq0HjE#kings-fortress]{King’s Fortress} for a short time, and from these originated what is now a common legend. Deep under the King’s Fortress there’s an emerald casket, presumably holding the last of the Sinner Tsars in suspension, until a time where the lineage of Tsars is broken. There are some facts contradicting this tale, as the lineage of Tsars has been broken a few times in the past (most famously after the death of Tsarina Anna in 1143) and suspension doesn’t sound like illusionist magic, but still the legend persists. The Casket itself is rumored to be a huge emerald, hence the name, with a vague ageless male human shape enclosed in it. While nobody reliable has set her eyes on the casket in recent decades and talked about it, there are nonetheless many works of art depicting it in the city, even one monument in @UUID[.LGCNFtJ4cWlq0HjE#mariners-quarter]{Mariner’s Quarter}. Those works vary in many details from each other though, and there are ongoing and somewhat heated discussions which one looks more like the famous original.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>Trade-yard</h2>\n<p>On the opposite bank of the river, reachable by a footbridge, is Beatricov’s Court and the ancient Trade-yard, displaying many still-standing monuments of the early days of Klavek, all reminiscent of the busy trade life of Mohkba in the days before the Vikmordere Wars. Originally made of wood, it was almost completely destroyed by fire. Later new walls with defensive towers were erected. Not surprisingly, the symbol of the Trade-yard is a stone fortress, surrounded by an even more ancient earthen wall.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<img style=\"float:right;margin:0px 15px 15px 0px;border:0px\" src=\"modules/aaw-games-aventyr/Setting-images/237-The-Butcher-Newport-Market-Alley.jpg\" width=\"258\" height=\"233\" />\n<p>Nearly every house in the Trade-yard has a unique history and the central part of the quarter is one big architectural complex. The Beatricovan trading gallery is one of the biggest complexes in Klavekia. The layout is based on the plan of a typical merchant’s shop with trading on the ground floor and storage rooms in the attic and cellar. Rumors place the home of Klavek’s Thieves Guild here, but surely the Tsar’s Inquisitors would have ferreted this out long ago if there was any truth to the rumor.</p>\n<p>The most famous monument of the Trade-yard certainly is the Cube of Names for the most famous warrior-heroes of the first days of Mohkba, the greatest clerics, summoners, magi and oracles. The lower side on which the cube rests is supposed to show the names of rogues, the tsar’s under-hand, hidden even in the present. In the Trade-yard the ancient contracts are still stored, including such world-famous items as a great number of birch-bark scrolls and lead seals dating back to the founding years. These are indicative of a unique and striking level of literacy among ancient klavekians who were certainly and contrary to elven prejudices no barbarians at all and had a highly organized system of state control from the beginning.</p>\n<h3>The Hundred Candle Steps</h3>\n<p>When Yevgeni VI. married the elven lady Arianna Greenleaf in 692 his bride did make a grand entrance into @UUID[.dwAJ5Jtc6ii8zQoh]{Mohkba}. The last hundred steps of hers before she kissed the Tsar for the first time left footprints on the street, and immediatly after her delicate feet left the street a single cobblestone in each footprint went into tiny flames. Those flames still burn, a small but bright yellow light, unless @UUID[.ulLkhApELbg08M4o]{Klavek} is at war with the elves, when the flames change colour to blue.</p>\n<p>The flames may be extinguished easily, but they reflame on their own after a few minutes. They are unaffected by normal wind. The street were they are located is the street of the candlemakers and other trades who can use the handy open flames for their trade. It is one of the few tolerated displays of magic in the town since a rampaging troll could be stopped with help of these flames many years ago.</p>\n<h3>The Grand Scales</h3>\n<p>The @UUID[.LGCNFtJ4cWlq0HjE#trade-yard]{Trade-yard} has seen its share of good trades and bad trades, but also of frauds and con artists. Tsar Ironhand has had enough of that one day after his custom officers were cheated on a stormy night with a wooden block coated in gold and he commissioned the building of the Grand Scale, which is the height of a small building and able to weigh up to two tons of raw material. Its difficult and time consuming to handle, but very accurate and gives a +2 to appraise checks for raw materials. Rumours say that both the con artist and the custom officers are all part of the scale now, having been turned into the construction by magic or melted together with the iron from which is was built. In stormy nights they are rumoured to still wail for the tsars mercy.</p>\n<h2>Carpenter’s Quarter</h2>\n<p>Like every other separated part of Mohkba Carpenter’s Quarter has its own wall. The main gate connecting Carpenter’s quarter to the King’s Fortress has a famous décor on the outside, comprising three monumental tile compositions: To the right of the southern portal is a round bas-relief depicting Prince Yaroslav the Witch and under the arches of the side facades are two scenes of workers laboring. These unique ancient Klavekian tiles date back to first century after the foundation.</p>\n<p>The other way into this quarter is Nikolsky Gate. Behind it is the small “bridge of happiness,” hung with padlocks. At the edges of the bridge are two horseshoes of a centaur, one of which reads: “Eternal Love” in the language of the horsefolk. Holding hands, lovers go through the large horseshoe and walk on the eight small ones on the bridge. According to legend, a female centaur ambassador broke its horseshoe here on a stone, being dazzled by the sight of a Klavekian cavalry officer. To this day the “stone of desires” sits close to the bridge.</p>\n<p>Despite its name, Carpenter’s quarter has long been famous for its furriers and shoemakers. On the streets are a lot of wooden houses, stone mansion from the end of the century before last, as well as trading arcades new and preserved.</p>\n<p>Carpenter’s quarter is also known for its Abandoned Monastry, a building which stands empty for about 300 years now. Here False Yuri II (Grishka Raulyev) met the nun Tatyana, the widow of Alexei IV, Maria Poterowa, who had entered the monastery. She recognized the pretender as her son, Yuri. This was the trigger for the Troubles, an euphemistic name for one of the meanest of the Klavekian civil wars. Due to that sad part of Klavekian history the monastery is empty now, but still a fantastic sight. In the old days, in the minds of the people, the greatness of a monastery was always connected to the height of its belltower. The architectural center of the Carpenter’s Quarter is one of the highest belltowers in Klavekia, more than 89 meters high. Monumental and steadfast, it does not look overly heavy because of its many columns, wide arched openings and decoration, which contains Alexei’s monograms. The dome of the seven-storied belltower is decorated with the imperial crown – the monastry had always been under the special patronage of the tsars. On the orders of Metropolitan Vladimir, 8 bells were cast for it, including “The Bear”, the largest bell in Mohkba. Each has its own tone, but all together they allow the ringer to create a perfect harmonic composition, a gem of world cultural heritage, the Mohkba chimes. When the angels first heard it legend claimed they cried, creating the lake of Mohkba. Since the Troubles the bells are silent and refuse to ring, a sign that toppled the claim of false Yuri II more than anything else. Countless priests and magicians have tried to revive the chime since those days to no avail. Standing near “The Bear” they could only enjoy the stunning views of the river and the Bridge of Happiness across it.</p>\n<p>The boundless forests outside Mohkba behind the bridge are equally beautiful in summer as in winter, in morning as in evening. Mohkba and Mohkba region have long been intensely cultivated by man, perhaps more than any other region of Klavekia. Yet nature still occupies a huge part of it with clean lakes and rivers, and wild forests. It is hard to believe, but today forests still cover a huge part of Mohkba region, and with some luck one can still see wild animals looking from the belltower. One should take care though, the monastry is neglected and the stairs are somewhat unsafe.</p>\n<h3>The Bridge That Is There And Not There</h3>\n<p>Grigorij Rivalnov was the greatest Illusionist Mohkba has known in its long history, living in the days of the Sinner Tsars. It is told that once, at the 25th birthday of Tsar Anatol V., he changed the whole capital so that it looked like covered in molted gold, sparkling in the sunrise. Another story is not that beautiful, telling a tale where the Illusionist came to the Tsarina in the night disguised by foul magic to resemble the Tsar. Whether that tale is true or not, it was used against the Tsarevitch during the civil war after the death of Anatol V., claiming the young prince to be a wizard’s bastard. It was one of the many reasons why magic is so distrusted in Klavek up to the present time.</p>\n<p>Be the stories true or false, most of Rivalnov’s illusion have been banned or timed out over the long years since his death, save for the famous Bridge That Is There And Not There, or Rivalnov’s Bridge. It looks like a sturdy stone bridge, including small statues of famous citizens of Mohkba from the time where it was cast, most prominent among them the tsar and tsarina (but not the tsarevitch) in the middle of it. The bridge is famous enough that most people of Klavek know its an illusion, but nonetheless whoever attemps to cross it for the first time has to make a will save. If she fails, she is able to cross it for the rest of her life, even inside a carriage if every other passenger and the horses failed also. If she succeeds, she falls straight through the illusion and most likely takes a cold bath in the river. Most citizens of Mohkba are able to cross the bridge freely, having failed their save as children when they still believed in wonders.</p>\n<p>Of course its a common prank among teenagers to guide foreigners over the bridge, telling them about the illusion while doing so and laughing the moment the strangers take a bath.</p>\n<h3>The Unprotected Ruby</h3>\n<p>On a plaza in the midst of @UUID[.LGCNFtJ4cWlq0HjE#carpenters-quarter]{Carpenter’s Quarter} is an ebony pedestal with a flawless fist-sized red ruby on it. It is not protected by any means, and in fact has been stolen four times already, but always was returned in a week at most. It is obviously worth a fortune, should someone find a buyer for it, but doing that is the difficult part. Tied to the ruby is bad luck of the gravest sort, so most who did ever handle it for more than a few hours died horribly, and no one has managed to break that curse, if it is a curse at all. If the gem is returned to the pedestal all is well again, save for some scars, wounds or broken bones from the time of possessing the gem, but no unusual bad luck happens again. Sages have wondered about the properties of the Unprotected Ruby for long, and examined it – usually from afar – but no one knows its secret. Legend claims one tsar or another, the details vary, paid tribute to the @UUID[JournalEntry.QlctNkzE9injOde9.JournalEntryPage.I4CpK8rTs0HgD7hW]{Vikmordere} with this specially prepared gem, to weaken the enemy by cursing their leaders, but the gem had been returned after some time or never delivered at all after killing its maker in a weird accident which centered around a goose, a flower and a nail.</p>\n<h3>Watching Torches</h3>\n<p>In the Street of the Eye, where once the royal treasury was located, is one of the few magical features of Mohkba of the divine nature. Dating back to the years of Pjotr the Pius in ancient times the Grand Robbery of the treasury shook @UUID[.dwAJ5Jtc6ii8zQoh]{Mohkba} to the core. Pjotr did pray to the Guardian God for help against further occurences of this kind, and some claim that he could do not much else but pray after being poor like a goblin thanks to the thieves. Be this as it may, the street once leading to the treasury has magical torches to this day. They catch fire the moment an intelligent creature comes in 40 feet of them, and they sputter out with no one in the vicinity any longer. It was a very efficient warning system until the Second Great Robbery of the treasury which was committed with the help of golems. After the @UUID[JournalEntry.QlctNkzE9injOde9.JournalEntryPage.I4CpK8rTs0HgD7hW]{Vikmordere} plundered the treasury twice, each time illuminated by torchlight, it was relocated to a more secure location, and today wonderworkers, con artists and charlatans have their shops in the torchlit street, to the chargrin of many clerics. They sell everything, from splinters of the true bowl that graced the Empty Pedestal once, enough of them to build a glass dome over @UUID[.dwAJ5Jtc6ii8zQoh]{Mohkba} as the critics claim, to bones of the Sinner Tsars or the head of the Vikmordere chieftain Angus the Old from the days when he was still a child. Sometimes true magic can be found here, so its a place visited by many for its sense of wonder and promises.</p>\n<h3>The Floating Tower</h3>\n<p>When Klavek was young and mostly build of wood two rival families had a feud with each other that slowly escalated. One night the tower of one of the families was put to the torch by its rival, and the ground burned to ashes – but the ground only. The tower is still there to this day, the only wooden tower of this height in the town, but it has no first floor. Indeed it floats from the second floor up, but it stays in place no matter the wind. It was even inhabitat a while afterwards, but with the distrust in magic growing the family that owned it later moved away and now is rumoured to have left no inheritors. There have been some attempts in the past to remove or destroy the floating tower, but none did succeed so far. Today the floating tower is protected by the military, mostly to prevent hotheads from another attempt to burn it – along with the rest of the town while trying.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>Mariner’s quarter</h2>\n<p>Mariner’s quarter is the underbelly of @UUID[.dwAJ5Jtc6ii8zQoh]{Mohkba}, known for its cheap brothels and ramshackle pubs. But even in this bad place is a national icon to be found, the Navy Museum, a colorful painted wooden house. It exhibits the wooden boat, great-grandfather of Klavekia’s navy, that was sent out on the water of the Lake of Angelic Tears by the young Tsar Alexei III. Sadly that’s the only thing exhibited in the whole museum.</p>\n<p>According to legend, there was a stone idol standing in what is now the Mariner’s quarter that the ancient centaurs worshiped. The hermit Natalya prayed and received a magical staff from a divine elk with which she destroyed the idol, and then built a church on the site of the pagan shrine. Before going to fight the Vikmordere, Tsar Alexei the Twin made a pilgrimage to the monastery to take the staff of Natalya. After the battle of the Serpent, the tsar in gratitude built a cathedral where the church stood, one of the first multi-altar churches, which have additional altars dedicated to different gods. The interior of this cubic six-domed church is unusual: The arches are supported by five pillars, which gives the effect of volume. It could justifiably be called the pearl of that period of Klavekian architecture and its domes, walls, door frames and all other available surfaces are full of mural paintings. In modern days the cathedral is seldom visited, and but the altar of the gods dedicated to the sea and to long voyages is cleaned regularly. The staff of Natalya is rumored to have inspired Tarissov the Leprous in building the first @UUID[.1hMoSKS1OqlchIwq#the-blank-staffs]{Blank Staff}. This made his treason the more unbearable and added to the neglect of the Church of Natalya’s Staff.</p>\n<h3>The Empty Pedestal</h3>\n<p>In the Harbour area stands the famous Empty Pedestal, by itself a rather blank structure with no artistic value whatsoever, but in ancient time Leo II, The Tsar in the Bowl, had his crystal home on this pedestal overlooking the harbour and looking for outside help to break his curse. Its not clear who cursed him or why, and tales blame everyone from the Vikmordere, the clerics, the magicians to his own relatives for the vile deed. His grandson did break the bowl in 173, not wanting to be a mere regent as his father has been, thereby killing the tsar or what was left of him and provoking a short civil war known as the days of the Cleared Succession or the days of the Murdering Tsar by his enemies. The infamous victory speech by Tsar Leo IV was held standing on the very pedestal that held his grandfather for so many decades, and it was one of the longest and most winding speeches in the history of Mohkba, rumoured to have crashed the last resistance to his rule by boring all dissidents to death. Leo IV was known as the chattering tsar or the shattering tsar for many decades until Tsar Anatol VIII decided the matter almost 150 years later by naming Leo IV the Tsar who Broke the Bowl. Until today the people of Mohkba express their feelings toward the government by placing various fishes on the empty pedestal, each of them with a different meaning. Knowing which fish means what is a science in itself and a riddle to even many people of Mohkba, let alone foreign guests. Most governments see any fish in any position and any state of decay as an insult to them nowadays, which lets the pedestal been guarded most of the time and certainly when government is cutting public spending or raising taxes.</p>\n<h3>Dancing Skeleton</h3>\n<p>Once during the many wars with the Vikmordere a regiment of Klavekian archers managed to surprise a ritual by the Vikmordere. Suspecting a vile purpose of this ritual the archers peppered everyone attending in the grove, slaying everyone – almost. When the storm of arrows ceased, only the leading shaman was still on his feet and dancing, amidst a sea of dead. The next volley of arrows hit him exclusively, but, even being obviously dead, the dance continued. The Klavekian were scared, but took the shaman captive, without getting any response from him. Even bound he twitched in his dance moved with vacant, dead eyes. Back in Mohkba the shaman was showered with positive energy to no avail and ultimately thrown in a pool of acid, where his flesh receded, but his skeleton still danced. It was bound again and put away in a deep cell.</p>\n<p>An unknown number of decades later Tsar Alexei V., later called the ‘Mad Tsar’, decided to bolster morale of the citizens by putting the shaman on display. So the skeleton dances on a pedestal, at first closely watched by clerics and guards, but these days only by an honour guard of veterans of Klavekian skirmishes or battles with the Vikmordere. Oddly enough the few Vikmordere ambassadors that have visited Mohkba and seen the shaman have been reported to not be offended by the sight, but smiling knowingly, which unsettled more than one of the veterans guarding the Dancing Skeleton. But since the skeleton is dancing for more than 250 years by now and nothing visibly bad has come out of it yet, the citizens of Mohkba see the Dancing Skeleton as nothing more than a celebrated oddity, a trophy of war and a symbol of the weirdness of their Vikmordere neighbors.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h3>Spitting Statue</h3>\n<p>At the harbour of @UUID[.dwAJ5Jtc6ii8zQoh]{Mockba} is the statue of Dimitrij Denisonovitch, most honoured advisor to Tsar Pjotr the Diplomat and, for a very short time, of his successor Alexei the Twin. Denisonovitch is portrait as an especially ugly man, with an evil looking face, a long hook-like nose and a hunchback. It is well known that he featured none of this in his life, having been a rather handsome and charismatic man, but he counseled his Tsars toward accepting surrender and tribute to the Vikmordere, like Mohkba paid to the Saatman Empire before. His statue was erected to remember the people of the price of betrayal, for Denisonovitch was beheaded on the very first day of the reign of Alexei the Twin in 1096 for this craven council, and until this day passerby spit on the statue as their sign of national pride. There are rumours though that before 1096 there had been another statue of Denisonovitch, built by Pjotr the Diplomat for former successes of his councellor, showing the real self with a concerned face, and some people did cut themselves in front of this statue of Denisonovitch to let a drop of blood or two spill at his feet, for in the first battles of the Twin’s war theVikmordere claimed much blood of Mohkba and won most of them. Denisonovitchs council seemed wiser those days, but with the shifting tides of war and victory increasingly favouring Mohkba the old statue was toppled and later replaced by the new and ugly one, and today a different body fluid is offered to the advisor that failed from grace.</p>\n<h3>Statue of the Shamans</h3>\n<p>In the Vikmordere wars, Mohkba was frequently plundered, at least in parts, but at one time the Vikmordere tried to stay to conquer the town of their enemies once and for all. Chieftain Angus the Old died shortly after this decision, many claiming being struck down by the gods for his decision, and the Vikmordere went away to being splintered tribes as before. But a relic from those days is the statue of ice, vaguely build like a sea snake, was left behind by the Vikmordere. It still is in the @UUID[.LGCNFtJ4cWlq0HjE#mariners-quarter]{Mariner’s Quarter} as a warning from the Vikmordere threat, an oddity from times long past, and a part of the city defences. The serpent statue has a faint glimmer of conjuration magic. If touched and used as a focus component during the casting of summon swarm, summon monster or summon nature’s ally, and the spell is used to summon a serpent swarm or giant serpent, the spell lasts for an additional round, and, in the case of a summoned swarm, the swarm does not attack the caster, so long as he retains hold of the statue, allowing him to stand freely in the area of the swarm. The statue provides no such protection against serpent swarms conjured by others or encountered normally.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>Gardener’s quarter</h2>\n<p>On the Gardener’s quarter’s central square, Natalyaskaya Ploshchad, stands a monument in honor of the hermit Natalya. Natalyaskaya Ploshchad practically runs into another square, named after Yuri Sansurov who sacrificed his life for the sake of young tsar Alexei the Twin. Outside Gardener’s Quarter is Chistoye Boloto, the clean bog, into which Sansurov led the Vikmordere who had come to capture the Klavekian tsar, there by sacrifying himself for his tsar.</p>\n<p>The Gardener’s quarter has an elk farm in honor of Natalya the hermit. This is one of the few places in the world where druids have been successfully breeding elks for 90 years now. Pilgrims can not only take a good look at the elks but interact with them too. Trying elk milk is an absolute must since it has an unusual flavor and is known to grant divine favors every few years.</p>\n<p>There are about 15 gardens and parks in the Gardener’s quarter alone. A favorite recreation spot is the pine wood within its center. Here is the Klavekian Calling celebrated, the traditional custom for greeting the spring, calling the elks and the warming sun. Its on a small but long hill with a spring near its top, and in winter few children can resist the temptation to slide down the frozen slippery slope on their backsides or on sledges. The spring is also famous throughout Mohkba for its water purity.</p>\n<p>There are more than 13 bridges in the quarter. Many artisans come here for inspiration, which visitors are reminded of by monuments to writers, painters and druids that decorate gardens, parks and promenades. In the warm season there are six fountains in the squares and parks leading to ponds, little waterfalls and a boulder three-span bridge decorated with a unique carved iconostasis of rose, walnut and birch.</p>\n<p>Gardeners quarter was once the private property of the son of a simple Gardener. In childhood he fled from his father to a neighboring village, where he lived with the priest and sang in church. His beautiful voice drew the attention of a major who was driving by, who took the boy and brought him to Mohkba, to the delight of the tsarina, Tatjana Valakova, who loved his beautiful singing. The 22-year-old ‘voice of an angel’ became involved with the princess Anna Alexeievna. After she became tsarina, she awarded her lover some property and the rank of general, marrying him in secret. The influence wielded by this favorite of the tsarina became colossal, as did his wealth and land ownership. However, Gregory the Gardener remained throughout a modest and pious man, who financed the construction of many churches and always viewed his exalted status with humor. Later, when offering an explanation for Anna’s choice, one of her nieces recalled Gregory as one of the most beautiful men she had met in her whole life. After his death he dedicated his beloved garden to the people of Mohkba, to be tended by druids, and thus Gardener’s Quarter was founded and named after him.</p>\n<h2>Zveni Island</h2>\n<p>The Mohkba Lake’s individual shape can be explained by its glacial origins. It is in fact several lakes, joined to each other by short narrow canals, stretching in a chain from west to east for 50 kilometers. At its eastern end, at the mouth of Serpent Tail River, is Zveni Island. Its thus far away from the capital, but Alexei the Twin deemed it so important that he named it part of the capital itself, and that was never changed. The decision made Mohkba the biggest town of the world, at least if one measures size by east-west miles.</p>\n<p>On the remote Zveni island a monastery had been built, which today is connected with the mainland by bridge. In the early days of the empire a hermit called Gregory settled on the island. He was given the nickname Stolbensky, from the word “stolb” meaning pillar. After his death, fame spread far and wide of his the healing power, and the monastery became a center of pilgrimage, one of the largest in Klavekia. Not many years later an unique ensemble came together, and today the monastery comprises seven churches and 30 buildings in the tradition of Mohkba architecture. The shores of the island were reinforced with granite embankments. The monastery became a veritable “city of clerics,” a little part of Mohkba by some miracle abandoned in the wilderness of the region.</p>\n<p>As told in a legend, Zveni got its name, ‘bell-tolling’, thanks to its bells, which rang out for hundreds of miles around. When neighboring villages heard them, they also began to sound the alarm by tolling bells, and so on until the signal reached Mohkba, warning the capital of the kingdom of the approach of the Vikmordere enemy. Thus, Zverni was destroyed many times, and rebuilt after every attack. The Tsars did this in part out of piety, in part out of military thoughts and in part because the island became sort of a repository for unwanted wives and daughters and politically dangerous persons of both genders. To die on the island is said to grant a dying limited wish, but it has to be worded carefully and can’t have a political or military approach, for the first tsar who had died on the island, Gregory the Other Twin, also known as the Shortlived, had wished it so.</p>\n<p>Entry to the monastery is through two arches, one of which stands at the bridge, and the other at the pier. Rebuilt only a few years ago, it nonetheless is famous for its rich decoration of klavekian baroque and frescoes in the style of oreadean masters. The main hall is bright and spacious with four pillars that bear arches. On the walls are two thematic series: seven paintings depicting the various battles with the Vikmordere and four illustrating the Miracles of Gregory Stolbensky.</p>\n<p>Water clarity in this part of the lake can be up to 5 meters. The lake is inhabited by about 20 species of fish, including smelt, bream, perch, burbot, whitefish, ide and pike, but also the occasional sea serpent. The forests are rich with game and poultry. There is a park on the shore, overlooking the lake, and a cape in the south of the island is covered with meadows. On the very point of the headland is a snow-white church which has miraculously survived the last two Vikmordere attacks unharmed.</p>\n</div>","markdown":""},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"sort":700000,"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}},{"name":"Klavekian Grasslands","type":"text","_id":"J642N3NDDUewmTFn","title":{"show":false,"level":1},"image":{},"text":{"format":1,"content":"<div class=\"aventyr\"><p class=\"s5\">Klavekian Grasslands</p><h2>Weather</h2><p>The winters on the Klavekian Grasslands last seven to nine months. Temperatures vary from −40 °C to 36 °C throughout the year. The summers are short but sometimes even hot, with plant life exploding as to make up for a whole year in but a few weeks.</p><p>The grassy plains in the Klavekian lowlands are a very windy area, with winds often blowing upwards of 40–90 km/h. It lies on top of permanently frozen soil called permafrost.</p><p>During the spring, the permafrost thaws just enough to let plants grow and reproduce. The ground below it stays frozen though, so the water can’t sink low, and so forms the streams, lakes and marshes found during the snowless months.</p><p>Rivers of the Klavekian Grassland flow over the same permafrost, so they erode their banks rather than the bottoms. They usually consist of countless channels, and can be difficult to cross. Most of them dry out after the end of the thawing period, leaving not many traces behind them until the next spring.</p><p>Most of the permanent rivers freeze to the bottom in some places. Water breaks the ice and then freezes on top of it. These ice plugs, called naled in the region, often don’t melt until the next autumn. If this happens on the important Serpent Tail River, which connects the @UUID[.ulLkhApELbg08M4o]{Klavekian mainlands} to the @UUID[JournalEntry.ismpCNWpGHvB1iPw.JournalEntryPage.Erya8w29cRTTJELu]{Serpent Lake}, it’s a major obstacle for trade, so the government sends spellcasters to remove these dangers by magical fire. Travel is not easy in these times of the year, and sometimes there are casualties in spite of the government efforts. Locals want the magicians to be permanently located near their villages, or at least for the duration of winter, but that has not been ordered so far despite of the protests.</p><p></p><h2>Flora</h2><p>As soon as the snow melts, the “Klavekian Pervenets” (The Firstborn) grows up thickly around the rivers and lakes. This huge grassy plant announces the start of the growing season after the winter is gone. Its juice has a sweet taste, but leaves blisters and sores on the skin that ache for months and has a 50% chance of lowering the dexterity score by one point until healed. The people of the three villages extract a form of sweet sugar out of it, and also distill wine that produces wonderful dreams after just one or two glasses. The dreams can carry portents sometimes; there is a 5% chance per glass drunk, up to a maximum of 10%, that the drinker can cast augury like a caster of third level right after waking up, regardless of his real class level or even if she is no spellcaster at all. The augury may happen or not, but another side effect does always take place; in the morning the drinker feels miserable and is nauseated for the next three hours per glass imbibed. Strangely the wine distilled out of Klavekian Pervenets as well as the juice itself loses its potency after only three days, so transporting it to larger markets is a huge challenge.</p><p>Maybe even better known in Klavek is one kind of plant that appears shortly after the Firstborn, but keeps growing in huge patches until late autumn. Talgana is a truly giant herb that reaches up to 3,5ms in height, a remarkable example of the famously tall forms of Klavek flora. In autumn, the stems can hide a wooly rhino easily. Inside the thickets, the sun and skies are hidden by the broad leaves, and bears’ paths cleave the wall of stems like tunnels. Talgana’s leaves are soft and its stems are easy to move apart with hands or a stick. Its young sprouts are edible, so much so that for bears they are a remedy against hunger in the early summer when there are neither berries nor fish yet. In winter-time, with snow on their umbels, these giants look like exotic trees, and numerous stories for children link them to fairies, but such a link is not proven by sages. They finally cave-in under their white burden when winter takes its course.</p><p>Aside from these endemic plants, this region supports numerous other species of rare flora, particularly grasses, herbs and shrubs. These shrublands are difficult to cross and full of bugs and other insects in summer, but they are a much better place than the neighboring regions for surviving the winter. A lot of wildlife uses them as shelter.</p><h2>Fauna</h2><p>One of the world’s largest herds of moose breeds in the Klavekian Grasslands, and there are three kinds of elk living here, from the smaller normal elks up to the river elk and then onto the megaloceras, but all in all the region is known for its megafauna. Vast herds travel the flatland, most of them following the seasons by going north in spring and south in autumn. They are followed by their predators like the smilodons or ice trolls in most cases, but there are exceptions to the hunting techniques used by creatures such as this, as described in the next paragraph.</p><p>One of the greatest predators in the Grasslands is the addanc, which lives like a beaver and builds dams. When prey tries to cross the water in its territory, it attacks like a crocodile. The various oozes of the region, most notably the grey ooze, the glacial ooze and the white pudding, also tend to be lurking hunters. However, the king of the Grasslands is the one-eyed frostwurm, which even attacks herds of mammoth. It radiates cold, is 35 feet long and weighs 8,000 pounds.</p><p>Other strange hunters include the flightless Ahlinni-birds or the hunting parties of Mimi, the sole fairy of the Grasslands, which have their villages mostly in the nearby forest, but roam the plains for prey. Also on the plains are the fogwarden (spelt the same for singular and plurals), aberrations that look like fog taking a humanoid form. The sight of their ice blue eyes has doomed more than one adventurer who had seen herself as a predator, not prey.</p><p>Maybe the most unusual species for this environment is the Kolasuchus, an amphibian, because it is known for surviving deep freezes, as low as -35 to -40°C. In some cases Kolasuchi have been known to remain frozen in permafrost for years, and after thawing, just walking off.</p><h2>Lake Voltaran</h2><p>One of the few permanent lakes in the Klavekian Grassland is Lake Voltaran, an enormous flooded volcanic caldera where more than a million salmon gather and spawn every year. The water is warm and doesn’t freeze in winter due to volcanic activity or a quasi-dormant gate to the Elemental Plane of Fire, depending on what sage you are listening to. The lake is a lifesaver for many species in the dead of winter, prey or predator, but a hunting ground for very dangerous monsters also. Travelers are wise to avoid it if their lifes don’t depend on its warmth.</p></div>","markdown":""},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"sort":800000,"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}},{"name":"Klavekian Staffweaving","type":"text","_id":"1hMoSKS1OqlchIwq","title":{"show":false,"level":1},"image":{},"text":{"format":1,"content":"<div class=\"aventyr\"><p class=\"s5\">Klavekian Staffweaving</p><h2>The Blank Staffs</h2><p>When confronted with the strange @UUID[JournalEntry.QlctNkzE9injOde9.JournalEntryPage.I4CpK8rTs0HgD7hW]{Vikmordere} magic the traditional wizards of the @UUID[.ulLkhApELbg08M4o]{Klavekian Empire} were at first at a total loss. No one had ever seen such magic as the savage Northmenn could wield. The Vikmordere wouldn’t explain how they did it for obvious reasons and Vikmorere prisoners sooner died then shared tribal secrets. Explorers sent to neighboring lands came back empty handed also.</p><p>Finally, Tarissov the Leprous, Magister of the Klavekian Academie of Magical Arts, came forth with a solution for at least part of the problem. He invented the famous Blank Staffs, magical tools to not only explore foreign magic, but to steal its secrets to a degree. When a spellcaster is hit with a Blank Staff she loses a prepared spell to it. The owner of the Blank Staff can then use the stolen spell. Strangely, when the user of a Blank Staff would be able to cast the stolen spell on its own, the magic vanished, but leaving the Blank Staff rechargeable once more. In the times when the Blank Staff was invented, those magic has not vanished at all, but been transferred to Tarissov the Leprous himself, who in this way became mightier and mightier. Finally, he felt strong enough to challenge the tsar himself, but he overestimated his abilities and was finally slain after what is known as the War Without Faces. Where the magic of a Blank Staffs vanishes now is uncertain, some speculate that Tarissov the Leprous isn’t dead at all, still accumulating power, other say the magic simply dripples away.</p><p>The magic needed to create Blank Staffs went to the grave with Tarissov the Leprous and is lost. But since the traitor-magician wanted the Blank Staffs to be spread wide he produced great amounts of them and sold them cheaply in what was viewed as a patriotic act those days. The Blank Staffs aren’t cheap anymore, but still readily available on the Magical Fair, charged or uncharged. Buyers have to beware though, there are Blank Staffs staffs with magic in them that no one can use, since the user has to be able to understand the magic in the staff on principle. An arcane specialist can’t used a stolen divine spell. The Vikmordere do have something entirely different sometimes, the so called mosaic magic. Only rarely are staffs with mosaic magic useable by any non-Vikmordere in Klavek.</p><h2>Empty Staffs</h2><p>While the magic to create @UUID[.1hMoSKS1OqlchIwq#the-blank-staffs]{Blank Staffs} is lost, the general art of staffbinding has made strides in @UUID[.ulLkhApELbg08M4o]{Klavek}. In these days it is possible to create staffs that are empty in their own ways. The procedure of creating them is expensive and time consuming, but also very flexible. The exact method is a guarded secret of the Klavekian Academie of Magical Arts, but the effect is, when a buyer wants a specific staff, he has to pay an extra amount of money equal 20%, but gets his staff in but 24 hours, for the raw Empty Staff had been prepared in advance. Since other nations still use methods that take a hundred days to produce an individual staff, Klavek’s magicians have a sharp competitive edge in emergencies or with clients not known for their patience. On the other hand, the Magical Fair is known to have most common staffs readily available to buy at normal costs if one spends some time searching, so Empty Staffs would usually be only required for exotic or rare inventions if it was just a matter of speed. With a successful DC 15 Spellcraft check the Empty Staff can be filled with additional magic for the usual fees (and 20%) by a skilled staffweaver, though a failed check makes the Empty Staff unusable for a full moon circle (a month). Empty Staffs are used for Bonded Objects or by wizards who don’t want to use an Efficient Quiver to sort through their magical staffs.</p><h2>Two Staff Weaving</h2><p>Klavekian spellcasters have perfected the art of fighting with staffs since Tarissov the Leprous days. Lukov the Fencer was the first magician to invent the art of Two Wand Weaving, and this feat is still popular in modern Klavek.</p></div>","markdown":""},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"sort":900000,"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}},{"name":"Lineage of Klavekian Tsars","type":"text","_id":"T3yjCTV19TztrWUu","title":{"show":false,"level":1},"image":{},"text":{"format":1,"content":"<div class=\"aventyr\"><p class=\"s5\">Lineage of Klavekian Tsars</p><ul><li><p><strong>About -520-490:</strong> Years of the Angry Sea, the Kraken terrorizes the eastern shores of what is today’s modern @UUID[.ulLkhApELbg08M4o]{Klavek}</p></li><li><p><strong>About -500:</strong> @UUID[.dwAJ5Jtc6ii8zQoh]{Mohkba} founded by Prince Yuri Dvagaslov, the Holy Knight of the Crossroad. @UUID[.LGCNFtJ4cWlq0HjE#divine-quarter]{The Sophianeum }is built in Mohkba, or, by a different account, the city is built where the Sophianeum already stood.

This magic, along with the town’s position on the river, may be why the town is as prosperous as it is.

The loremasters of this tale say that Nearru fashioned the stone and Jazoh cut through it as a mark of their union.</p>\n<p>The town itself is chaotic, disorganized, and, at times, barely functional. Holds up at the docks are not helped by Dockmaster Casta, who tries to get his greedy fingers into as many pies as possible. From charging unheard of (and obscenely high) “docking fees,” “cargo fees,” or “passenger fees,” that money goes straight into Casta’s pocket. Although there have been numerous complaints to Marshall Mulcahey, Casta has a complex system of how the docks are run that no one else understands and Tatiana came to the conclusion that hiring a new dockmaster and untangling everything at the docks would end up costing more than the town can afford, so she allows Casta to charge these fees, but talks with him occasionally about making sure some of those funds make their way to the city coffers.</p>\n<h2>Torrent</h2>\n<p><strong>Alignment and Type:</strong> True Neutral small town</p>\n<p><strong>Modifiers Crime:</strong> +1, Law -3, Lore +1, Society +4</p>\n<p><strong>Qualities:</strong> Academic, Notorious</p>\n<p><strong>Danger:</strong> 10</p>\n<p><strong>Disadvantages:</strong> –</p>\n<p><strong>Government:</strong> Magical</p>\n<p><strong>Population:</strong> 275</p>\n<p><strong>Notable NPCs:</strong> Matron Elizabeth Dunleavy, Daughter of Nature (CN, female, Klavek (human), Druid 11), Yugorg Daemonbreaker, Jailor (LN, male, ogre, Fighter 6)</p>\n<p><strong>Base Value and Purchase Limit:</strong> 1,300/7,500</p>\n<p><strong>Spellcasting:</strong> 6th</p>\n<p><strong>Minor Items</strong> 3d4; <strong>Medium Items</strong> 1d6; <strong>Major Items</strong> –</p>\n<p>Torrent, named for the increase in the speed of the where the two rivers join, is the “middle child” of the Three Sisters.

Separated from the other nations by the blasted deserts of the North, and the cliffsides overlooking the ocean to their East, the outside interferences within their growing culture were few and far in between. Developing a spiritual belief system that relies heavily upon the animal spirits around them, as well as the spirits of the moon and sun, and heavily practicing human sacrifice, the N’rcul experienced a true miracle, when, following the passing of a beloved ruler, their leader returned from the grave, restored to life, stronger and filled with the power of the spirits themselves. Kham-a-Tael rose from the grave ignorant of the world outside of his lands, knowing no more of the mysteries of the world then his people, and truly believed that he and only he had been chosen to return from the other side by the spirits, as a sign to his people, a sign that the spirits are listening, and they are watching.</p>\n<p>Kham-a-Tael’s rising sparked a religious fervor within his people, a renewed strength within the nations under his name, and renewed hope for the future of these lands. It was into these lands that a pair of undead were drawn, sensing the power of a newly awakened, and extremely powerful, undead, an unlikely pair of traveling companions (The Vampire Davional, and the @UUID[.mALZCj1Avtm347FY]{Lich Malakittal}). Presenting himself to The Risen Lord within his sleeping chambers, Davional set about establishing nightly visits with the curious undead lord, building a rapport, staying only long enough each night to make sure the interest was there, until the two had gotten familiar enough with each other that the talks got lengthier and lengthier, building to the point that Davional and Malakittal were given rooms within the temples to better accommodate them. It was through these late night conversations that Davional began to educate Kham-a-Tael as to what he believed him to be (a mummy), and several of the abilities demonstrated by Kham-a-Tael supported the theories of the cunning vampire.</p>\n<p>It was within these conversations that Davional laid the seeds for Kham-a-Tael’s mistrust of the outside world, and allowing outsiders to know of the miracle of his rebirth, and in friendship offered to both Davional and his companion Malakittal a permanent place of safety within his lands as well. Davional, realizing the possibility, took the offer a step further, and countered the offer with a safe means of utilizing the resources of the lands to make both his own and Kham-aTael’s people profitable, while guaranteeing that outside influences would be kept at bay. Davional offered to take the edges of NaeraCull for his own people, the Wandering Nation, forming a living buffer between the N’rcul and the outside world, and begin setting up trade with other nations and consortium’s for the natural resources of the rainforest, with the people’s of the wandering nation and the N’rcul supplying the work force, splitting labor between the materials being harvested. Convincing the Risen Lord that it was only a matter of time before a force to large to repel would arrive and begin harvesting resources against their will, it was only logical that they preemptively set up trade relations of their own. All connections were made from Davional’s people, and work began immediately on gathering the Wandering Nation and building them a home to call their own, as well as setting up mining sites, harvesting camps, and farms to utilize local fauna such as the cacao and several other rare herbs.</p>\n<p>Of all the materials available however, the desert offered up the strangest, in the form of raw glass. The deserts of NaeraCull lie within the path of the Scorched Lands, and as such are subjected to temperatures that fuse dunes of sand into glass on a regular basis. Organizing a workforce comprised of constructs, golems and undead all under the watchful eye of a handful of trusted subservient necromancers, Davional has turned the harvesting and export of glass into an extremely lucrative enterprise.</p>\n</div>","markdown":""},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{"core":{"sheetClass":""}}},{"sort":200000,"name":"Malakittal","type":"text","_id":"mALZCj1Avtm347FY","title":{"show":false,"level":1},"image":{},"text":{"format":1,"content":"<div class=\"aventyr\">\n<p class=\"s5\">Malakittal</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center\"><strong>Malakittal, the shadow behind the thrones</strong></p>\n<p> </p>\n<img style=\"float:right;margin:0px 15px 15px 0px;border:0px\" src=\"modules/aaw-games-aventyr/Setting-images/Malekittal-272x300.webp\" width=\"272\" height=\"300\" />\n<p>The Lich who had no desire to be, Malakittal was a cruel and selfish child, gifted with an abnormal intellect amongst his peers, but a complete lack of social grace. Sold into apprenticeship to an older wizard, Malakittal’s father was more than happy to watch his son disappear over the horizon. It was that devalued concept that hardened the heart and soul of the boy who would, within the next year, poison and slay his mentor, and flee into the night with a collection of his tomes. Hiding in the underbelly of a city is an even easier thing to do when you have magical tricks at your disposal to trade with the local guild, and Malakittal soon found himself a means to get by while he studied. At least until the first time he lost control of a spell he was attempting to to cast, and it cost the life of a valued guild member. strung up and disemboweled, left to die, all should have ended in lonely violence for Malakittal, but such was not to be the case.</p>\n<p>Upon piercing the veil, and casting his gaze upon the first realms of death, as his life left his body, terror tore through the young man’s frame, for there was his arcane master, like a rabid dog, at the end of a chain held by a terrifying Demonic being. With the last breaths of life did Malakittal learn that he had interfered with a demonic pact, and had left his former teacher unable to uphold his end of the deal. Seeing no value yet within Malakittal, the Demon trapped his soul, binding it within a crystal prison, and used his foul magics to force lichdom upon what was left of the young man’s body. Sent back amongst the living, a thing of undeath and fear, Malakittal fled the city, and went even further into hiding. Several hundred years passed between that night in that back city alley, and the night everything would change for ever in the “life” of Malakittal. The night he met Davional.</p>\n<p>Davional was merely looking for a place to wait out the passing of a caravan. Transporting several relics from one temple to another, this caravan had enlisted the aid of a full contingent of Templars and a handful of Paladins, seeking to guarantee the safe arrival of their cargo. It was enough of a threat that Davional, a vampire with several generations of age to his name, felt it better to seek a deeper shelter until they had left his lands, rather than risk discovery and be forced to defend himself. It was this need for a deeper tomb that led the two unlikely friends to first meet, the charismatic vampire, and the antisocial lich. Davional, being ever the opportunist, recognized the power within his grasp, and manipulated the lich expertly, taking full advantage of his lack of social grace or experience, to earn the friendship and loyalty of this powerful being hiding from the world.</p>\n<p>Malakittal has been the shadow behind Davional ever since. When Davional relocated his people (the Wandering Nation) to NaeraCull, it was on the promise to Malakittal that the temperate environment would be good for him, and provide more opportunities to learn new arcane secrets. Establishing themselves within a land ripe with the cultural acceptance of human sacrifice has turned out to be of great amusement to Malakittal, as there is never a shortage of souls wishing to “aid” him in his research.</p>\n</div>","markdown":""},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{"core":{"sheetClass":""}}},{"sort":300000,"name":"The Dralman Documents","type":"text","_id":"Cxr0Se9MxlOrH7Ne","title":{"show":false,"level":1},"image":{},"text":{"format":1,"content":"<div class=\"aventyr\"><p class=\"s5\">The Dralman Documents</p><p></p><p>A skald of some renown, Theo Dralman was quested by the Grand University of @UUID[JournalEntry.QVrlu0lTv2vFtT5P.JournalEntryPage.dwAJ5Jtc6ii8zQoh]{Mohkba} to enter the dark jungle and learn all he could of the spirits to which the native people prayed, and how the @UUID[JournalEntry.QVrlu0lTv2vFtT5P]{Klavek Kingdom} could use this information to its own end. That was many years ago, and many of the legends spoken amongst the tribes that have encountered Dralman would lead one to believe that his goals have changed, and his search for knowledge has become something far more personal. Most of the legends speak of a man carrying a great many scars, as if he had been mauled to the edge of death, only to be spared and shown a new path. There exist a few rare copies of his incomplete work, taken to the coastal towns by couriers and those on safari…the Dralman Documents they have become known as.

What other species claim to be knowledge is called “<strong>Epatarkka</strong>”, meaning inaccurate, imprecise or unclear.</p>\n<p>Obor is also used to mean “the light that shows the way”, whether literally as “torch” or metaphorically as in “wisdom”.</p>\n<p>Obor is also a reclaimed insult, a derogatory, pejorative, politically inflammatory term. It was slang for animal pen (specifically cattle or sheep) in most lands, many years ago. The giants took the term back when they built the wall around Obor and began their isolationist policies</p>\n<h3>Obri</h3>\n<p><strong>Obri</strong> – meaning “Giants” and the title used by any giant talking to any other creature about giants as an entire species. For many species, Obri<strong> </strong>and Obor<strong> </strong>are interchangeable, despite the differences in meaning.</p>\n<h3>Definicni Obor</h3>\n<p><strong>Definicni Obor</strong> – meaning values that define giants. It is a divine position, one taken by a member of the clerical council. Although clan leaders are usually member of the <strong>@UUID[.bUzRK3wWLJPr3eIJ#obrovsky]{Obrovsky}</strong>, they frequently take advice from the members of this group.</p>\n<h3>Maakarioborkauppias</h3>\n<p><strong>Maakarioborkauppias</strong> – meaning “the makers and sellers of giant goods”; all trades belong to this group. It covers all known Crafts, from the most basic wooden utensils to the most complex of locks and traps, and Professions. Within towns and cities, guilds may exist if 10 or more inhabitants are involved in the same activity, but if asked which group they belong to by someone else, a craftsperson or giant of a particular profession will state, “Maakarioborkauppias.”</p>\n<h3>Maatilaoborllinen</h3>\n<p><strong>Maatilaoborllinen</strong> – meaning “owner of the giant lands” and the title used by those who farm or cultivate the agricultural areas of Obor. It is also the name used by members of the druid circle for its society. Rangers occasionally move between this group and the <strong>@UUID[.bUzRK3wWLJPr3eIJ#obrovsky]{Obrovsky}</strong>.</p>\n<h3>Mezioborovy</h3>\n<p><strong>Mezioborovy</strong> – meaning “across all giantkind”. It is an arcane position, one taken by a member of the wizard amalgamation or sorcerer collective. They frequently live slightly isolated lives as their magic can be unpredictable.</p>\n<h3>Obrovsky</h3>\n<p><strong>Obrovsky</strong> – meaning “of the giants”. It is a military position, usually populated by fighters, paladins and barbarians of all types and alignments, which can cause conflict of a deadly nature. It is by far the largest group of giants in Obor. Rangers occasionally move between this group and the <strong>@UUID[.bUzRK3wWLJPr3eIJ#maatilaoborllinen]{Maatilaoborllinen}</strong>.</p>\n<h3>Viceoborovy</h3>\n<p><strong>Viceoborovy</strong> – meaning “for every giant”. A political position usually associated with specific experts, bards and monks. This group can include clan and realm leaders if they wish, although few chose to except on ceremonial occasions.</p>\n<p>It is not known if there are any other societies or social structures used elsewhere by yet-to-be-encountered giant types.</p>\n<p> </p>\n</div>","markdown":""},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{"core":{"sheetClass":"core.JournalTextTinyMCESheet"}}},{"sort":200000,"name":"Language","type":"text","_id":"YvplRrSOlzeMa3MI","title":{"show":false,"level":1},"image":{},"text":{"format":1,"content":"<div class=\"aventyr\"><p class=\"s5\">Language</p><p>Usually called Votun (or very rarely the archaic version, Vutun, which is often seen in the most ancient of giant texts, such as those held by the @UUID[.0ru8kn3zml6fAvTq#frost]{frost giants}) by those who speak it. Originally it only had one form, but each giant-type has developed a dialect of their own as specific regions of Obor grew. It is perhaps the oldest language that exists amongst mortal creatures, with all other languages containing elements of it in either individual word or common phrases. As a language, it can clearly be traced back to Abyssal, Celestial and Infernal roots and is a primordial language.</p><p>Individual @UUID[.YvplRrSOlzeMa3MI#societies]{societal} and @UUID[.YvplRrSOlzeMa3MI#sub-types]{sub-type} dialects and variations are as follows:</p><h2><span id=\"Societies\">Societies</span></h2><h3>Votunobri</h3><p><strong>Votunobri</strong> – the basic language of all giants. Anyone who can speak this can communicate with any creature that is able to speak “Giant”. When most creatures say they can speak “giant”, this is usually the language they mean. However, in terms of complexity, it is a little like a child talking to an adult and giants often chuckle at the lack of sophistication and understanding of what is being said.</p><h3>Votunmenot</h3><p><strong>Votunmenot</strong> – ceremonial language used by all officials, but particularly the <strong>@UUID[.bUzRK3wWLJPr3eIJ#viceoborovy]{Viceoborovy}</strong>. Complex and enormously descriptive at times, it is punctuated by individual words which sum up what may have just taken 20 minutes to describe. It has a great deal in common with the language spoken by treants, which is another language which can be traced back to primordial times.</p><h3>Votunmyymme</h3><p><strong>Votunmyymme</strong> – the trade dialect of the <strong>@UUID[.bUzRK3wWLJPr3eIJ#maakarioborkauppias]{Maakarioborkauppias}</strong>, indicating that the giant itself, or an item made by the giant, is for sale. The dialect consistently suggests “we sell” as a group rather than individualizing any particular activity, reflecting the belief that all crafts and professions rely on each other to be successful.</p><h3>Votunruoka</h3><p><strong>Votunruoka</strong> – the group dialect of the <strong>@UUID[.bUzRK3wWLJPr3eIJ#maatilaoborllinen]{Maatilaoborllinen}</strong>, indicating that the group feeds giantkind, both in terms of providing raw food and cooked meals. It is another basic dialect that leaves little room for misunderstanding or use elsewhere. Giant druids use a form of this dialect.</p><h3>Votunsota</h3><p><strong>Votunsota </strong>–<strong> </strong>language used by the <strong>@UUID[.bUzRK3wWLJPr3eIJ#obrovsky]{Obrovsky}</strong>, full of martial phrases and strident exclamations as well as sections dealing specifically with might, power, arms and armor and battle tactics. It is a relatively straightforward language that can be used without confusion on a battlefield and doesn’t suffer from a possible misunderstanding in meaning when passed along a chain of command. It is at all times a practical and effective dialect.</p><h3>Votuntaika</h3><p><strong>Votuntaika</strong> – language used by the <strong>@UUID[.bUzRK3wWLJPr3eIJ#mezioborovy]{Mezioborovy}</strong>. Full or mysterious and arcane phrasing, it has elements of Draconic entwined within it. There are a number of mythical and legendary words of power within <strong>@UUID[.YvplRrSOlzeMa3MI#votuntaika]{Votuntaika}</strong> which act like metamagic feats when sufficiently understood and practiced, although these seem to only work for giants able to wield arcane power of some significance.</p><h3>Votunuskonto</h3><p><strong>@UUID[.YvplRrSOlzeMa3MI#votunuskonto]{Votunuskonto}</strong> – language used by the <strong>@UUID[.bUzRK3wWLJPr3eIJ#definicni-obor]{Definicni Obor}</strong>. As the language of religion, philosophy and guidance, it has to be clear and exact at all times. All texts and statements which deal with matters of the gods and the ways of giant life are now all recorded in <strong>@UUID[.YvplRrSOlzeMa3MI#votunuskonto]{Votunuskonto}</strong>, as well as the language they were originally received in. This has made the language a powerful tool in dictating the path the giants will take, as it links together the dictates of the gods over time.</p><h2><span id=\"Sub-types\">Sub-types</span></h2><h3><strong>Votunjatti</strong></h3><p><strong>Votunjatti</strong> – spoken by the @UUID[.0ru8kn3zml6fAvTq#athach]{Athach}. Whilst it is recognized by all Obri that athachs are actually aberrations, they are considered the Children of the Gods (see @UUID[.0ru8kn3zml6fAvTq#athach]{athach entry}). <strong>Votunjatti</strong> is even more simplistic than <strong>@UUID[.YvplRrSOlzeMa3MI#votunobri]{Votunobri}</strong>, a straightforward version that athachs have slipped into over the millennia. Some sages moot that it is in fact the gods’ original attempt at a language for a mortal creature (and that athachs are the first attempt at giants), an idea that is closely studied and debated.</p><h3><strong>Votunpilvi</strong></h3><p><strong>Votunpilvi</strong> – spoken by the @UUID[.0ru8kn3zml6fAvTq#cloud]{Cloud giants}. Although these giants have universally deep voices, the tone and flow of their dialect ranges between dark and brooding all the way to high and wispy, just as clouds themselves. Occasionally used by bards for songs and tales of attempts to take hold of the unobtainable.</p><h3><strong>Votuntupla</strong></h3><p><strong>Votuntupla</strong> – spoken by the @UUID[.0ru8kn3zml6fAvTq#ettin]{Ettins}. It is an odd dialect, one that is made up of repetition, double explanation or statement and sometimes cross purpose, particularly when arguments are taking place. It is (correctly) thought that the two heads of an ettin can each only speak part of their overall language capability and that if an ettin was to lose one head yet survive, they would find it very hard to communicate verbally.</p><h3><strong>Votunpalo</strong></h3><p><strong>Votunpalo</strong> – spoken by the @UUID[.0ru8kn3zml6fAvTq#fire]{Fire giants}, the dialect is, naturally, a fiery one, fully of inflammatory delivery and passionate appeals. It is a dialect that lends itself most easily to arguments and energetic activity. Many giants who wish to motivate those around them who make things include a smattering of this dialect.</p><h3><strong>Votunkuura/Votunhuurre</strong></h3><p><strong>Votunkuura/Votunhuurre </strong>– spoken by the @UUID[.0ru8kn3zml6fAvTq#frost]{Frost giants}, <strong>Votunkuura</strong> is a dialect with a significant number of clicking and cracking sounds in addition to actual words. <strong>Vutunhuurre</strong> is a little more delicate and is most frequently used to describe the lands within 100 miles of a frost giant’s home, particularly when discussing details of the natural environment.</p><h3><strong>Votunkunnas</strong></h3><p><strong>Votunkunnas </strong>– spoken by the @UUID[.0ru8kn3zml6fAvTq#hill]{Hill giants}. Like the hills themselves, the dialect is one that rolls, with noticeable peaks and troughs in delivery. It has a range of words to describe fertile land and is sometimes used by those in the druid circle to get complex points across to those knowledgeable about giants.</p><h3><strong>Votunmakeanveden</strong></h3><p><strong>Votunmakeanveden </strong>–<strong> </strong>spoken by the @UUID[.0ru8kn3zml6fAvTq#merrow]{Merrow}. It is a guttural dialect, full of liquid sounds and use of air bubbles in the throat. Not an easy dialect to get to grips with for those who do not speak Aquan.</p><h3><strong>Votunkaaos</strong></h3><p><strong>Votunkaaos </strong>– spoken by the @UUID[.0ru8kn3zml6fAvTq#ogres]{Ogres}. A highly-changeable, ever-adapting dialect that readily picks up words and phrases from other languages and, if spoken for relatively short periods in lands where other humanoids dwell, will morph into a good approximation of that land’s natives’ language.</p><h3><strong>Votunkivi</strong></h3><p><strong>Votunkivi </strong>– spoken by the @UUID[.0ru8kn3zml6fAvTq#stone]{Stone giants}, full of rumbles and grinding notes. Elders use a variation called <strong>Votunjalokivi</strong> when communing with the earth. Although it has close links to Terran, there are no recorded cases of non-stone giant elders being able to speak the dialect.</p><h3><strong>Votunmyrsky</strong></h3><p><strong>Votunmyrsky </strong>– spoken by the @UUID[.0ru8kn3zml6fAvTq#storm]{Storm giants}, it is an all-or-nothing dialect, sounding either at complete calm or alarmingly strident, even when being used, for example, to tell jokes.</p><h3><strong>Votunparantaa</strong></h3><p><strong>Votunparantaa </strong>– spoken by the @UUID[.0ru8kn3zml6fAvTq#trolls]{Trolls}, it is a dialect which can talk endlessly about any topic, given the chance. It folds back in on itself and develops and grows in a seemingly unstoppable way.</p><h3><strong>Votunalamaailma</strong></h3><p><strong>Votunalamaailma </strong>– spoken by the @UUID[.0ru8kn3zml6fAvTq#underworld]{underworld giants}, this dialect is frequently more easily used and understood by Underworld dwellers than other giants when first encountered. If listened to for a week, it becomes clear that it contains much that any other giant does actually understand but is a dark and shadowy version of Votun.</p><p>It is not known if there are any other languages or dialects used elsewhere by yet-to-be-encountered giant types. However, giant language and dialect is so heavily influenced by the land within which users live, particularly in delivery, that if giants do live in swamps, deserts or jungles, then it is more than likely that their dialect will have many components strongly influenced by those natural surroundings, such as the soft, shifting sounds of moving desert sands or dripping, lush noises of a tropical jungle.</p><p> </p></div>","markdown":""},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{"core":{"sheetClass":"core.JournalTextPageSheet"}}},{"sort":300000,"name":"Religion","type":"text","_id":"eSZclzdgw0E9gdK6","title":{"show":false,"level":1},"image":{},"text":{"format":1,"content":"<div class=\"aventyr\"><p class=\"s5\">Religion</p><p>The basis of all giant religion is called Vodoun. It is a traditional animistic religion; Vodoun origin, history and evolution centres around the vodoun spirits and other elements of divine and arcane essences that govern the Obor, a hierarchy that range in power from major deities governing the forces of nature and giant society to the spirits of individual streams, trees, and rocks, as well as dozens of ethnic vodoun spirits, defenders of a certain clan, tribe, or region as well as the nation as a whole.</p><p>The vodoun spirits are the centre of religious life, which is structured around doctrines such as the interaction of spirits (which usually manifest as angels, demons and devils) with living giants. A single adult giant is often a physical equal, if not superior, to an angel, demon or devil, so such interactions aren’t to be feared, more to be learned from.</p><p>Adherents also emphasise ancestor worship and hold that the spirits of the dead live side by side with the world of the living, each family of spirits having its own clearly-stated priesthood, sometimes hereditary, when the clerical or druidic responsibility is passed from parent to appropriate blood child.</p><p>Patterns of worship follow various dialects, gods, practices, songs and rituals. Vodoun recognises two overseeing creator deities with many lesser spirits called @UUID[.eSZclzdgw0E9gdK6#the-apulainen]{Apulainen (Helpers)}. The two creators, one divine and one arcane, called Pappi and Salainen respectively, are androgynous beings who combined to bear thirteen children. These children became the principal Apulainen spirits and Pappi and Salainen gave each rule over a realm of Obor.</p><p>The creators embody a dual principle of light and dark, in which Pappi represents light and the sun whilst Salainen represents darkness and the moon. Each aspect has good and bad points and is considered in positive and negative ways at different times for different reasons.</p><p>Of the thirteen children, twelve are still worshipped today. Each child, all also androgynous beings, now represents one of the twelve remaining giant types that live in Obor. Each giant type is loyal to their patron Apulainen, but gives praise and collection to Pappi and Salainen on appropriate days as well as to the lesser Apulainen of the society, clan and tribe they belong to, and to their own family spirits.</p><p>The thirteenth Apulainen represented the titans, who left Obor to travel the planes many millennia ago. They are no longer considered to be part of giantkind and are rarely referred to. It is considered to be extremely rude to talk of titans with any giant.</p><p>All creation is considered both divine and arcane, and therefore everything contains the power of both of these forces. This is how medicines such as herbal remedies are understood, and explains the casual use of mundane objects in religious ritual. Vodoun talismans, called “fetishes”, are objects such as statues, dried animal parts or manufactured items that are used for their healing and spiritually rejuvenating properties.</p><p>The @UUID[.bUzRK3wWLJPr3eIJ#definicni-obor]{Definicni Obor} and @UUID[.bUzRK3wWLJPr3eIJ#mezioborovy]{Mezioborovy }are entrusted to cast spells on or at enemies on behalf of supplicants, either calling upon vodoun spirits to bring misfortune or harm to a person or group or/and benefit to the supplicant. Sacrifice is a common way to show respect and thankfulness to the gods, usually consisting of something that has taken time, effort and energy to personally produce. Value is of secondary importance to these three factors.</p><p>Pappi and Salainen’s youngest child, @UUID[.eSZclzdgw0E9gdK6#ogres-–-kuopus]{Kuopus}, remains to this day in Obor and acts as a go-between with their other children; it is the principal Apulainen of the @UUID[.0ru8kn3zml6fAvTq#ogres]{ogres} and appears as either a young and virile female when something needs to be done urgently or takes the form of an old man when something needs to be learned and time is available.</p><p>The other chief Apulainen are listed below. After these principal Apulainen, there comes an entire range of lesser and least spirits. The most visible and easily recognised of these is Airut, a messenger spirit who relays messages between the giant world and the world of the Apulainen. It almost always takes the form of a dark, squat giant with a large bag over its shoulder and a pipe in its mouth. As the mediator between the gods and the living Airut maintains balance, order, peace and communication. Airut’s Pipe is able to cast spells and act as a weapon as it can transform into a two-handed hammer as a free action.</p><p>The principal Apulainen of the twelve giant types in Obor are listed below. Each can appear as a male or female as it chooses, or in its natural androgynous form. Each change is usually a free action that doesn’t provoke an attack of opportunity if undertaken in a situation where it is threatened.</p><p>The forms come complete with any clothing, armour and equipment the Apulainen choose to be wearing and carrying at that point. No item worn by an Apulainen remains if it chooses to leave Obor or if it is dismissed or banished. However, it is able to bring specific items to give to giants for a purpose.</p><p></p><h2>The Apulainen</h2><h3>Athach – Ennen</h3><p>Ennen appears as a five-limbed creature that chooses whichever configuration of limbs is most beneficial at that moment in time. It can change up to three limbs as a free action, but changing four or five is a move equivalent action. Although it mostly appears as either a male or female @UUID[.0ru8kn3zml6fAvTq#athach]{athach}, it can also appear as any four-legged beast that resides in Obor but have an arm sprouting from the middle of its back. Alternatively Ennen will walk amongst the athach as a rogue that is particularly dexterous, and attempt to get them to think about solutions to problems that don’t always involve brute strength.</p><h3>Cloud – Ylla</h3><p>Ylla will appear amongst the @UUID[.0ru8kn3zml6fAvTq#cloud]{cloud giants} as a male hunter with huskies or a female bard telling tales of lost souls. In both cases the form is neither particularly striking nor overly plain; it is in its actions that Ylla makes its point. It will also appear as a spectacular display of lenticular clouds over important events, either causing fear in the enemy or providing cover for attackers if required. Ylla will sometimes be found in the company of @UUID[.eSZclzdgw0E9gdK6#storm-–-salama]{Salama}, particularly when the latter is in dragon form, in a cloud form that confounds Salama’s abilities, allow each of them to hone their skills.</p><h3>Ettin – Kaksois</h3><p>Kaksois can appear as a martial-looking male or female @UUID[.0ru8kn3zml6fAvTq#ettin]{ettin} when it wishes to walk amongst its children. It can also appear as twins that are barely distinguishable from their faces but are clearly one male and one female if viewed in their entirety. The ettin forms are experienced and at their prime, whilst the twins are youngsters looking to gain help from the ettins and are a test of their tolerance and wisdom. Kaksois will occasionally appear as a sage, able to see both sides of an issue, and will mediate on a disagreement that hinders progress, whether of an individual ettin or the whole race.</p><h3>Fire – Hotkia</h3><p>Hotkia will appear as a burning fire giant to its followers, either a female cleric or male “paladin”, both of which will look to lead the @UUID[.0ru8kn3zml6fAvTq#fire]{fire giants} it has visited to greater glory. Hotkia will also appear as ceremonial fire at events where such is in place, which is just about every event you can think of that involves fire giants. The flames will be the purest red that any fire giant has seen, with the heat being a cleansing rather than damaging experience.</p><h3>Frost – Valkoinen</h3><p>Valkoinen chooses to appear either as a female ranger out to accompany those who face peril alone or as a monk accompanying travellers and asking them to test themselves as a group, perhaps to complete tasks they never imagined they would face. Valkoinen will also appear as snow fall where every flake is the same or as a layer of frost where every crystal is identical. In either case, it takes a cleric of Valkoinen 2d6 rounds to spot this, a follower [[/roll 2d4]] minutes and anyone with knowledge of giants [[/roll 5d6]] minutes. Once the snow or frost has finished falling ([[/roll 3d2]] hours), it will rise up into Valkoinen’s androgynous form and consider answering requests.</p><h3>Hill – Lehti</h3><p>Lehti appears either as a druid or as a barbarian, male or female. In any of these forms, Lehti is quite young, and always younger than the @UUID[.0ru8kn3zml6fAvTq#hill]{hill giant} it is appearing before. It will often offer to act as a helper for an individual hill giant going about an important or necessary task, slowly showing a more effective or efficient way of completing that task. Only when the task is complete and the hill giant concerned has thanked its new young friend will Lehti reveal itself in its true form, a cross between a hill giant and a treant, although much more like the former.</p><h3>Merrow – Jokijarvi</h3><p>Jokijarvi tends to present an appearance that is overwhelming: as a colossal elder water elemental, engulfing island-size patch of sentient seaweed, or a colossal kraken. It is even said that the great lake serpents are a taken form. At other times, Jokijarvi will walk amongst the @UUID[.0ru8kn3zml6fAvTq#merrow]{merrow} as a cleric, or very occasionally sorcerer. The merrow aren’t known for their spell casting ability, and every now and then Jokijarvi will conduct an “enlightenment drive” to ensure knowledge is spread by more merrow than shamen and tribal elders. These drives involve finding up to a dozen young merrow and providing the “Mark of All Merrow,” a birthmark that actually taps into innate spell casting ability and brings it forth.</p><h3>Ogres – Kuopus</h3><p>Kuopus is generally happy to let the image of @UUID[.0ru8kn3zml6fAvTq#ogres]{ogres} as crude boors ride, because it means they have to learn to stand on their own two feet and be rewarded by a distinct place in the world. Taking the typical barbarian form of the ogres, Kuopus encourages robust tournaments designed to let the cream of the ogres rise to the top, even as the god appears as an old man. But at other times, Kuopus walks amongst the ogres as the most charming and eloquent of their type, encouraging a self-expression that is usually held in almost brutal check. Often female, but not exclusively, Kuopus appears as a bard or story-telling illusionist, and revels that the ogres throw themselves whole-heartedly into can last for weeks. These revels encourage the often down-trodden ogres to face a world that despises them with renewed vigour. Kuopus is also the go-between for the other gods.</p><h3>Stone – Paasi</h3><p>The @UUID[.0ru8kn3zml6fAvTq#stone]{stone giant} people rarely see Passi, but they know their god is amongst them at all times. Passi IS stone, and has adopted the stone giants because of their affinity with the material, and is present as the mountains and lands the giants live on, work with, and use as tools, homes and weapons. If Passi does appear in a clearly recognisable form, it is as a travelling elder at a moot, or as an expert in some problem, stepping in to advise and guide, but never tell, a stone giant council or individual how to move on from an issue OR not make a mistake through a particular curse of action. Occasionally Passi will take the form of an ideal earth elemental from the dreams of stone giant children, although this is really just a slight variation in Passi’s usual form of stone itself.</p><h3>Storm – Salama</h3><p>Salama is a slightly contrary god, usually appearing as the opposite of the @UUID[.0ru8kn3zml6fAvTq#storm]{storm giant} who receives a visit. A heavily-armed fighter will see Salama as a robed monk, a wandering ranger sees a desk-bound mage or sage, an aristocrat sees a commoner, males see a female, and so on. Salama enjoys changing perception as much as the weather, and will present a form that encourages introspection and then release of hidden talents and unexpected innate abilities. If angry, Salama appears as a force dragon of a size sufficient to frighten whoever is the annoyance into an apology; all storm giant tales relate that Salama has never killed anyone or anything in this form, preferring to humiliate them and leave them bereft of all belongings and dignity. However, those tales also say that if Salama does kill someone when in dragon form, it will herald the end of the world. Salama is sometimes found with Ylla, who provides a worthy sparring partner for Salama’s force dragon form.</p><h3>Trolls – Oliivi</h3><p>Oliivi was once a simple @UUID[.0ru8kn3zml6fAvTq#trolls]{troll}, just like those walk Obor to this day. The difference between Oliivi and the trolls that came before is that the now-god found a way to channel the chaos and evil that trolls live by into unifying forces. Oliivi is actually responsible for introducing the isolationist views that all giants now hold, encouraging trolls to use their chaotic ways to promote troll clans over all others, and their evil approach to ensure troll elite were able to come out on top in any situation. Today, Oliivi will appear amongst the trolls as a ranger or druid of either sex, often when a tribe has fallen to ways that are too chaotic or too evil; after appearing out of seemingly nowhere, Oliivi will once again show that the way for trolls to succeed is to channel their natural instincts outwards onto others, not onto each other. This is a never-ending task</p><h3>Underworld – Maan–Uumenissa</h3><p>Little is known about Maan-Uumenissa, even by the @UUID[.0ru8kn3zml6fAvTq#underworld]{underworld giants} themselves. Stories say that the god bears the weight of the entire world at all times, and that providing places for the underworld giants to live and thrive is enough to give thanks for. Maan-Uumenissa is actually currently in torpor; when the world was struck by the “Shard of the Sun”, the carnage it caused (such as the Scarred Lands) struck the god deeply, and now Maan-Uumenissa rests to heal wounds that have damaged an entire planet. The god does visit the underworld giants on very rare occasions, usually as the ghost a mage who concentrates on spells associated with stone and force, or as the spirit of an expert stone mason able to carve a place to live from the solid mass of the Underworld. It is rumoured some @UUID[JournalEntry.QlctNkzE9injOde9.JournalEntryPage.t4LZuyNruvzneOHD]{deep dwarves} also worship Maan–Uumenissa, tapping into the god’s ability to work with stone to create particularly spiritual places far below the surface of Obor. If an alliance of these dwarves and giants ever occurs, other races will almost certainly find themselves out of a home.</p><p></p></div>","markdown":""},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}},{"sort":400000,"name":"Race History","type":"text","_id":"0ru8kn3zml6fAvTq","title":{"show":false,"level":1},"image":{},"text":{"format":1,"content":"<div class=\"aventyr\"><p class=\"s5\">Race History</p><h2>Athach</h2><p>Athach – The athach people came about as a result of <em>Pappi</em> and <em>Salainen</em> gathering together all the children of the other giant races that didn’t quite match the ideal they had in mind for them. They saw the advantage of a race that confounded belief, both within Obor and without, and ensured the newly-named athach race survived and, in its own way, flourished, with <em>@UUID[.eSZclzdgw0E9gdK6#athach-–-ennen]{Ennen}</em> charged to watch over it. To this day, the athach view themselves as special and chosen, but this knowledge is often enough to drive them to the brink of madness.</p><p><strong>Leader: </strong>Kolme Kadet - 5th level bard, 5th level fighter (Cha 13)</p><h2>Cloud</h2><p>Cloud – The cloud giants came into being from the very air, as <em>@UUID[.eSZclzdgw0E9gdK6#cloud-–-ylla]{Ylla}</em>, drew air, earth, fire and water together and moulded them into the clouds. To this day, cloud giants are able to show how each of the four elements are part of their “whole”, and explain why this sum is greater than the individual elemental parts. At their death, the most venerated cloud giants are afforded a ceremony which ensures their bodies are returned to the four elements in equal parts, so they can influence the very being of future members of the race.</p><p><strong>Leader: </strong>Tupruta Kevyt 12th level cleric</p><h2>Ettin</h2><p>Ettin – Ettin tales relate that when they were created, their maker <em>@UUID[.eSZclzdgw0E9gdK6#ettin-–-kaksois]{Kaksois }</em>had so much for them to say and do that two heads were necessary in order to achieve all that was required of them. Unfortunately, <em>Kaksois</em> failed to give any indication which head was in charge and so discord is as frequent a visitor as harmony. It is also said that if the two heads of a single ettin ever achieve complete agreement on every matter for the duration of a full moon, ettins everywhere will rise to lead the Obri nation in a wise and benevolent way.</p><p><strong>Leader: </strong>Kaksikko Paa 13th level fighter</p><h2>Fire</h2><p>Fire – Fire giants originally consisted of outcasts from all other societies, hotheads and rabble-rousers who drove others to despair before finding themselves permanently banished in order to save everyone else’s sanity. Many retreated from the land that was known, taking to the depths and lost places away from the hills and mountains that giants were used to living in. <em>@UUID[.eSZclzdgw0E9gdK6#fire-–-hotkia]{Hotkia}</em> is talked of as if the god actually walked amongst the earliest outcasts, leading them to the fiery rifts and heights that others ignored. These travels took the nomads to <em>Aitotulivuori</em>, the largest, most internally-active volcano in Obor. From here the fire giant tribes and clans grew, descending deep into the earth at the same time. Eventually a rift to the Elemental Plane of Fire was discovered, and the identity of the fire giants properly established.</p><p><strong>Leader: </strong>Palo Halko 6th level expert, 6th level warrior</p><h2>Frost</h2><p>Frost – The frost giants hold that they were the first giants, when <em>Pappi</em> and <em>Salainen</em> took it upon themselves to count the flakes of snow that fell on the ring of mountains far to the north of what is now Obor. As they landed, each became a giant; the first of these were the frost giants, who took their place at the top of the mountains. Others that followed became the other races and moved elsewhere to live their live, making the frost giants the pre-eminent members of their species. At least that is what the frost giants say, and who’s to doubt them. Their artefacts are clearly older than those of any other race, whilst <em>@UUID[.YvplRrSOlzeMa3MI#votunkuura/votunhuurre]{vutunhuurre }</em>has no direct link with any other Obri language, other than <em>@UUID[.YvplRrSOlzeMa3MI#votunkuura/votunhuurre]{votunkuura}</em>. Elderly frost giants are also known to occasionally hibernate, something no other giant-type does.</p><p><strong>Leader: </strong>Routainen Tanner 10th level sorcerer (Cha 18)</p><p></p><h2>Hill</h2><p>Hill – Hill giants took their place amongst the other races when no other giant wanted to live on the “lowlands”. Instead, those who found themselves at the bottom of their own hierarchy move away and banded together on the low peaks and wooded slopes of the Obor hills, becoming their own people. Although this life was difficult, without any of the massive majesty other giant environs offer, <em>@UUID[.eSZclzdgw0E9gdK6#hill-–-lehti]{Lehti }</em>show this new clan how to make the most of their new life and home, things which the hills giants still guard with jealousy, even as many secretly wish they could trace their heritage and return to an original home.</p><p><strong>Leader: </strong>Alava Kumpu 12th level paladin (Wis 14, Cha 12)</p><h2>Merrow</h2><p>Merrow – Although only the most senior clerics or deep-in-trance sorcerers of their will admit it, the original merrow were giants driven from the Obor lands for acting in the worst interests of all Obri. The exact nature of their actions is unclear, but the guidelines of the <em>@UUID[.bUzRK3wWLJPr3eIJ#definicni-obor]{Definicni Obor }</em>make a number of statements that refer to the “outcasts beyond our shores”. To the uninitiated, this seems to simply mean non-giants; internally, it refers to the merrow. <em>@UUID[.eSZclzdgw0E9gdK6#merrow-–-jokijarvi]{Jokijarvi }</em>took up their cause at the request of <em>Pappi</em> and <em>Salainen</em>, who ultimately want all giants to live together, yet know that those who don’t think of the Obri first and foremost need to pay a price. This price is being cursed to ultimately have to live in water, with only short periods on dry land.</p><p>Saltwater merrow are thought to exist, but are very rare if they do.</p><p><strong>Leader: </strong>Vesi Pesa 14th level druid</p><p></p><h2>Ogres</h2><p>Ogres – <em>@UUID[.eSZclzdgw0E9gdK6#ogres-–-kuopus]{Kuopus’s}</em> ogres have always been viewed by other giants as the children of <em>Pappi</em> and <em>Salainen</em>; they are usually loud, vulgar, and act in an out-of-control manner should they pick up barbarian tendencies. But they have also always been the link between the Obri and the outside world. The elves first realised this and gave the giants a number of islands of their eastern coast, where a part-elf-part ogre race developed and flourished, in order for the Obri to present skilled diplomats to the rest of the inhabitants of the planet. To this day, the agreed representative of all the giants is a member of this race, and has been for as long as giants can remember. As the go-between between his parents and the other <em>apulainen,</em> <em>Kuopus </em>knows what it is like to be an emissary,<em> </em>and ensures the chosen <em>elgres</em> do the very best job they can at all times.</p><p><strong>Leader: </strong>Rumilus Hirmu 13th level barbarian</p><h2>Stone</h2><p>Stone – As <em>Pappi</em> and <em>Salainen</em> created the frost giants, <em>@UUID[.eSZclzdgw0E9gdK6#stone-–-paasi]{Passi }</em>sat on a rock and watched. Eventually the ground froze, and then cracked, as the cold seeped into it. From the shards of rock that were created when these cracks occurred, the first stone giants were formed. They were charged with protecting the ground that made up Obor from the frost giants, offering other giant types a chance to find a place to call home. As caretakers of the land, stone giants take their duties very seriously, and will engage with another creature only until it promises to stop harming the land. Then will turn from foe to friend in a moment, help heal the individuals concerned, and send them on their way.</p><p>The stone giants also built the wall that surrounds Obor; along with gnome engineers, the wall was created within a month, with time to spare to have giants everywhere test it by hurling rocks at it. To this day, it has survived any and all assaults.</p><p><strong>Leader: </strong>Jalo Marmori 11th level rogue (Dex 17)</p><h2>Storm</h2><p>Storm – The contrary nature of <em>@UUID[.eSZclzdgw0E9gdK6#storm-–-salama]{Salama}</em> is what drove storm giants to leave the land and take to the air. However, <em>Salama</em> couldn’t quite leave the land behind, and granted storm giants to ability to raise up huge flying citadels that float as might the lightest feather. To this day, tales of aggrieved storm giants uprooting villages and small towns to either save them or punish them occur in equal measure. Storm giants are also called on when drought has occurred as they can, for the right price, ensure enough rain falls to satisfy even the most water-starved area.</p><p>Storm giants have also traditionally overseen the flying fortress that holds a sliver of the “Shard of the Sun” in a highly-protected sphere that is used to power a particularly effective weather machine. This particular task has fallen to one family for many years now, as is a task that is undertaken with complete seriousness.</p><p><strong>Leader: </strong>Alykas Kipina 14th level wizard (Int 17)</p><h2>Trolls</h2><p>Trolls – Any troll will tell you that they spontaneously stepped from the ground the moment <em>@UUID[.eSZclzdgw0E9gdK6#trolls-–-oliivi]{Oliivi} </em>decided that it should be so, and that they will never leave the land until <em>Pappi</em> and <em>Salainen</em> ask them to go. This means not only the troll species as a whole, but also the individuals that make up its number, particularly those that are able to spur the troll nation to bigger and better rewards. Within the giant lands, trolls tend to keep to themselves, fitting in with all the other giant types almost unnoticed. However, when decisions are to be made, senior trolls appear seemingly out of thin air to voice their strongly isolationist views. The other side of this is that they make better-suited individuals for certain professions, and can be trusted to the very end once a deal has been struck (unless another troll is involved).</p><p><strong>Leader: </strong>Kasvaa Paluu 7th Level ranger, 6th level druid</p><h2>Underworld</h2><p>Underworld – As with <em>@UUID[.eSZclzdgw0E9gdK6#underworld-–-maan–uumenissa]{Maan–Uumenissa}</em>, little is known about the history of the underworld giants, more because it is shrouded in mystery rather than individuals not knowing. Nothing is clear about why the original members retreated to the depths, or how they managed to establish themselves once they were there. In fact, the first few giants to retreat into the Underworld were a band who could not decide which of the other <em>apulainen</em> to follow, so left the surface of Obor to follow another path. <em>Maan-Uumenissa</em> found them wandering in despair, and vowed to support them forever onwards, even though the weight of the world was on the god’s shoulders. Since then, Underworld giants have slowly adapted to their home, and are now experts at getting the most from the cold, hard rock around them.</p><p><strong>Leader: </strong>Alempi Kamara 9th level monk (Dex 14, Wis 14)</p></div>","markdown":""},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{"core":{"sheetClass":"core.JournalTextPageSheet"}}},{"sort":500000,"name":"Regions","type":"text","_id":"DGCq9pB33FlnM4rY","title":{"show":false,"level":1},"image":{},"text":{"format":1,"content":"<div class=\"aventyr\"><p class=\"s5\">Regions</p><h2>Ydin-koto</h2><p>The north coast that runs along the side of the @UUID[JournalEntry.QVrlu0lTv2vFtT5P]{Klavek Kingdom} is known as Ydin-koto (Original Home). It is a narrow range of massively tall mountains, some of which are built into the wall surrounding Obor. It is the home of the @UUID[.0ru8kn3zml6fAvTq#frost]{frost giants}, along with many @UUID[.0ru8kn3zml6fAvTq#cloud]{cloud giants} and some storm giants. Links to the Elemental Planes of Air and Earth can be found here, although none are permanent. A continuous storm, roughly 10 miles across, follows a circular path that is about 1,500 miles in circumference, travelling at between 15 and 20 miles a day. Much of this storm is out at sea, but it works its way along the coast for about six or seven days of every 86 day cycle</p><h2>Aitotulivuori</h2><p>The home of the @UUID[.0ru8kn3zml6fAvTq#fire]{fire giants} is Aitotulivuori, which is about three miles high and surrounded by the taller, frozen mountains. It is also situated to the north of Obor, and is considered part of @UUID[.DGCq9pB33FlnM4rY#ydin-koto]{Ydin-koto} by non-giants. There are a number of deep rifts around the base of the volcano, at least two of which descend around nine miles underground. At this depth, a permanent link to the Elemental Plane of Fire can be found, although very few creatures, including the fire giants themselves, ever make it there. Any that are encountered are usually extraplanar visitors, with many coming to or going from a summoning, having completed their part of a bargain or spell; almost all are seen leaving with payments of some kind, sometimes in kind.</p><h2>Ylä–mäki</h2><p>Ylä–mäki which sits in the bay at the top of mainland Obor, is the greatest peak in the country, standing at roughly 13 miles high. Deep within it are the entranceways to the Underworld and giants that make their home there. At its summit, a @UUID[.0ru8kn3zml6fAvTq#frost]{frost giant} observatory sits, watching the skies for the celestial conjunction that will signal ”The Beginning of the End”. This is either a time when all people will come together to live harmoniously, or is the first in a series of cataclysmic events that will trigger the implosion of Obor and its neighbouring lands. Unfortunately, the frost giants aren’t certain which it is that is going to happen. Outside of Obor, it is known as ”High Tor”.</p><h2>Keha and Kaari</h2><p>Off the northern shore are Keha and Kaari (the Ring and the Arc). These islands were formed when debris from the falling ”Shard of the Sun” landed and caused the seabed to rise up above the level of the surface in some places. The islands are often used by @UUID[.0ru8kn3zml6fAvTq#merrow]{merrow} as resting places if, for example, storms become too rough, or they are meeting non-giants for, for example, trading purposes. The islands are riddled with caves and narrow inlets, making currents around them treacherous. Giant pirates operate from here. The islands are also rather gem-rich, as the heat from their creation caused much of the raised seabed to turn to gems, but getting them is difficult.</p><h2>Taivas Tasanko</h2><p>There is a huge mesa plateau, Taivas Tasanko, on a disputed bulge of land that is almost surrounded by Klavek, roughly in the middle of that country’s southern border. The mesa is over three miles high and just about 400 miles in circumference, taking up the whole of the ”bulge”. The wall enclosing Obor is even built around the base of the mesa, to ensure continuity. This is where Pappi and Salainen first stepped on the planet, and is still the first stepping stone for all the apulainen when they visit. On the top of the plateau is a martial monastery and place of worship, Luostari. Every giant race is represented here, although it is not an “equal” place; for example, currently the @UUID[.0ru8kn3zml6fAvTq#athach]{athachs} are camped on the roof, whilst the @UUID[.0ru8kn3zml6fAvTq#merrow]{merrow} have to change their representatives every few days due to the lack of water.</p><h2>Raja Linnoitus</h2><p>The entire southern sea border of Obor is one huge military and governmental administrative building called Raja Linnoitus. This building, built entire for giant-sized occupants, is where anyone visiting Obor is officially allowed to enter. Anyone found in the country without the required paperwork issued from this place has just one chance to be taken into custodial care or will be executed on the spot. The giants are very particular about this. Only two groups – all @UUID[JournalEntry.QlctNkzE9injOde9.JournalEntryPage.lMtTJxWecu1ISdP0]{gnomes} from @UUID[JournalEntry.2cK9lISUylZwk24i]{Pradjna}, and @UUID[JournalEntry.QlctNkzE9injOde9.JournalEntryPage.ei36LjIhEoh87vgE]{elves} who are residents of the Elgres islands – are exempt.</p><h2>The southern border</h2><p>The southern border with the Scorched Lands, and western borders with the unclaimed territories and Pradjna, all have a series of airboat platforms every 50 miles along the protective wall. These towers are roughly half a mile high, with the only landing platform at the top and just one exit at the base. When the Pradjna gnomes helped the giants build the defensive wall around the whole country, the giants gave the gnomes the details of how to make the flying citadels that storm giants use. The gnomes developed airboats for both themselves and the giants, and requested that safe stations be placed on the joint border. These airboats are prized items, in particular those built for giants, and are defended at all costs. Any non-giant or non-gnome in possession of one will find that they receive constant requests to sell it, often for overly-large sums. Neither the giants nor the gnomes like them falling into the hands of other races.</p><h2>Kadotettu</h2><p>Off the coast of the Vast Swamp, towards its northern border with the Scorched Lands, Obor has ownership of an island, Kadotettu, which is the place where the titans left for other realms. It is unclear whether the loss of the titans from the giant population is considered a good or bad state of affairs; the titans were insisting on being allowed a stronger influence over the entire giant population just before their departure, a situation that was causing internal rifts throughout the rest of the @UUID[.bUzRK3wWLJPr3eIJ#obri]{Obri}. Eventually the titans’ request was refused and they left, which brought about a return to internal stability and a golden age when the rest of giantkind took significant strides forward. Kadotettu is now inhabited by a force of @UUID[.0ru8kn3zml6fAvTq#trolls]{trolls}, land-based and aquatic, that protects the ancient titan departure site from treasure hunters and glory-seekers. These trolls are all extremely experienced druids, rangers and sorcerers, for whom the service of guarding the island is one of great honour.</p><h2>Jattaltia</h2><p>At the southern end of the @UUID[JournalEntry.wVQiwLZtRuaqbpFA]{Silent Forest}, in a bay close to @UUID[JournalEntry.oVgfVPmxlNXfN3CW]{Timaeus} and a little further out to sea, Obor has sovereignty of a group of six islands called the Jattaltia. It is here that the ogre-elf clans, the Elgres in Common tongue, live; careful selective matchmaking continues to produce exemplary children who are trained to become the outward-facing elite of Obor. Korkein Esimerkki, 20th-Level Expert, is currently the main contact any of the other races have with Obor (except the gnomes of Pradjna) and he is a member of a prominent Jattaltia family that can trace its mixed lineage back for over 350 generations. These islands are almost identical in nature to the Silent Forest, yet most structures are giant-sized. They also each have an airboat docking tower.</p></div>","markdown":""},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{"core":{"sheetClass":"core.JournalTextPageSheet"}}}],"flags":{"cf":{"id":null},"core":{"sourceId":"Compendium.Aventyr-Campaign-Setting.aventyr-campaign.CZklpkirPVkYlgVp"},"scene-packer":{"hash":"fdd58e3603cfda298b3fd31731d921c0b1350b56"}},"_stats":{"systemId":"dnd5e","systemVersion":"2.1.4","coreVersion":"10.291","createdTime":1664018841723,"modifiedTime":1674975191536,"lastModifiedBy":"EsIYTtNnjwxUbKOG"},"_id":"CZklpkirPVkYlgVp","ownership":{"default":0,"R5IsvMTH5P79pBoG":3},"folder":"j9cXBagzZ1ARsO2I","sort":200000},{"name":"Picollo","pages":[{"sort":200000,"name":"Picollo","type":"text","_id":"Fo8ZyJ0HbBDVVALU","title":{"show":false,"level":1},"image":{},"text":{"format":1,"content":"<div class=\"aventyr\">\n<p class=\"s5\">Picollo</p>\n<img style=\"display:block;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto\" src=\"modules/aaw-games-aventyr/Setting-images/Picollo-map-750x277.webp\" width=\"496\" height=\"246\" /></div>\n<div class=\"aventyr\"> </div>\n<div class=\"aventyr\"><img style=\"float:right;margin:0px 15px 15px 0px;border:0px\" src=\"modules/aaw-games-aventyr/Setting-images/halfling-bosun-copy.webp\" width=\"204\" height=\"287\" />\n<p>Two hundred miles off the southern tip of @UUID[JournalEntry.oVgfVPmxlNXfN3CW]{Timaeus} lay the island nation of Picollo. Once an archipelago stretching deep into the southern ocean, much of its ancient lands were destroyed in the Great Schism, crushed by the falling body of the Dracoprime. Only the big island and a few scattered isles survived the cataclysm some 500 years ago, and since the disaster, the peoples and culture of @UUID[JournalEntry.QlctNkzE9injOde9.JournalEntryPage.myrc4omqUaiD3RKZ]{Halfling} society have struggled for their very survival, some might say for their very souls.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Ancient Picollo was first and foremost a peaceful realm of farmers, drinkers, and enjoyers of all the good stuff that life has to offer. Halflings were simple and open people, finding beauty in all the blessings that the gods placed upon their island homes. @UUID[.Gv1vyttllOYQaK2t#mainland-picollo-–-the-big-island]{Mainland Picollo – The Big Island} was covered in green rolling farmlands, save for the @UUID[.Gv1vyttllOYQaK2t#the-great-mountain]{The Great Mountain} in the north, and @UUID[.Gv1vyttllOYQaK2t#the-great-forest]{The Great Forest}to the west. The isles of the archipelago provided a diversity of agricultural products and stimulated halfling naval architecture and maritime trade; in its heyday, the merchant fleets of Picollo traded with most of Aventyr, and trading enclaves from other nations were common on the big island. Many of these grew into larger towns and cities, in contrast to halfling settlements, which remained centered on village life.</p>\n<p>The destruction of the Great Schism changed the face of Picollo forever. The two hundred years following the cataclysm were consumed by efforts to survive and rebuild, but just as the land and people started to recover, @UUID[JournalEntry.QlctNkzE9injOde9.JournalEntryPage.SGw7zGFtvjLNPDMY]{Hoyrall} burst onto the scene. For two centuries the aliens tunnelled inside the great mountain, and then to other parts of Aventyr through the caverns and tunnels of the Underworld that intersected with the new construction. Hives that remained behind launched a full scale invasion of the halfling lands—the invading force wiped out halfling villages everywhere they went, colonizing the land and setting up new hives like mindless drones. The only diplomacy they engaged in was to strip away the alliances of the human settlements in Picollo; the twicelings thought themselves safe but when the ties were cut, the hoyrall broke their agreements and turned, destroying them utterly.</p>\n<p>The remaining halflings took to the forest and isolated slopes of the great mountain. Stealth, trickery, and valiant assaults kept the sorely pressed halflings from being completely overrun, but it was the Confluence and breaking of the hoyrall hive-mind that allowed them to make headway against the invaders. The halflings joined forces with the fey of the great forest and the @UUID[JournalEntry.QlctNkzE9injOde9.JournalEntryPage.t4LZuyNruvzneOHD]{Dwarf} of @UUID[.Gv1vyttllOYQaK2t#stoneroot]{Stoneroot}, wiping their land clean of the insectoid invaders.</p>\n<p>Recovery has been slow; @UUID[JournalEntry.QlctNkzE9injOde9.JournalEntryPage.myrc4omqUaiD3RKZ]{Halfling} tribes returned to their homes to find everything their ancestors had built completely destroyed. They had to start from scratch and build anew. Though once drawn together by a common enemy, despair and exhaustion has taken its toll. In ancient times, nearby villages often joined together to accomplish greater projects than they could alone: now, the rebuilding of Picollo is insular and clannish. Desperate for labor but wary of other humanoids, indentured servitude has been introduced across the island for would-be immigrants. Travelers to these lands find scant welcome and are carefully watched, spied upon by night. Most visitors rarely travel further than the coastal ports due to the @UUID[.PmrSWZmvMcJz6g4H#xenophobia]{Xenophobia} in Picollan villages. Any non-halfling in the interior is assumed to be an @UUID[.PmrSWZmvMcJz6g4H#indentured-servitude]{Indentured Servitude}, or perhaps a freedman who has completed his term of service.</p>\n<p>Modern halflings pay lip service to the merry and celebratory traditions of ancient times, and the end of the wars means that the traditional festivals are once again being celebrated, but there is a darker shadow now to their people, an untrustworthy part.

Any elder visiting The Nines is free to participate in the ongoing debates and discussions; the Eldermoot serves more as a cultural communications hub rather than a legislative assembly. Its decrees and proclamations have only the force of recommendations to the villages throughout Picollo with the single exception of matters relating to indentured servitude and freedman colonies—both of which are strictly regulated throughout Picollo.</span></span></p><p style=\"box-sizing:border-box;user-select:text;margin:0.5em 0px;min-height:1rem\"><span style=\"font-family:Signika, sans-serif\"><span style=\"font-family:Signika, sans-serif\">The First Speaker, along with an advisory board of four Second Speakers, runs the meetings throughout the year and manages a professional team of scribes and servants that record the events in assembly. The First Speaker is elected every spring from amongst the elders present during the Festival of Renewal and receives a stipend to cover all costs of the administration (as well as his own personal living expenses) from funds collected at the close of each debate—some unpopular Speakers are reduced to penury when the donations dry up. Bribery within the Eldermoot is almost unheard of as most of the edicts of the Eldermoot have little force in law.</span></span></p><h3><span style=\"font-family:Signika, sans-serif\"><span style=\"font-family:Signika, sans-serif\">Board of Indentures and the Council of Freedmen</span></span></h3><p><span style=\"font-family:Signika, sans-serif\"><span style=\"font-family:Signika, sans-serif\">Since the introduction of @UUID[.PmrSWZmvMcJz6g4H#indentured-servitude]{indentured} servitude in Picollo some six cycles of servants have served their terms and achieved freedman status—many thousands more are serving out their indentureship. Responsible for the legislation and regulation of both indentured servitude and freedman rights, ten halfling elders sit on the Board of Indentures. The original ten elders were elected by the @UUID[.X0uyBqIKLevC15mx#the-eldermoot]{Eldermoot;} currently election to the board is the prerogative of the Council of Freedmen. The appointment is for life and the council has had the opportunity to elect only four replacements in the last fifty years. With these younger fellows, the six original members enjoy their venerable years dominating the most politically influential group in Picollo.</span></span></p><p><span style=\"font-family:Signika, sans-serif\"><span style=\"font-family:Signika, sans-serif\">The Council of Freedmen consists of seven freedmen serving the interests of both freedmen and indentures throughout Picollo. Its representatives are chosen not by the freedmen themselves, but by the Eldermoot at the same time as the speakers. A councillor serves a single term of seven years, and the terms are staggered so that a new councillor replaces a retiring one every year. The most powerful influence the council retains is the election of a member to the Board of Indentures, but as this opportunity comes rarely, one could argue how much influence actually resides within the prerogative.</span></span></p><p><span style=\"font-family:Signika, sans-serif\"><span style=\"font-family:Signika, sans-serif\">The council sits in the Eldermoot seven days out of every ten, but is granted the right to speak only on the first and last day of each cycle (the Right of Voice). The council usually meets in private during the three-day banishment, when the Eldermoot (advised by the Board of Indentures) is free to discuss freedman issues without prying ears.</span></span></p><p><span style=\"font-family:Signika, sans-serif\"><span style=\"font-family:Signika, sans-serif\">Legislation regarding freedman and indentured rights may only be proposed by members of the Board of Indentures, although freedman councillors can speak to the issue when they have the Right of Voice. Freedmen councillors also vote on proposed legislation. Passing, amending, or abolishing a law requires a majority vote on both the Board and the Council.</span></span></p><p><span style=\"font-family:Signika, sans-serif\"><span style=\"font-family:Signika, sans-serif\">Unlike election to the Eldermoot, bribery is commonplace in the Council of Freedmen and within the Board of Indentures. Members of both bodies are courted by conservative and progressive villages in regards to indentured rights, and having a tame freedman councillor or a friendly ear on the Board can be useful.</span></span></p><h3><span style=\"font-family:Signika, sans-serif\"><span style=\"font-family:Signika, sans-serif\">Guilds and Secret Societies</span></span></h3><p><span style=\"font-family:Signika, sans-serif\"><span style=\"font-family:Signika, sans-serif\">Though not part of formal government, Picollo is rife with guilds, collectives, and secret societies.

Gone are the days of bucolic, carefree attitudes and the joy of discovery. The traditional (and often religious) ties of family and community are threatened by an increasing reliance on deal making and practicality. Some families and villages long to return to the ancient traditions, but modern halflings have scant experience with them, save tales of days long past. Most halflings attempt to live a life of tradition as evidenced in these tales, but the agrarian, village-centric life only masks a deeper and more cynical pragmatism.</p>\n<h2>Xenophobia</h2>\n<p>Due to their enslavement during the Hoyrall Wars and betrayal by humanoid settlements in their lands, halflings have become very protective of each other. This protection manifests in different ways; at a very young age all halflings are taught to help one another regardless of their moral standing or ulterior motives. As they grow to maturity, however, halflings begin to realize that they have survived in part due to a darker heritage, one of suspicion and mistrust. This heritage is the one that forges secret pacts, thieves guilds, and dark deals to protect the halfling way of life and prevent outsiders from again betraying or invading their lands. Even with this dark shadow, it is taboo for one halfling to kill another even under dire circumstances—those that do face banishment.</p>\n<p>Halflings of mainland Picollo (and the Isles) do regard the @UUID[JournalEntry.QlctNkzE9injOde9.JournalEntryPage.RTYoyteEKY7EOhy2]{Dweorg}of Stonehelm as worthy allies, as well as the fey of the @UUID[.Gv1vyttllOYQaK2t#the-great-forest]{Great Forest}.

In desperate need of labor to rebuild, halfling merchants often collect the downtrodden and out-of-luck across Aventyr to ship home and bind to a seven-year term of service. Not only does this provide additional labor and hard coin for the merchant captains who ply the seas, some halflings believe a term of service will teach those of other races the value of loyalty.</p>\n<h2>Religion</h2>\n<img style=\"float:right;margin:0px 15px 15px 0px;border:0px\" src=\"modules/aaw-games-aventyr/Setting-images/Great-Mother.webp\" width=\"195\" height=\"280\" />\n<p>Worship of @UUID[JournalEntry.dOJJ8mRNTPtoihmF.JournalEntryPage.7JZLaCukpLMqn2R2]{The Mother Spirit} still pervades halfling culture and has spread to other lands by way of the many exiles residing across Aventyr. Villages are centered around the Holy Tree of of the central green where communal worship is held. The pressures and loss of the Hoyrall Wars have undermined the tenets of community espoused by the Great Mother however, and a village religious leader is as often as not to be a “@UUID[JournalEntry.dOJJ8mRNTPtoihmF.JournalEntryPage.7JZLaCukpLMqn2R2#fallen-leaf-cleric]{Fallen Leaf cleric}”, not through any evil or heretical design, but simply through an erosion of the ancient understandings.

The big island is 400 miles wide at its widest point. At the northern end of the island, the weather is temperate and the Great Mountain rises seven miles to its peak. The western side of the island sports the Great Forest, while the eastern side is made up of rolling farmlands in the interior and deepwater ports on the coast. The fractured southern tip of the island still bears the scars of the Great Schism, and overland travel is difficult in the sub-tropical climate of the south due to the number of fresh and brackish waterways permeating the broken landscape.</p><h3>The Nines</h3><p>LN large town</p><p><strong>Corruption:</strong> +0; <strong>Crime:</strong> +0; <strong>Economy:</strong> +2; <strong>Law:</strong> +1; <strong>Lore:</strong> +0; <strong>Society:</strong> +3</p><p><strong>Qualities:</strong> rumormongering citizens, strategic location, tourist attraction</p><p><strong>Danger:</strong> +5</p><p>DEMOGRAPHICS</p><p><strong>Government:</strong> council</p><p><strong>Population:</strong> 4,750 (3,500 @UUID[JournalEntry.QlctNkzE9injOde9.JournalEntryPage.myrc4omqUaiD3RKZ]{Halfling}; 30 @UUID[JournalEntry.QlctNkzE9injOde9.JournalEntryPage.RTYoyteEKY7EOhy2]{Dweorg}, 200 freedmen humans, 20 freedman other, 900@UUID[.PmrSWZmvMcJz6g4H#indentured-servitude]{ indentured} humans; 100 indentured others)</p><p><strong>Notable NPCs</strong></p><p><strong>Eseld Penberry, First Speaker</strong> (LN Female halfling aristocrat 9)</p><p><strong>Wren Machek, Freedman Councillor</strong> (NE Male human expert 8/warrior 3)</p><p><strong>@UUID[.D1IrajgFIr9gyZFw#jory-tremorgan]{Jory Tremorgan}, Historian</strong> (NG Male halfling wizard 5/expert 7)</p><p>MARKETPLACE</p><p><strong>Base Value:</strong> 2,600 gp; <strong>Purchase Limit:</strong> 10,000 gp; <strong>Spellcasting:</strong> 5th</p><p><strong>Minor Items:</strong> [[/roll 3d4]]; <strong>Medium Items:</strong> [[/roll 2d4]]; Major Items [[/roll 1d4]]</p><p>Located at the mouth of the Marigold river, the nine villages that host the @UUID[.X0uyBqIKLevC15mx#the-eldermoot]{Eldermoot}, @UUID[.X0uyBqIKLevC15mx#board-of-indentures-and-the-council-of-freedmen]{Board of Indentures}, and the@UUID[.X0uyBqIKLevC15mx#board-of-indentures-and-the-council-of-freedmen]{ Council of Freedmen} consist of a deepwater port, milling villages along the river, fishing villages up and down the coast, and farming villages, all within half a day’s travel of each other.

Situated across the river from Scrivenston, this village of some 120 souls contains some of the wealthiest freedmen in Picollo. Many owe their riches to a term of service on the Council of Freedmen (with its attendant bribes) and some retain considerable political influence. A few of the freedmen in Rivercross keep indentures of their own, and in general indentures and freedmen from other colonies across Picollo hate those who dwell within and all that Rivercross stands for: the perpetuation of the injustices of the halflings’ “peculiar institution”.</p><p></p><h2>The Isles</h2><p>The ancient archipelago once consisted of thousands of smaller islands stretching three thousand miles to the southwest. Only a handful survived the tectonic disturbances and tidal waves that accompanied the fall of the Dracoprime; the highest concentration of these islands are within 300 miles of the southern tip of the big island. The islands vary in habitability from the uninhabited desert island to tropical paradises; the warming ocean currents of the south flow east to west off the southern tip of mainland Picollo. Clans and villages of seaborn halflings are sometimes found on these islands. The most dangerous stretch of the sea is known as the Spine of the Dragon, where the vertebrae of the Dracoprime pierces the surface of the ocean, creating vicious currents and putting ships at hazard.</p><h2>The Great Mountain</h2><p>The base of the mountain is over 100 miles in diameter, surrounded by rolling hills. No other peaks compete with the seven-mile high summit; the mass that is the Great Mountain is unique. Many valleys and rises, both forested and grassy, lie sheltered on the great slopes of the mountain and alluvial rivers cascade off cliffsides, running swiftly through these vales.

The size of the entrance to the cave as well as a great underground river allows a significant amount of maritime trade to pass through the city, and the dweorg keep a harbor fleet of galleys for defense. Tunnels and avenues lead to the surface, as well as deeper into the mountain itself.</p><p>The dweorg are excellent smiths; magical arms and armor under the base price are more likely to be available in Stoneroot (85%), but staves, rings, wands, rods, and wondrous items are less likely to be available (65%). Most such items are brokered by halfling middlemen who represent zwerc mages from the cloud fortresses above, or on the black market, due to the friction between dweorg and zwerc. Scrolls and potions can be found normally.</p><p>The non-dweorg population of Stoneroot consists of halfling diplomats, merchants, and craftsmen, and their indentured servants (the dweorg do not keep indentures), as well as freedmen. Many abolitionist societies use this city as a base of operations, due to the more egalitarian government of the dwarves.</p><h2>The Great Forest</h2><p>One of the last bastions of resistance during the wars, the Great Forest suffered the least damage from the @UUID[JournalEntry.QlctNkzE9injOde9.JournalEntryPage.SGw7zGFtvjLNPDMY]{Hoyrall} invaders. Though some portions of the perimeter suffered depredation, the interior maintains its primaeval characteristics, guarded and husbanded by the fey living within. Magical and mystical creatures also share the virgin woodland; not all are friendly. In addition to the fey living in the woods, villages of tree-borer halflings can also be found, as well as the scattered humanoid settlements of runaway indentures and independently inclined freedmen.</p><p>The Great Oak of the Mother is located somewhere in the Great Forest. In ancient times, holy druids transplanted acorns from the tree to the central greens of many halfling communities. Only a few of these “Second Growth” trees survive; they are among the most powerful foci of divine magic on the island. The location of the Great Oak has been lost to time—it is rumored that its sacred grove contains a magical gate to the home sanctuary of  @UUID[JournalEntry.dOJJ8mRNTPtoihmF.JournalEntryPage.7JZLaCukpLMqn2R2]{The Mother Spirit}.</p><p></p><p></p></div>","markdown":""},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}},{"sort":800000,"name":"Significant Characters","type":"text","_id":"D1IrajgFIr9gyZFw","title":{"show":false,"level":1},"image":{},"text":{"format":1,"content":"<div class=\"aventyr\">\n<p class=\"s5\">Significant Characters</p>\n<h2>Jory Tremorgan</h2>\n<img style=\"float:right;margin:0px 15px 15px 0px;border:0px\" src=\"modules/aaw-games-aventyr/Setting-images/halfling-Crosseyes.webp\" width=\"146\" height=\"366\" />\n<p><strong>Historian</strong> (NG Male halfling wizard 5/expert 7)</p>\n<p>A member of the @UUID[.X0uyBqIKLevC15mx#board-of-indentures-and-the-council-of-freedmen]{Board of Indentures and the Council of Freedmen}, Tremorgan is almost convinced that the halfling’s “peculiar institution” is leading them away from their heritage.

Most frequently this is during war, where neither the unhelpful morality of good and evil nor the confusion and disorder of chaos allow for clear decisions to be made and victory achieved. The Axiomatic General appears wherever clear-thinking, considered tactics, and balanced plans are being prepared or followed. While the field of war is the usual site for these activities, the Axiomatic General has been known to appear during complicated but emotionless court cases, and sometimes even when the cold, detached clarity of true monkish enlightenment is reached.</p>\n<p>The Axiomatic General is neither male nor female, instead being a creature devoid of physically distracting bias. It can appear as a female or male of any humanoid species, whichever form is most likely to aid with clarity of decision making.</p>\n<h2>Dogma</h2>\n<p>The Axiomatic General and its followers wish to bring the clarity of law to those places that currently live in emotional turmoil and to demonstrate to all the axiomatic nature of law when applied to war, legal frameworks, and personal actions. It expects its believers to instigate and adhere to meaningful laws while at the same time exposing and amending those which are ludicrous, outlandish, convoluted, unenforceable, or contrary. The Overseer of War abhors any decision or process that allows an individual to take unfair advantage of another, either through methods such as emotional blackmail, the abuse of personal power, or as a result of chance. It encourages its followers to engage in long-term ordered “wars” rather than short-and-sharp fights—the chaos of battle is well known, but by carefully considering one’s options, testing one’s theories, and then following through with a well-conceived plan, one can make their way to victory in an ordered manner. If all around them are clear about their intentions, one can see their actions are as fair and just as possible, and that trade and public prosperity, the courts, and the growth of society as a whole can continue during even the greatest of conflicts.</p>\n<p>The Lord of All Wars promotes careful consideration in all matters and expects its followers to be able to provide self-evident truths for all their actions. Haste, guesswork, and self-indulgence lead to reliance on emotion and base, uncontrolled actions. It disapproves of reliance on government or any religious institution that fosters blind trust or, even worse, unprovable belief, explaining that those with sound judgement, mental discipline, and an unshakeable grasp of sensible, irrefutable laws can overcome the inauthentic evidence and invalid arguments of the emotional and chaotic masses.</p>\n<h2>History</h2>\n<p>Once a mortal humanoid, the Axiomatic General ascended to become deified, although it is unclear what exactly it once was as virtually all races have a legendary historical figure that has risen from the mortal ranks to those of the divine after following the path of a great warrior who tirelessly supported its deity. What is evident is that the Overseer of War became more powerful than this original deity and ended up judging it at the culmination of a long conflict. The Lord of All War’s final verdict and victory provided the energy and evidence needed for the warrior to rise to godhood itself.</p>\n<p>The Axiomatic General tends to appear in history (as the simple warrior of its humanoid type) when the race’s pre-eminent lawful deity first wages war against more than one non-lawful foe, whether they be good, evil, or chaotic. It goes by many titles (a few of which appear above) but always has the ability to make clear, concise, and entirely accurate decisions even in the heat and fog of combat. Tales invariably tell of the Overseer of War having to uphold the lawful aims and ambitions of another deity’s followers when the god or goddess itself proves to be weak and fallible. Then the Axiomatic General steps in to save those same worshipers before judging the god in question and finding it wanting. After this, it takes the fight to the enemy, turns the tide of the war with unquestionable judgement, and becomes a deity in its own right. After this, the Lord of All Wars is always found leading those who know its words to be the truth through conflict, disagreement, and dispute—a reliable route to absolute, undeniable victory.</p>\n<h2>Relationships</h2>\n<p>The Overseer of War is entirely dismissive of any and all other deities that do not in some part embrace lawful beliefs. While those that promote chaos feel its full wrath, the Axiomatic General constantly seeks to disprove the tenets of neutral good and neutral evil deities because of their reliance on sentimental or self-centred emotions. It tolerates lawful good and lawful evil gods as long as their lawful nature is at the forefront of their actions, and is just as likely to support a lawfully-minded archon in a conflict against an evil devil as it is a lawfully-minded devil that wages war against an overly-good archon; ultimately, the balance of law is what is important.</p>\n<p>The Axiomatic General is opposed by all those who promote personal choice, uncontrolled actions, and “belief”—it is guaranteed to come into conflict with deities that support and nurture bards and barbarians, and frequently with those that nurture wild sorcerers. Because it is so closely linked with conclusive and categorical truth, the Lord of All Wars sometimes finds itself on the side of sages, experts, philosophers and academics that devote their lives to uncovering a lost or hidden truth, whether military, legal, commercial, or magical.</p>\n<h2>Appearance</h2>\n<p>The Axiomatic General usually appears as a healthy, vibrant member of the appropriate race and can be either female or male (or neither). Its clothing is always practical for the situation but is clearly designed to instil confidence and invariably a bright white. The god’s symbol, the decorated iron rod, is sewn into the space above the heart and mimicked by the weapon it wields. The Overseer of War always carries a +3 axiomatic brilliant energy light mace, the look and effect of which are in line with the main domain of the senior cleric in the vicinity as follows:</p>\n<table style=\"float:left;width:99.5833%;height:113px\" border=\"1\">\n<tbody>\n<tr style=\"height:32.5px\">\n<td style=\"width:47.7664%;height:32.5px;background-color:#000000;border-color:#ffffff\">\n<h3><span style=\"color:#ffffff\"><strong>Domain</strong></span></h3>\n</td>\n<td style=\"width:52.2358%;height:32.5px;background-color:#000000;border-color:#ffffff\">\n<h3><span style=\"color:#ffffff\"><strong>Rod type</strong></span></h3>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height:20.125px\">\n<td style=\"width:47.7664%;height:20.125px;background-color:#ecf0f1;border-color:#000000\">Law</td>\n<td style=\"width:52.2358%;height:20.125px;background-color:#ecf0f1;border-color:#000000\">Alertness</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height:20.125px\">\n<td style=\"width:47.7664%;height:20.125px;background-color:#ecf0f1;border-color:#000000\">Nobility</td>\n<td style=\"width:52.2358%;height:20.125px;background-color:#ecf0f1;border-color:#000000\">Splendour</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height:20.125px\">\n<td style=\"width:47.7664%;height:20.125px;background-color:#ecf0f1;border-color:#000000\">Strength</td>\n<td style=\"width:52.2358%;height:20.125px;background-color:#ecf0f1;border-color:#000000\">Flailing</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height:20.125px\">\n<td style=\"width:47.7664%;height:20.125px;background-color:#ecf0f1;border-color:#000000\">War</td>\n<td style=\"width:52.2358%;height:20.125px;background-color:#ecf0f1;border-color:#000000\">Rulership</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>Legends dictate that the Axiomatic General occasionally appears as a fully advanced, adamantine-coated marut, but the last occasion this was recorded was many generations ago.</p>\n<h2>Providence</h2>\n<p>Followers and clergy of the Lord of All Wars know that clarity of planning, deeper understanding of the way forward, or insight into a problem that has been gained after careful thought and consideration has come from their deity. This knowledge doesn’t appear suddenly but is the reward for taking time and exploring all possibilities. The Oversee of War thinks highly of those who consider their options before acting decisively, as well as of those who follow through with long-term plans without faltering.</p>\n<p>Any sign of plans failing, the confusion reigning, or participants not understanding their role is seen as a sign that the Axiomatic General is displeased and expects greater discipline and forethought.</p>\n<h2>Servants</h2>\n<p>The Axiomatic General rewards those who organize well and keep to agreed plans, no matter how long this may take. These machinations often take many generations in the case of shorter-lived humanoids such as goblinoids and humans, or the entire life of the longest-living elves. Servants must be prepared to sacrifice the immediate for the longer term, understand that they may lose those around them today for the betterment of a lawful population tomorrow, and recognize that the needs of a lawful future outweigh any considerations here and now.</p>\n<p>The Overseer of War grants particular favour to those who constantly uphold the law—inevitables are viewed with esteem alongside formians and other hive-minded creatures. Followers that devote themselves to a lifetime of achieving a long-term lawful aim regularly receive insight and clarity from their god. Humanoids that either spend a significant portion of their time gaining greater insight into a particular path or are able to rapidly judge the features and benefits of a number of possibilities before quickly making the correct decision often gain a divine hint or two.</p>\n<h2>The Church of the Axiomatic General</h2>\n<p>Sites of worship to the Lord of All Wars serve one purpose: to ensure that correct decision are made to further indisputable truth. They range in size from an officer’s table in their tent, a simple sand tablet on which a cleric explains a truth, or in a lawyer’s or sage’s rooms, to the chambers of a country’s most magnificent courtroom, the order flags at the front line of the latest battle in a war, or the grandest library within the @UUID[JournalEntry.QVrlu0lTv2vFtT5P]{Klavek Kingdom} most spectacular cathedral to the Axiomatic General. Churches to this god are all simple, plain affairs that remove mental distraction and clutter at the same time as allowing axioms and tenets spoken by the Overseer of War to be spread effectively and efficiently.</p>\n<p>Worship of the Axiomatic General is frequently silent as followers consider practical issues at hand as well as long-term problems that require a more considered solution. Followers frequently engage in debates, most of which are serious but enjoyable affairs—there is no time for frivolous thought when the Lord of All War’s tenets are involved—although there is no sense of “victory or defeat” in these sessions (the aim is to reach the truest, most accurate solution to a question, and everybody learns something.) When necessary, churches of the Overseer of War provide a neutral meeting point between warring factions of good and evil, although only the most experienced and senior of clergy attempt to mediate between chaotic elements. The Axiomatic General has shown that the wisest course for followers of law is to work together to overcome chaos through any means possible before resolving philosophical and personal lawful differences using contemplation and debate.</p>\n<p>The clergy of the Overseer of War organize themselves in a clear and obvious hierarchy in the same way that any modern military, business, or courtroom would do. Similarly, religious and educational centres that follow the Axiomatic General have a plain structure in place that shows who has best demonstrated an understanding of the god’s aims and objectives. No matter where or how the Lord of All War is followed, its churches are defined by their grasp of unequivocal truths, unimpeachable laws, unbeatable tactics, and unquestionable enlightenment. Churches that exhibit knowledge over belief and can demonstrate undeniable evidence for these truths have the greatest standing, no matter what their size. Worshipers rise up the ranks in the same way: anyone who can establish irrefutable knowledge and information is given ever greater responsibilities. At the same time, mistakes aren’t considered a failure if the individuals concerned can show they did all they could to establish clarity and a considered answer. All they have to do is recognize that further investigation has produced better knowledge and make sure they don’t repeat the mistake. As the Lord of All Wars is happy to develop plans over many generations, errors that can be rectified bear little consequence.</p>\n<p>Churches worshipping the Axiomatic General are openly found in the centre of lawful societies and on the outskirts of those populations with no preference for law or chaos but are seemingly absent from chaotic cultures. The Overseer of War prefers his followers to surround such cultures and gradually move inwards until the chaos is crushed out of them—a process that takes as long as is necessary, designed to ensure no worshiper is tricked into joining chaos from within.</p>\n<p>Services to the Axiomatic General are ordered affairs, comprising either contemplation of the truth or respectful presentation of findings and subsequent decision-making they influence. In all situations, there is ample opportunity for everyone who wants to speak to do so, although followers recognize the need to act swiftly during war situations and develop a truncated, precise style of presenting their findings.</p>\n<h2>Worshipers</h2>\n<p>The Axiomatic General is primarily worshipped by military officers but also draws in judges, lawyers, barristers, sages, monks, and those who would advance society in an ordered and structured way. Those who indulge in chaotic thoughts and acts are ignored at all times.</p>\n<h2>Clergy</h2>\n<p>The clergy of the Overseer of War are not necessarily clerics, although if they aren’t they are only allowed to represent the god within their own sphere of expertise and influence (for example, military officers can only lead services and discussions about military matters). Any member of the clergy who is a cleric is required to lead a service in an overarching capacity even if the content is decided by the senior subject expert. In all situations, the most experience cleric leads a service, with assistance as appropriate from other members of the congregation.</p>\n<p>The Axiomatic General does not support paladins, despite their martial outlook. Their tendency towards good leads them to not always consider the balanced needs of a lawful life, which in turn means their judgment isn’t always going to be the best it can be in some situations.</p>\n<h2>Temples and Shrines</h2>\n<p>Buildings devoted to the Lord of All Wars are functional, unadorned, designed to serve all aspects of the god’s tenets, yet clearly focused on one domain more than others (whatever that may be). It isn’t unusual for there to be four temples next to each other—one for each aspect of devotion with followers visiting whichever is most appropriate for their needs.</p>\n<p>All sites of worship have one item in common: a magical lead box with an amazing lock that holds a copy of the four holy texts of the Axiomatic General (The Four Planes of Certain Truth) plus one additional book of specific thoughts on the area of expertise of the congregation. These boxes are identical as adornment or elaboration is forbidden as an unnecessary distraction, and are always at the centre of any service of worship or decision-making process. Whenever the box is locked after its final use for the day, the text within each book is updated via divine intervention if a more accurate and truthful version of any piece of information has been discovered and when new facts have been uncovered.</p>\n<p>Each place of worship also contains the thought processes of anyone who has worked to uncover indisputable truths, as well as the evidence that demonstrates that truth. Whenever someone is uncovering a new truth, their work-in-progress materials are stored here as well.</p>\n<h2>Holy Texts</h2>\n<p>The Four Planes of Certain Truth contain the pertinent and unequivocal statements confirmed by the Axiomatic General. When stored in their magical box they are updated via divine intervention when it is locked at the end of the day. No decision is made without this box being present, even if it isn’t used. Clerics of the Overseer of War receive notification of changes as part of their meditation; all clerics and service leaders are encouraged to learn the texts by heart (as interpretation isn’t required).</p>\n<p>Each book bears a simple cover, binding, and little decoration other than an iron rod over a stylized letter that identifies its contents.

The core content—when consulted prior to a battle—confers both a confidence-boosting and calming effect as it confirms how its actions bring eventual victory in the war (with that day’s battle an important part of it). Chapters detail the stages of engagement and explain the surest way forward at each point. They describe how a lawful plan can be overcome by the sheer weight of chaos, but also how to learn from that experience and counter it in the next battle.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<h3><em><strong>Axioms of Law</strong></em></h3>\n<p>This contains the latest approved plans for passing legal judgment as a whole, as well as tactics for individual cases. When consulted prior to establishing guilt or innocence, it confers both a clarity- and authority-boosting effect as it confirms how its actions ensure the correct judgment is reached. Chapters detail the stages of ascertaining the truth from all that has been presented as evidence as well as methods to consider it in an effective, efficient, and impartial manner. They also describe how well-made laws can be twisted and broken by the inherently devious, and how to rewrite those laws to ensure this doesn’t happen in future.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<h3><em><strong>Axioms of Decisions</strong></em></h3>\n<p>This contains the latest methods and directions for effective and efficient meditation as well as long-established research techniques from the church’s greatest sages and experts. When consulted before an investigation is started, it confers a mind-clearing and attention-focusing effect as it confirms how its actions allow a user to reveal the most pertinent and accurate information. Chapters detail how to consider what needs to be discovered, how to ensure what is found matches the initial requirements, and then how to use the information to make the correct decision. They also describe how distraction, obfuscation, and distortion of aims and objects (such as shortcuts) lead to an incorrect decision with long-term consequences.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<h3><em><strong>Axioms of Enlightenment</strong></em></h3>\n<p>This contains pathways to understanding the world at large and the part one plays in that world as well as how the best of life is achieved through the order. When consulted before meditating, it confers an open-mindedness that ensures the route to enlightenment is properly followed as it confirms how its actions allow a user to reach self-knowledge without deviation or distraction. Chapters give details on what to do before, during, and after meditation, as well as how to realize enlightenment has been reached. They also describe how our contemplation can be lessened by the actions of others, but how these digressions can be overcome and enlightenment eventually reached.</p>\n<h2>Holidays</h2>\n<p>The Axiomatic General is not celebrated at any specific festivals. Instead, when the law prevails during any of the god’s areas of interest, followers offer a prayer of thanks no more than 30 minutes after the event. If gratitude is shown later than this, it probably means the follower was distracted from the task at hand and has acted in a chaotic way to make the thanks fit in. Better to acknowledge the effect of the Overseer of War with one’s body and mind than take yourself away from a pressing matter and make two situations chaotic.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n</div>","markdown":""},"_id":"OB8fp8gIre5yoZax","image":{},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"sort":400000,"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"JournalEntry.0FSVjV3WkdoAk7OX.JournalEntryPage.K8IEnGHHZ3800Nio"}}},{"name":"Ancestor Spirit","type":"text","title":{"show":false,"level":1},"text":{"format":1,"content":"<div class=\"aventyr\">\n<p class=\"s5\">Ancestor Spirit</p>\n<img style=\"margin:0px 10px 10px 0px;border:0px;float:right\" src=\"modules/aaw-games-aventyr/Deities-Images/waterfall_edit-scaled.webp\" width=\"244\" height=\"698\" />\n<p><strong>Titles: </strong>Breath of Life, Life Spirit</p>\n<p><strong>Home: </strong>Positive energy plane</p>\n<p><strong>Alignment: </strong>NG</p>\n<p><strong>Portfolio: </strong>Ancestor, nature, wilderness, wisdom</p>\n<p><strong>Worshippers:</strong> @UUID[JournalEntry.QlctNkzE9injOde9.JournalEntryPage.I4CpK8rTs0HgD7hW]{Vikmordere}</p>\n<p><strong>Domains: </strong>Animal, Community, Plant</p>\n<p><strong>Subdomains: </strong>Ancestors, Seasons, Souls</p>\n<p><strong>Favored Weapon: </strong>Wooden staff</p>\n<p>The Ancestor Spirit venerates reconnection with nature, and exploration of one’s inner being without the scourge of individual financial gain.</p>\n<p>    The pure energy which forms this deity is comprised of the souls of the original ancient settlers of the @UUID[JournalEntry.QVrlu0lTv2vFtT5P]{Klavek Kingdom}/@UUID[JournalEntry.Cg0Nt8mDPQ7JrmyB]{Vikmordere}.

He was dissatisfied; dwarves had become a lesser race, overcome by the @UUID[JournalEntry.QlctNkzE9injOde9.JournalEntryPage.8HyVcZ70eyhwNJsu]{Drow}, among others. His life was punctuated by constant struggle and heroic feats that are the things of legend: he re-mastered the lost arts of metalworking once known by his ancestors; he defended his homeland single-handedly against creatures of the Underworld, and he built himself a flawless suit of unbreakable armour. Inside this shell, he was an unstoppable force, and Balir took back thousands of miles of once-dwarven lands. He rose higher than any before making the fatal flaw of offering his hand in peace to the drow.</p>\n<p>The story goes that the Drow cast a curse of burning into his unbreakable armour, sealing the dwarf inside and setting it ablaze forever. But at this moment the gods saw Balir as the greatest martyr of his people and granted him a spark of divinity; he awoke as a god, still within the armour that had become his tomb, and departed the mortal realm.</p>\n<p>Having risen from the ranks of mortals, Balir has been forced to prove himself to the gods over and over again, showing them he is worthy. His feats as a god are no less than his feats as a mortal, although they take place in realms far beyond man’s comprehension. It is from one of these divine toils that he claimed his mighty hammer, Soul Forger – a weapon clearly claimed from a creature many times larger than Balir himself.</p>\n<p>Even as he found himself a god, Balir kept his destroyed mortal form as a sign of his penance. Instead of divine flesh, he constructed a metal body for himself to replace the one he lost. This new skin is without the flaw of mercy that destroyed him as a mortal. And although Balir’s scarred face is unmistakably dwarven, his body is anything but. A cast of white mithral and black iron, he appears more machine than man. Now, even with his drow-cursed armour destroyed, he still blazes with the murderous fire; in his chest, he carries a spark from which the sun was born. When he does not appear in his divine form, Balir assumes the guise of a young dwarf, typically bearing scars on his face and arms from flame.</p>\n<h2>Churches, Clergy, and Worshippers</h2>\n<p>Churches to Balir are at once humble and magnificent. Their areas of worship are simple and unadorned, although always practical, in a manner befitting dwarven life itself. Whether the smallest shrine or grandest cathedral, sites dedicated to Balir always stand near a place of work, toil, and creation. In them, they are guided by Balir’s ancient knowledge and secrets to produce machines, mechanical goods, and works of active art unlike anywhere else in the world. Balir’s clergy are predominantly dwarven, although some humans do acclaim his faith as well. Where they can, they dress in mithral and crimson – styling themselves after their god. Poorer members of the faith dress instead in white and yellow. Worshippers almost always offer constructed items as their offering. If they do resort to just money, it’s always directed toward a newly-qualified crafter or a promising apprentice.</p>\n<h2>Holy Text</h2>\n<p>The Life of Balir is unlike any standard book of holy teachings. Instead, this tome is almost three thousand pages long and details the thousand trials and tribulations of Balir’s life, written in such a way that it is more like a dwarven self-help book than divine instruction. Some versions have additional volumes discussing the merits of each action Balir took, although these are known to be opinions, not facts. The original text is unchanged from when it was penned by Balir’s own son, after the dwarf’s ascension to godhood.</p>\n</div>","markdown":""},"_id":"SjKuUjzrx9TNLn0y","image":{},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"sort":500000,"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"JournalEntry.EykWA9hRZOjLFz6G.JournalEntryPage.JtgEqWY5XOkGnzgZ"}}},{"name":"The Current","type":"text","title":{"show":false,"level":1},"text":{"format":1,"content":"<div class=\"aventyr\">\n<p class=\"s5\">The Current</p>\n<img style=\"float:right;margin:0px 10px 10px 0px;border:0px\" src=\"modules/aaw-games-aventyr/Deities-Images/The-Current.webp\" width=\"267\" height=\"316\" />\n<p><strong>Alignment:</strong> LN</p>\n<p><strong>Portfolio:</strong> Insanity, Mysticism, Seas, Underworld Waters, the Unknown</p>\n<p><strong>Domains:</strong> Madness (Nightmare), Magic (Arcane), Void (Dark Tapestry), Water (Oceans)</p>\n<p><strong>Favoured Weapon:</strong> Tentacle (whips, spiked chains)</p>\n<p><strong>Favored Animals:</strong> Octopus, Squid</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>History</h2>\n<p>The other deities of Aventyr are forever vigilant for even the slightest brush of the Current’s tentacles in their plans or near their essence, keeping a respectful distance from the maddening god. Its motives are totally unpredictable, though it strikes swiftly and without warning when it is suited to do so. The affairs of the gods don’t seem to bear any interest to the Current, however, and it is thought to be slumbering, like the massive beasts that lay in the ruins of the vestraadi’s ancient civilizations. Indeed, some believe that these enormous predators are somehow related to the maddening god and not without good reason; they appeared not long after the Current came to Aventyr.</p>\n<h2>Appearance</h2>\n<p>Records of The Current’s appearance are extremely vague by necessity; those that look upon it are driven utterly mad. The few reliable accounts claim that it is floating, slithering or pulsating mass of writhing tentacles, the end of each covered in barbs of colours for which there is no shade or name.</p>\n<h2>Churches of the Maddening God</h2>\n<p>These revered houses of worship completely encompass those within them, covered in sculptures of tentacles that extend throughout the structure. The holiest of these churches are actually made from the recovered limbs of enormous squids and octopuses—the architecture within them drives any non-followers of the Current to madness, afflicting any creature within with a form of insanity should they fail a DC 16 Wisdom saving throw.</p>\n<h2>Holy Text</h2>\n<p>No books exist for the religion of the maddening god; instead, the vestraadi keep song strings. When wound or unwound underwater, these magical cords play hymns of the Current’s religion (in a tongue those that hear them can understand). The holiest and most valuable of these song strings are said to relate the true origins of the aquatic deity but are said to drive those that hear them mad with the voice of the Current, cursed to forever live with its echo in their mind.</p>\n<h2>Vast Swamp</h2>\n<p>@UUID[JournalEntry.g4odaMsHbRkeNFhn.JournalEntryPage.oIbJsrbNZu7GVWp9#the-muddy-mangroves]{The Muddy Mangroves} has always been the center of the Current’s clergy in the Vast Swamp.

The others chose their domains carefully, but Eureum took his from necessity. For, there must be balance in life as there must be balance in death.

It is said, that beneath the cowl, he perpetually weeps.</p>\n<p>   When he does not appear in a humanoid form, he appears as a collection of dry autumn leaves blowing in the wind.</p>\n<h2>Church of Eureum</h2>\n<p>Much to his dismay, most of Eureum’s churches are misguided, focusing only on one aspect – either death or rebirth – and are often fanatical in their beliefs. He considers only a few shrines to him, often deep within forests and away from civilization, to be true churches.</p>\n<h2>Worshippers and Clergy</h2>\n<p>Eureum’s followers are more often fanatics than they are proper clergy, focusing either on bringing either death or life wherever they go instead of maintaining the cycle of life and death.</p>\n<p> His true followers dress in dirty brown robes, often matted with dried leaves and crawling with tiny insects.</p>\n<h2>Holy Text</h2>\n<p>On Death: This book details the cycle of death, and life, and how all life depends on death for sustenance as much as death depends on life – for one is impossible without the other.

Her mother, Laelstra, was the Matron’s personal seeress. Hivaka possessed only the slightest of her mother’s magical abilities, mastering cantrips at an early age, but progressing no further. Being the youngest daughter, barely older than her only brother, and her sisters already being groomed for succession to various positions within the House, Hivaka found herself being used as leverage but almost everyone around her.</p>\n<p>    Hivaka’s father, Elkerd, was first son of House Kilduis, allies of House Ruim. Among Elkerd’s vices was gambling—he never minded losing, as long as fun was had by all. The problems began when he started using House Kildius’ assets to cover his wagers. When he was financially cut off from House Kilduis, he took the step of offering his youngest daughter, Hivaka, to the winner of a game of orbben. When Elkerd lost to Imfein of House Rilyntyl, a rival of House Kilduis, Hivaka was taken from her home by force. Laelstra protested, but there were too many reliable witnesses to the wager for her challenges to hold sway over her Matron. Thus, Hivaka was taken into slavery by House Rilyntyl. Laelstra attempted to buy Hivaka from Imfein, but was rebuffed, as having a bargaining chip against House Kilduis’ ally was worth much more than gold.</p>\n<p>     Aside from the hard labour she and many others were forced to endure, Hivaka was treated well—as well as a slave could be treated, anyway. She took her enforced servitude in stride, seeing as how she had almost never held any power of significance in her life. However, she harboured a hatred for her father, not understanding how a parent could blithely hand over their child’s life to another simply to cover a bet.</p>\n<p>     The guards from House Imfein did not treat her any better or any worse than any of the other slaves. Neither did they prohibit her mother from visiting her occasionally during the evening, as long as no escape attempts were made. They did, however, restrain her from braining her father with her work hammer the one and only time he approached her during a shift of breaking up rocks. If not for the guards, Elkerd would have died violently, but possibly not quickly.</p>\n<p>     Hivaka was a slave of House Imfein for almost a full year before Laelstra recruited a large following and put a plan into action that would free Hivak: she and her cohort would attack the Imfein guards at the slave pens during the night and Hivak would escape in the confusion while wearing the battle-dress of a House Imfein sorceress.</p>\n<p>      The assault appeared to be a success as chaos reigned in the slave pens, however, Laelstra had not anticipated two things: first, there were more guards than anticipated, causing longer holdups and more casualties as the attacking mob progressed. More guards also meant that an alarm could be sounded, bringing reinforcements, which compounded the existing issues with the rescue.</p>\n<p>    The second issue was that Hivaka had determined that no matter where she was in drow society, she would be enslaved. Either to another house or within her own, where she would be used as a pawn in countless numbers of schemes by her Matron and her own family. As the youngest daughter, she held the lowest standing. Because of this, she was determined not to return to her home.</p>\n<p>    Once in possession of the Imfein battle dress, Hivaka pulled the attached hood over her head and began leading slaves away, using her implied authority, along with some well-placed and spectacular-looking cantrips, to move them without interference. She had nearly one hundred slaves with her when they left the Xdot border.</p>\n<p>   Leading them on through the night, Hivaka found a narrow cave entrance that led into a larger cavern inside. Using the last of her available magicks, Hivaka attempted to cover the mouth of the cave with an illusion showing solid rock. The image was far more effective than Hivak knew because she and her group had attracted the attention of @UUID[.2MMXPI4kINBOYNOP]{Leacim}, the only known male drow deity.</p>\n<p>     A trickster among the more serious drow goddesses, @UUID[.2MMXPI4kINBOYNOP]{Leacim} took this opportunity to thumb his nose at his sisters and to have fun, watching as the drow patrols searched the area over and over, never seeing past his illusions.</p>\n<p>     The rescued slaves began worshipping Hivaka as a saviour. She resisted their praise, saying that she was simply another slave, like them. Leacim—knowing that these slaves needed someone to look up to, invested a small amount of his power in Hivaka, raising her above the mortals, but not so high as the divine: he made her a demigoddess.</p>\n<p>     Those under her protection turned their new home into a town, called Nhlilolin, which has become a haven for the outcasts of the Underworld.</p>\n<h2>Appearance</h2>\n<p>Hivaka is short, for a drow, but heavily muscled from her time as a slave. Her light grey hair is kept short for a drow female, the ends reaching her jawline. Her eyes are blue, relatively rare in the Underworld, and if you look into them, you will find nothing but steely resolve.</p>\n<p>   Hivaka keeps her clothes simple, preferring pants and shirts that have pockets. The more pockets, the better. She is never anywhere without the hammer that she used to break the chains of the other slaves before leading them off into the night. Every morning or after any combat, she repairs the wooden handle with the mending cantrip.</p>\n<h2>Church of Hivaka</h2>\n<p>Hivaka, as a very recent demigoddess, does not have a church, but those that were rescued from imprisonment literally sing her praises every day. She downplays her role as a saviour or someone to be worshipped. She does have her devoted followers and, thanks to @UUID[.2MMXPI4kINBOYNOP]{Leacim}, she is able to grant them a small number of spells. She has not gained any paladins, though.</p>\n<h2>Worshippers and Clergy</h2>\n<p>Those who escaped with Hivaka are her greatest worshippers, but any who have escaped bondage freely speak her name with reverence. There is no set clergy in Nhilolin, but some apostles go out into the Underworld (and a few to the Upperworld) and speak against slavery, striving to free those that are held down, if only through word if not deed.</p>\n<p>     Some of these preachers will gather the like-minded with them and attempt to free those taken by slavers. These zealots do not care if they live or die, as long as those imprisoned go free.</p>\n<h2>Holy Text</h2>\n<p>The Journey: The only text that Hivaka doesn’t simply shake her head at is The Journey. This collection of parchments is the story of not only Hivaka leading the slaves of House Imfein to freedom, but every person who has escaped from an overlord is welcome to add their story to The Journey. So far, almost three hundred stories have been put into the collection.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>A second “holy text” has begun circulating throughout Nhilolin and the Underworld, speaking of Hivaka in the holiest of languages, greatly exaggerating her abilities, and almost, but not quite, painting her as the goddess who will eventually overthrow the mightiest of slavers, Naraneus herself. Hivaka has tried to explain that the book, The Light of Hivaka and the Way Forward, brings attention to her and the town, which is mentioned by name in the book, and could lead to them all being recaptured. This explanation has failed, so far.</p>\n<p> </p>\n</div>","markdown":""},"_id":"fGrUoxdeUcElXl1w","image":{},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"sort":1000000,"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"JournalEntry.0ZJ73TBS2gtaaHzz.JournalEntryPage.8ICOLekqb9Rv4c6W"}}},{"name":"Ja Qua","type":"text","title":{"show":true,"level":1},"text":{"format":1,"content":"<div class=\"aventyr\">\n<p class=\"s5\">Ja Qua</p>\n<img style=\"float:right;margin:0px 10px 10px 0px;border:0px\" src=\"modules/aaw-games-aventyr/Deities-Images/Ja-Qua.webp\" width=\"263\" height=\"235\" />\n<p><strong>Titles: </strong>Mother, Jaguar Queen, Heart of the Jungle, She Behind the Leaves</p>\n<p><strong>Home: </strong>The Fey Jungle</p>\n<p><strong>Alignment </strong>LN</p>\n<p><strong>Portfolio: </strong>Strength, The Hunt, Family</p>\n<p><strong>Worshippers:</strong> Actively worshipped by many natives of @UUID[JournalEntry.RMK7HBFDlPXDiURg]{NairaCull}</p>\n<p><strong>Domains: </strong>Strength, Animal, Law, Protection</p>\n<p><strong>Subdomains: </strong>Ferocity, Fur, Resolve</p>\n<p><strong>Favoured</strong> <strong>Weapon:</strong> Natural Claws, Maquahuitl</p>\n<p>Considered by a vast majority of the native peoples of NairaCull to be she who controls the balance of life within their lands, the worship of Ja Qua is the dominant faith within the dark nation.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>History</h2>\n<p>Ja Qua herself predates most written language, and her own followers have spent their entire lives passing down the tales told to them from previous generations, leaving her history entirely in the hands of those who revere her. Little is known to her followers of her true origins, only that she has proven to be an active and loyal spiritual force within the lives of those who never looked away from the older forms of worship.</p>\n<p>   Ja Qua exists within a sub-dimension connected to the mainlands of the Seelie Court and has fostered a deep relationship with the fey of her lands, looking upon them with the same love and care as her human followers. In turn, the fey has come to view her as one of their own and a revered person of power amongst their courts, and will not hesitate to interact on her behalf within her lands.</p>\n<h2>Appearance</h2>\n<p>Ja Qua appears in one of two forms when she chooses to appear at all. The first is that of a monstrously large and physically powerful jaguar, golden tawny in colour with spots that appear to shift and move before one’s eyes. Crowned with a rim of bony protrusions across her brow and snout, there is no mistaking Ja Qua in her feline form as the self-appointed Queen of her lands. Her second form is one of far more subtlety, one of an attractive woman, typically still keeping the tawny colour of her pelt within her long hair. The colour of her eyes in human form is said to be indescribable, as no true colour exists within nature to compare them to, and her voice will both seduce and petrify you with fear in the same instant.</p>\n<h2>Church of Ja Qua</h2>\n<p>Ja Qua’s worship is strongest within the lands of @UUID[JournalEntry.RMK7HBFDlPXDiURg]{NaeraCull}, though there is the random shrine amongst a few forgotten uncivilized locations, where the march of progress has not severed all of humanity's connection to the Seelie Court yet.</p>\n<h2>Worshippers and Clergy</h2>\n<p>Those tribal warriors deemed worthy are put through a ritualistic challenge to earn Ja Qua’s Blessing, the gift of lycanthropy. Those who survive the process of transformation, and are not driven mad by the ritualistic pain they must go through to prove their worth find themselves in a position of honour amongst the tribes and temples, utilized as guardians and hunters, protecting both the faith and an ancient way of life. Dressed in only a loincloth these warriors tend to embrace the custom of adorning themselves with colourful trinkets and baubles to mark victories over adversaries, or glorious hunts.</p>\n<p>    Those of great enough faith, but not physical stamina to serve the tribes as warriors tend the temples and altars of Ja Qua as her loyal clerics. Over time those of the deepest devotion begin to acquire certain feline traits, though they never achieve the full embrace of Ja Qua as the temple warriors do.</p>\n<h2>Holy Text</h2>\n<p>Scattered throughout the jungle are many lost ruins of forgotten tribes, within which are wall carvings and bas-reliefs depicting the teachings of various points in the history of the church of Ja Qua. Most of the written language of the people of NairaCull is pictographic and has never been compiled into text or bound format, although it is rumoured that a man travels the jungle seeking to do just that.</p>\n<h2>The Dralman Documents</h2>\n<p>A skald of some renown, Theo Dralman was quested by the Grand University of @UUID[JournalEntry.QVrlu0lTv2vFtT5P.JournalEntryPage.dwAJ5Jtc6ii8zQoh]{Mohkba} to enter the dark jungle and learn all he could of the spirits to which the native people prayed, and how the @UUID[JournalEntry.QVrlu0lTv2vFtT5P]{Klavek Kingdom} could use this information to its own end. That was many years ago, and many of the legends spoken amongst the tribes that have encountered Dralman would lead one to believe that his goals have changed, and his search for knowledge has become something far more personal. Most of the legends speak of a man carrying a great many scars, as if he had been mauled to the edge of death, only to be spared and shown a new path. There exist a few rare copies of his incomplete work, taken to the coastal towns by couriers and those on safari…the Dralman Documents they have become known as. All public possession of these documents within the borders of Klavekian-controlled lands is considered treasonous and punishable by seizure of properties and goods, as well as incarceration.</p>\n<p> </p>\n</div>","markdown":""},"_id":"21VmQoL4MPe6mX6q","image":{},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"sort":1100000,"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"JournalEntry.LQT16PQtjrxETCAe.JournalEntryPage.3JNs1m50QSpNDrdf"}}},{"name":"Leacim","type":"text","title":{"show":false,"level":1},"text":{"format":1,"content":"<div class=\"aventyr\">\n<p class=\"s5\">Leacim</p>\n<img style=\"float:right;margin:0px 10px 10px 0px;border:0px\" src=\"modules/aaw-games-aventyr/Deities-Images/Leacim.webp\" width=\"262\" height=\"371\" />\n<p><strong>Titles: </strong>The Clever Shadow</p>\n<p><strong>Symbol: </strong>Spinning 8-faceted gem</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary)\"><strong style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">Alignment: </strong>CN</span></p>\n<p><strong>Portfolio: </strong>Chance, Guile, Illusion, Misfortune, Self-Determination, Thieves</p>\n<p><strong>Domains: </strong>Chaos, Entropy, Deception, Luck, Trickery</p>\n<p><strong>Favoured</strong> <strong>Weapon:</strong> Scimitar, Shortbow, Throwing Knife</p>\n<p><strong>Favoured Animals:</strong> Any beast with camouflage or mimicry (such as a chameleon, stick bug, etc)</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>History</h2>\n<p>The Aventyr god known as Leacim was once a forgotten deity, supplanted by the doings of the colloid aeons before it ever reached the Underworld. Once a treasured god of cunning and wisdom, he was left bereft in the void of the cosmos—when Leacim stared into the void, something from the far beyond stared back. Now slightly deranged and without an identity, the god capered throughout the universe with a will and desire at the whim of his growing insanity.</p>\n<p>   Eventually, the divine energies wrought on Aventyr during the Forging of the Dvergr caught Leacim’s attention, drawing him to the periphery of the world to witness the rise of the progenitors and their fall into the draaki. It was the elven deities, however, that most interested the god of misfortune—over hundreds of years, he subtly infiltrated their pantheon and species, attributing fanatical devotees in the very flesh before spreading them across both Upper- and Underworld. He appeared inexplicably among the elven pantheon, fully adopting the drow form and gathering followers both before and after their exodus from Edhellond.</p>\n<p>     The most famous of these followers is @UUID[.fGrUoxdeUcElXl1w]{Hivaka} , the Savior of the Masses. Leacim took notice when she and her fellow slaves took flight from Xdot. He imparted the aspiring dark elf with some of his divine essences, forever transforming her into a demigoddess.</p>\n<p>   Leacim continues to take an active (albeit underhanded) role in the continued existence of the drow. He travels through the Underworld, briefly touching the souls of dark elves and morphing their alignments towards chaos, neutrality or even goodness if it suits his mood. The lone raider D’thul, a cannibalistic sorcerer-barbarian in the Fungi Forest near Holoth, is one such drow. Those on the surface often see their lives subtly influenced by the trickster god, and Leacim leads them to roles of dubious natures and unexpected rewards.</p>\n<h2>Special</h2>\n<p>Leacim takes delight in angering the other @UUID[JournalEntry.QlctNkzE9injOde9.JournalEntryPage.8HyVcZ70eyhwNJsu]{Drow} gods at every opportunity; his followers may substitute Leacim as the required diety for any item, class, feat or spell that has a drow deity requirement and may select the Drow domain if they have access to domains. Moreover, he often creates his own agents of change—players that wish to play a drow of good alignment in a place that would otherwise prohibit that choice may choose Leacim as their deity to avoid that caveat.</p>\n<h2>Appearance</h2>\n<p>The trickster god has numerous guises but he most commonly appears as an affably dressed male half-drow with an alluring grin or a blonde human girl, regardless of form, both have piercing blue eyes. Leacim’s clothing is generally fashionable and appropriate for the environment, though it is sometimes slightly tattered and seemingly in a state of disrepair. He casually saunters seemingly without a care in the world, a scimitar on his side and a black-lacquered short bow across his back, in the female form he carries only a single knife as a weapon which always returns to him when thrown.</p>\n<h2>Shrines to the Trickster</h2>\n<p>Leacim doesn’t have proper churches—effigies and the like are hidden in plain sight or are places of secret pilgrimage. These shrines are often made to look like they belong to other deities, and only show their true forms when the correct prayers are uttered. Followers that fail a DC 28 Knowledge (religion) check find their god distempered with them after praying at one of these shrines, though they remain unsure as to why (regardless of any divination spells they cast).</p>\n<h2>Holy Text</h2>\n<p>Leacim’s Lexicon is a treasured tome among thieves’ guilds, hidden drow enclaves and the trickster god’s followers. These books appear as unremarkable journals of unremarkable lives to followers of other deities (DC 26 Wisdom saving throw to negate) but in the hands of a devoted acolyte, provide a means to learn any rogue trick, illusion spell, or access to knowledge of prestige classes that require sneak attack as a prerequisite.</p>\n<h2>The Vast Swamp</h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:Signika, sans-serif\">Leahcim has taken root in the @UUID[JournalEntry.g4odaMsHbRkeNFhn]{Vast Swamp}, his trickster ways helping some daredevil rogues on their quest to lessen the burden of treasure on the vile dragons. It must be added that the tales of the rogues have become known but so far none have surfaced to verify these claims. Recently some inhabitants in the marshes have voiced their concerns—that these rumors are merely planted by Leahcim himself for some unknown reason—but the trickster god has plans and schemes no mere mortal can hope to discern.</span></p>\n</div>","markdown":""},"_id":"2MMXPI4kINBOYNOP","image":{},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"sort":1200000,"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"JournalEntry.fAaBvRaalStVHLAa.JournalEntryPage.CYEQQN8Bs7oSr3YE"}}},{"name":"Musta’Vohi","type":"text","title":{"show":false,"level":1},"text":{"format":1,"content":"<div class=\"aventyr\"><p class=\"s5\">Musta’Vohi</p><p><strong>Titles: </strong>God Mother, Heavenly Concubine</p><p><strong>Homel: </strong>Everywhere</p><p><strong>Symbol: </strong>A goat’s head painted black</p><p><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary)\"><strong style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">Alignment: </strong>NE</span></p><p><strong>Portfolio: </strong>Birth, Health, Motherhood, Lust, Pregnancy</p><p><strong>Domains: </strong>Charm, Darkness, Healing, Protection</p><p><strong>Favoured</strong> <strong>Weapon:</strong> Spiked chain</p><p> </p><h2>History</h2><p>According to the @UUID[JournalEntry.dHHrcptCELfN05gb.JournalEntryPage.Tc1kTiX3bvQt4Jd7]{Yerek}, Musta’Vohi created the universe from the sheer will to reproduce.

She wears a simple brown shawl over a simple brown cloak that has the hood pulled back. Her feet are bare and her hands are always opening and closing as if trying to grasp something.</p><h2>Church</h2><p>There is no physical church of Musta’Vohi.

This light both warmed the cosmos and struck out against the darkness that also appeared. This light, both protective and aggressive is embodied in Naneth. She is both Leaf Mother and Warrior Mother.</p>\n<p>   Naneth (NAH neth), her sister @UUID[.leuKpASroHy7r6sn]{Naraneus}, and their brother @UUID[.zNH5DtHDKD52Ufaf]{Onael} created the first elves. Naneth comforted and warmed the elves, but she also taught them to defend themselves. She showed them to care for each other and themselves, but they only had each other to rely on. As the elves evolved, she became more of a mothering figure to them, offsetting the chaotic presence of Naraneus, while Onael drifted away from the family.</p>\n<p>    Eventually, Naraneus became jealous of Naneth’s mothering ways and began a feud between the two that would last for ages and eventually encompass the elves as well, two groups choosing a deity to follow. Naraneus lost and the elves that followed her were banished from Edhellond.</p>\n<p>    Once the war was over, Naneth reflected on Naraneus’s deceit. She decided that if she could not trust her own sister, her children couldn’t trust anyone else. She instructed the Matriarch to retreat completely within @UUID[JournalEntry.wVQiwLZtRuaqbpFA]{Edhellond, the Silent Forest}.</p>\n<p>    Trade relations with the other races suddenly ceased and there was no response from envoys sent to the elves. The entire elven society retreated into Edhellond, turning entirely to hunting, agriculture, and magic; forsaking any trade or relations with other races.</p>\n<p>   Naneth taught the elves that they were to rely only on themselves for everything. There would be no trade, no exchanges of information, no envoys allowed inside Edhellond and only those on secret missions benefiting elvish society were allowed to venture out from Edhellond.</p>\n<h2>Appearance</h2>\n<p>Naneth appears in two forms, befitting her dual nature. In her Asaya Naneth (Leaf Mother) form, she appears as a motherly female Elf, with long golden hair that reaches the ground and she always carries a basket of bright blue flowers. In her Maethor Naneth (Warrior Mother) guise, she appears as a tall, stout elf, dressed in leather armour and a small cap keeping her jet black hair out of the way. Regardless of how she dresses, she has a pin of her symbol at the neck of her garment. She always carries a shield that is designed to look like her symbol.</p>\n<p>    She can change between the two forms in the blink of an eye.</p>\n<h2>Church of Naneth</h2>\n<p>Naneth’s “church” is more of an outdoor shrine at the largest maple tree in the Silent Forest, Tal. Edhellond is a theocracy, led by the current Matriarch or Patriarch, who also leads the services to Naneth.</p>\n<h2>Worshippers and Clergy</h2>\n<p>All surface elves worship Naneth in either of her two forms and worship of both is the norm. Clergy outside of the Matriarch/Patriarch and the Cleric of Naneth selected by the ruler are treated equally regardless of power level or ability. The motto of the clergy is “We only have ourselves” so they do not discriminate in any way.</p>\n<h2>Holy Text</h2>\n<p>The Triploid Text: This tome is separated into sections of three, with each section beginning with a parable of Asaya Naneth, ending with a parable of Maethon Naneth, and the middle section being descriptions of the war between the elves and between Naneth and @UUID[.leuKpASroHy7r6sn]{Naraneus}.</p>\n<p>The cover of the copy that belongs to the Matriarch or Patriarch is created from several massive maple leaves.

Others claim it is the essence of the Honningsop Mushroom, the oldest living thing on the planet, elevated to godhood from the residual divine energies wrought throughout history. Its awakening may not have been caused by the pantheon’s doings, but its emergence seems to coincide with The Grand Sculpting and the Great Schism.</p>\n<p>As the endless caves of the Underworld expanded, vast chambers filled with moisture risen from tunnels hundreds of miles away, creating damp caverns of moist earth. The Natural Force seeded the subterranean breezes with its spores, creating the mushroom jungles and fungal forests of Aventyr. More than that, some of these spores carried the very children of the deity—intelligent, benevolent plant humanoids known as @UUID[JournalEntry.QlctNkzE9injOde9.JournalEntryPage.yv3q3b1HnUnZB2OT]{Funglet}.</p>\n<p>The divine beings of Aventyr generally regard the great nature deity of the Underworld with a measure of respect, if they acknowledge it at all. It answers the calls of its followers but is remarkably slow to act openly, playing the great game of the gods with a level of detachment and planning that no other deity can fathom.</p>\n<h2>Appearance</h2>\n<p>When the Natural Force does appear (which is extremely rare), it does so as a @UUID[JournalEntry.QlctNkzE9injOde9.JournalEntryPage.yv3q3b1HnUnZB2OT]{Funglet} of enormous height, colored in a kaleidoscopic mixture of all the different subtypes and carrying a gigantic club made from a fantafungi. Every patch of earth the Natural Force touches erupts with a random assortment of mushrooms immediately after he breaks contact with it, and all naturally grown barriers part their way for it and take no damage from its passing.</p>\n<h2>Church of the Natural Force</h2>\n<p>Any monument or sculpture of a mushroom serves as a shrine to the Natural Force, though acolytes of the nature deity pray to fungus of large size or greater if they are able to. Sites of particular religious significance always bear an importance to the number three, though none are sure why (save the Natural Force and its wisest adherents, though they have never revealed it).</p>\n<h2>Holy Text</h2>\n<p>The Libre Boletus is a tome crafted from boletann pages. Anyone that casually skims the book sees nothing but simple gardening tips to encourage the growth of mushrooms, but should they read it fully through, the pages transform to explain the tenets of the Natural Force’s faith.

Together, they created the beings that would become knows at elves. @UUID[.oyFVdicDq8mbjOWw]{Naneth} provided the loving and mothering aspect. She showed them how to care for and protect each other, teaching them skills they needed to survive. @UUID[.leuKpASroHy7r6sn]{Naraneus} provided the chaos that seemed to pervade this new world and taught the elves about death and destruction and how to kill for food. Onael provided the controlling aspect, teaching the elves that in order to succeed, in spite of the chaos, there needed to be order and control. He taught them leadership and command and that of all the newly formed races, the elves were the greatest of them all.</p><p>    Eventually, over the millennia, the elves evolved away from the controlled savagery and into the form that is more common today. As the world became more ordered, they needed their aggression less and opened themselves up more to the life and magic that surrounded them. Without as much violence, they began to live longer and grew smaller, as their muscles were not needed as much for combat. They understood that they did not need to conquer and control to live in the modern world and accepted their place, arriving in @UUID[JournalEntry.wVQiwLZtRuaqbpFA]{Edhellond}, the Elven land that would become known as the Silent Forest.</p><p>   Onael did not understand. He thought he had taught them correctly. Seeing that the elves had turned their back on him, he took what he considered his “children,” the Edheliast, and retreated from the world to the Forgotten Forest, a demiplane that he considered his home.</p><p>    In the Forgotten Forest, the Edheliast continue to fight for survival, growing bigger, stronger, faster, and more cunning. They fight against animals, magical beasts, and even the souls of dead elves and drow that Onael claims before @UUID[.oyFVdicDq8mbjOWw]{Naneth} or @UUID[.leuKpASroHy7r6sn]{Naraneus} can.</p><p>    Recently, Onael has begun work to reclaim the elves as his own. He has many Edheliast to fight for him and he has created a new beast that will surely be a surprise to the elves.</p><h2>Appearance</h2><p>Onael appears as an Elf of immense size. He stands close to fifteen feet tall and is very heavily muscled. His dark hair is close cropped and shows off a widow’s peak. He is dressed conservatively, wearing only a black tunic with his symbol on the left breast, black pants, and black boots. On his left hip rest his longsword Coiasan.</p><p> Images of @UUID[.oyFVdicDq8mbjOWw]{Naneth}, @UUID[.leuKpASroHy7r6sn]{Naraneus}, and Onael show that there is a sibling similarity between the three, but Onael claims that he has no sisters.</p><h2>Church</h2><p>There is no church of Onael. There are no services or high priests, only combat. The Edheliant serve Onael by fighting and honing their skills.</p><h2>Worshippers and Clergy</h2><p>Every Edheliant worships Onael in trials by combat. The Edheliant dedicate every battle they participate in to Onael’s glory and ask for him to fill their bodies with power to crush their enemies.</p><p>   There is no church hierarchy. Those that Onael graces with the merest fraction of his power use the spells granted to them to enhance the combat abilities of their comrades and themselves. Onael’s clerics call themselves “Sword Arms” and mostly use spells that increase Strength or Constitution but will also make liberal use of Cure spells and Channeling Energy (if Neutral) to make sure they and their comrades can continue fighting.</p><h2>Holy Text</h2><p>None, although any manual that teaches someone a new fighting technique or improves on an existing technique are considered sacred and are kept in a “library” in the middle of the Forgotten Forest.</p><p> This library is really just many piles of books collected from different planes and realms and every book in the collection deals with some sort of combat.

In the time after the Sun Lord brought the warming of the land, Storjeger led numerous hunts into the forest where they killed many animals. In the bounty that was the land warming, they hadn’t realized that they had over-hunted, leaving the land unbalanced. This led to a lack of game when the land began to cool after the Sun Lord’s death.</p><p>      As the tribe began to dwindle due to lack of food in the harsh winter, Storjeger, as thin as the rest of the tribe, went into the forest alone to find what food he could. After several hours, he spotted a large stag with an impressive rack of horns. Sneaking as close as he dared, his hands trembling from hunger, he threw his javelin. It missed badly, but instead of rushing into the woods, the deer turned and looked at Storjeger.</p><p>    The stag turned and walked slowly into the woods with Storjeger close behind. Following the deer for another hour, Storjeger had been led him to a place in the woods he had never been before. In the distance, he saw a herd of deer that numbered in the dozens with many calves. He prepared his javelin, but the deer he had followed looked at him and then knelt down, laying down its head. It was joined by three does, each kneeling down and offering their necks to Storjeger.</p><p>    Storjeger drew his knife and offering thanks to the deer for their sacrifice, killed the four. He took a few small pieces of meat for himself to sustain him for the trip back. He produced a large sack and bundled the three deer into it and tied the bag to his belt. The stag, he hefted onto his shoulders as a sign of respect.</p><p>     He made the walk back to the Skykosh tribe with tears in his eyes as he knew he could provide for his people. On the trip back, Storjeger realized that his people had to live in balance with the animals of the forest in order to make sure this didn’t happen again. As it was partly his fault that the tribe was in such a predicament, Storjeger was determined to protect the balance of the forest.</p><p>     Upon returning to his tribe, he delivered the deer and explained what had happened and what he had seen and the understanding of the balance. He took the head of the stag and created a mask from it and made a coat from the skin. Without another word, Storjeger walked out of the village and into the realm of the gods, making the name Storjeger synonymous with survival and donning the mantle of God of the Hunt.</p><p>    Storjeger (STOR jay ger) almost always appears as a giant elk but sometimes manifests as a thin warrior of medium height with a stag’s head and horns. He carries several javelin on his back, a longbow made from Yggdrasil, and three arrows, each unique and powerful.</p><p>      Storjeger was originally worshipped only by the @UUID[JournalEntry.QlctNkzE9injOde9.JournalEntryPage.I4CpK8rTs0HgD7hW]{Vikmordere}, but in a very brief period before the @UUID[JournalEntry.QlctNkzE9injOde9.JournalEntryPage.DXD1ygEckY0JIUFB]{Klavekians} went to war with the Vikmordere, there was an exchange of information, including the tale of Storjeger.

More than a physical being, as the insectoids came to dominate the planet of the alien god’s origin, Zagnexis manifested as the congealed consciousness of their dead. While the other intelligent lifeforms on that world fought valiantly, with a deific being directing the racial hive mind of the @UUID[JournalEntry.QlctNkzE9injOde9.JournalEntryPage.SGw7zGFtvjLNPDMY]{hoyrall}, they quickly came to rule over all that the insect god could perceive.</p>\n<p> Until the Great Schism. The progenitors, cast down from their once mythic forms into the lowly race now known as the draaki, made a desperate cry to the cosmos and it was Zagnexis that answered their plea. Mustering the unimaginable power granted from the complete devotion of an entire race of creatures, the insect god transported his entire physical form into Aventyr—Zagn, along with tens of thousands of hoyrall—directly across the universe and into the Dracoprime’s skull, killing the draconic monstrosity instantly.</p>\n<p>    For some generations, Exis continued to direct its children on Aventyr, growing a massive army within the fortress-hives of the hoyrall in preparation for an all-out assault to conquer both the surface and the Underworld. Were it not for the intervention of the colloid during The Confluence, it surely would have succeeded. The other alien entity seized upon Exis conduit to its children, breaking the hive mind of the hoyrall and sending its physical counterpart, Zagn, careening into the oceans of Aventyr to wreck havoc upon everything it meets.</p>\n<p>    Since then, Exis has retained what connections it can to Aventyr, granting powers to its clerics and oracles but little more. The alien god wants nothing more than to expand and procreate, increasing its deific power by generating a second world of followers. Exis is avaricious and without regard for the general balance of natural powers; it will stop at nothing to re-establish its hold over both Zagn and the hoyrall before consuming all of Aventyr.</p>\n<h2>Appearance</h2>\n<p>Exis is a spectral insect composed of dozens of different arthropods, its countless limbs, heads, eyes and antennae constantly morphing into new shapes or variations. Zagn is an enormous, multi-headed (and multi-mouthed) segmented worm with thousands upon thousands of legs that span a body measured by miles.</p>\n<h2>Church of Zagnexis</h2>\n<p>Temples, churches and shrines devoted to the alien god are commonly found throughout the fortress-hives of the hoyrall and honeycombed into Upperworld mountains, but most are in terrible states of disrepair. The unrest following The Confluence led to the dissolution of hoyrall society, and the sites of worship to the god that once bound them all together were quickly targeted by dissenters and never-do-wells. New churches to Zagnexis are well-appointed and carefully kept, tiled with the carapace of insects in exquisite mosaics that depict the journey of the hoyrall.</p>\n<h2>Holy Text</h2>\n<p>There is no written or oral tradition to the worship of Zagnexis; lesser followers are taught the rites of worship through nonverbal communication (through limbs or antennae), and acolytes meld their minds with greater priests in ritual-driven meldings of the minds. Only this devout form of communication is fit for the transmission of the holiest information known to the worshippers of the insect god.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n</div>","markdown":""},"_id":"BgaAYMVXk3L6daU4","image":{},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"sort":2200000,"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"JournalEntry.1nhWSRlTjP4u99gB.JournalEntryPage.vHtchpvGcDlwG7Ja"}}},{"sort":2150000,"name":"Xio","type":"text","_id":"o7Bl7XnxenERvjAq","title":{"show":false,"level":1},"image":{},"text":{"format":1,"content":"<div class=\"aventyr\"><p class=\"s5\">Xio</p><p><strong>Titles:</strong> The Eternal Combatant, Captain of Captains, The Blood Rage</p><p><strong>Home:</strong> Valhalla</p><p><strong>Symbol:</strong> A star crafted from five crossed swords surrounding a bleached skull</p><p><strong>Alignment:</strong> NE</p><p><strong>Portfolio:</strong> Bravery, Combat, War</p><p><strong>Domains:</strong> Destruction, Ferocity, Honor, Strength, War</p><p><strong>Favored Weapon:</strong> Warhammer and handaxe</p><p>Xio is the deity of battle, both honorable and otherwise; he goes wherever there is war or brings it to lands where it is not, ensuring constant and glorious battle.</p><h2>History</h2><p>None truly know when Xio came into existence, but it is said that as long as there has been conflict, he has been amongst those who fight.

Anyone whose business is war is almost unwillingly bound to the Captain of Captains, and his blessing is known to turn the tide of battle on numerous occasions. His clergy are most often those who begin war, or followers that find peace where it exists and start a violent conflict. Most lands find these warmongers to be no better than bandits (worse than most) resulting in an almost world-spanning bounty for Xio’s clergy—a fact which they relish, meeting each new bounty-hunter with zeal and their god’s greatest blessings.</p><h2>Holy Text</h2><p><em>The Business of War</em><br />Though there are strategic insights to be gleaned from these heavy tomes, the business of war is largely about relishing the glory of battle more than how to conduct it.</p><p> </p></div>","markdown":""},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{"core":{"sheetClass":""}}},{"sort":1250000,"name":"The Mother Spirit","type":"text","_id":"7JZLaCukpLMqn2R2","title":{"show":true,"level":1},"image":{},"text":{"format":1,"content":"<div class=\"aventyr\"><p class=\"s5\">The Mother Spirit</p><p><strong>Titles:</strong> The Great Mother, Leaf Gatherer, Four Heart</p><p><strong>Home:</strong> A nexus of the elemental planes of Air, Earth, Fire and Water</p><p><strong>Alignment:</strong> Neutral Good</p><p><strong>Portfolio:</strong> nature, creation, family</p><p><strong>Worshippers:</strong> @UUID[JournalEntry.QlctNkzE9injOde9.JournalEntryPage.myrc4omqUaiD3RKZ]{Halfling}and fey of @UUID[JournalEntry.PCe82J4UbHQWFYYL]{Picollo}, and those who believe in the Four Winds theory of creation.</p><p><strong>Domains:</strong> Air, Community, Earth, Fire and Water</p><p><strong>Subdomains:</strong> Family, Metal, Wind, Oceans</p><p><strong>Favored Weapon:</strong> Unarmed strike</p><h2>History</h2><p>Worshipers of the Mother Spirit believe that when the elements came together to form the world, a vessel was required to prevent disastrous interaction between opposed elements. The Mother Spirit gathered the elements into her four-chambered heart to allow them to work in community to craft the world.</p><h2>Appearance</h2><p>The Mother Spirit most often appears as a halfling woman with fey or otherworldy features. She wears a homespun brown robe woven with simple leaf patterns. Her hair is that of autumn leaves, tinged with flame. The presence of the other three elements can be found in her ever present tears of alternating joy and sadness, the comforting breath of her voice, and the adamantine sheen of her forearms and hands.</p><h2>Church of The Great Mother</h2><p>Although worshipped primarily in @UUID[JournalEntry.PCe82J4UbHQWFYYL]{Picollo}, knowledge of the Great Mother has been brought to other areas of Aventyr by halflings displaced by the Great Schism, or fey wandering throughout the lands as their whimsy takes them.</p><h2>Worshippers and Clergy</h2><p>Priests usually dress in homespun robes and go about unarmed. Clerics of the Great Mother must select the community domain (or family subdomain) as one of their domains, but may select any of the elemental domains or subdomains as their second. The prestige class, devotee of the Four Hearts, grants access to additional elemental domains.</p><p>Clerics with the separatist archetype can often be found. The Great Mother recognizes that there are many paths to community, and loves these “Fallen Leaves” as much as any other worshipper, hoping they will one day embrace community as a tenet of faith.</p><h3>Fallen Leaf cleric</h3><p>Fallen Leaves are clerics of the Mother Spirit Mastering the divine nature of dual elements requires further study, available only to the Devotee of the Four Hearts.</p><h3>Devotee of the Four Hearts</h3><p>Devotees of the Four Hearts are worshipers of the Mother Spirit who seek to understand more fully the act of creation initiated by the joining of all four of the elements through a deeper examination of the elements themselves. As their understanding increases, they add additional domains to their repertoire of gifts from the goddess.</p><p><strong>Role:</strong> A Devotee of the Four Hearts is more prepared to deal with elemental challenges than her less erudite brothers and sisters. Because the theological study of the elements is deeply intertwined with the nature of the goddess, the scaling of the holy abilities of these priests are less impacted with a diversion into a prestige class.</p><p><strong>Alignment:</strong> Most members of this prestige class tend to be neutral or neutral good to better understand the balance required in bringing together the elements. Lawful clerics embrace the discipline of safeguarding the elements and the world around them while those elements join in community, whereas chaotic priests embrace the messiness of creation.</p><h2>Holy Text: The Tree of Community</h2><p>Temples to the goddess are centered around a great tree which forms the center of the complex, regardless of its architectural style (or design of the grove in cases of a fey temple). The leaves of the tree contain the holy writings of the Mother, as well as the stories of her worshippers, unnumbered as the leaves themselves. Divination and prophetic magic is often tied to, or enhanced by, the tree of community; to read one’s leaf is to gain insight to one’s soul.</p><p></p><p></p></div>","markdown":""},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}},{"sort":1950000,"name":"Qathindli","type":"text","_id":"jjNtg5QMfe2uI6uS","title":{"show":false,"level":1},"image":{},"text":{"format":1,"content":"<div class=\"aventyr\"><p class=\"s5\">Qathindli</p><p><strong>Titles:</strong> The Monkey Primeval, The Unsullied</p><p><strong>Home:</strong> @UUID[JournalEntry.dHHrcptCELfN05gb.JournalEntryPage.eOVkEXkbiSWbkVcp#treeland]{Treeland}</p><p><strong>Alignment:</strong> Chaotic Neutral</p><p><strong>Symbol:</strong> A monkey face with a painted boomerang for a smiling mouth (only used by humans)</p><p><strong>Portfolio:</strong> Nature, Primates, Wilderness</p><p><strong>Worshippers:</strong> Monkeys and disparate or relocated people from the @UUID[JournalEntry.g4odaMsHbRkeNFhn]{Vast Swamp} or the @UUID[JournalEntry.dHHrcptCELfN05gb]{Yerek Steppes}</p><p><strong>Domains:</strong> Animal, Chaos, Plant, Protection</p><p><strong>Favored Weapon:</strong> Boomerang</p><p></p><p>Two hundred years ago, Mentane Flamebearer, a human cleric of a best-forgotten god, and Golar, his half-orc monk bodyguard landed on the eastern shore of what would become @UUID[JournalEntry.dHHrcptCELfN05gb.JournalEntryPage.eOVkEXkbiSWbkVcp#treeland]{Treeland}. The reason for the visit was that Mentane thought he had found a way to become a god. His hypothesis was that if he could instill the magical essences that he acquired daily into the same place for a long period of time, then the release of that pent up energy into himself would push him past the boundary of mortality and into the realm of godhood. Mentane chose a small fuzzy fruit with a green interior, called a forhoral, which grew on a vine as his receptacle of power.</p><p>As they settled on the eastern edge of the forest Golar began to notice the large numbers of primates in the forest. Ignoring them, Mentane had Golar find a piece of wood to allow the vines of the fruit grow upward.</p><p>For the next year, every morning, Mentane would slowly and carefully direct his magical energies into the seed that he had planted. Golar, not being needed, wandered the forest. Some of the primates took interest in the two for a while, but seeing that they were no immediate threat, they were content to ignore the two.</p><p>After about a month, one small chimpanzee began following the Golar as he explored what would become known as Treeland. He began to call her “Qathindli,” which translated roughly to “small one” in his local Orcish dialect. He would call and wave to her every morning and she would chatter back at him.</p><p>Something surprising that Golar noticed was that Qathindli would watch him when he went through his morning exercises. She would sit on a branch and stare at him while he moved in slow, deliberate patterns. She had taken a special liking to his three-bladed boomerang. When she wasn’t watching him practice, he would almost always find her at his pack, holding the throwing weapon. Eventually, he carved her her own two-bladed boomerang and placed a leather strap around the two ends. She took it with her everywhere.</p><p>As the year progressed, Mentane’s fruit began to grow, becoming larger than usual for this type of fruit. The vine grew quickly up the post and one year to the day of its planting, Mentane emerged from his tent, ready to become a god.</p><p>His forhoral fruit was gone. In its place, he found Qathindli sitting on the forest floor, holding the remains of the forhoral fruit.</p><p>She sat and stared, her monkey mind not comprehending what was happening to her.</p><p>Mentane began ranting and raving about the amount of effort he put into the project and his loss to a monkey. In his rage, he was preparing to utterly destroy Qathindli when she turned her head toward him and shocked both he and Golar.</p><p>“What is happening to me?” she asked loudly and haltingly.</p><p>All three stared at each other for a moment before Qathindli screeched and ran off into the forest.</p><p>A few days later, Mentane packed up his belongings and stowed them on the boat. He was going to make his way back to the @UUID[JournalEntry.QVrlu0lTv2vFtT5P]{Klavek Kingdom}. Golar said that he was going to stay in the forest for the time being. They bade each other farewell and Golar watched Mentane sail off into the sunrise.</p><p>Golar found Qathindli her near her tribe of monkeys. She was speaking quickly and erratically, words from every language spilling out of her mouth. Golar understood words from a few languages and recognized several more. The other monkeys were frightened of her.</p><p>Using food, Golar tempted Qathindli out of her tree and through a long and arduous process, explained what Mentane had done with the forhoral fruit and that his best guess was that when she had eaten the fruit, she had absorbed all of the magical power invested in it and that she had become more than a monkey.</p><p>Over the course of the next six months, Golar taught Qathindli control thanks to his martial training. While she did learn how to focus her newly found thoughts, she was still a monkey inside. Her train of thought often derailed into a conglomeration of words from different languages, which made it difficult for Golar to understand.</p><p>The change in her standing among the primates came when, as she and Golar were training in a small clearing, a wild boar broke through the undergrowth and charged at Golar. Though the battle was brief, it was also incredibly violent. In the end, the boar lay dead and Golar had numerous cuts and slashes from the boar’s wicked tusks. Qathindli rushed out from her hiding place and chattered at Golar in numerous languages as he started to succumb to his injuries. As he tumbled to the ground, Qathindli placed her hands on him and with a visible light, poured healing energy into Golar.</p><p>The forest around the two of them went silent as the watchful monkeys around them looked on and saw the power that Qathindli now possessed.</p><p>While she may not have been a demigoddess in the classical sense, Qathindli has eclipsed monkeyhood and is something more. She had decided to be the protector of Treeland, which she named herself. When she accepted that mantle, she became a demigoddess.</p><h2>Appearance</h2><p>Qathindli can change her appearance to that of any primate in existence, except human. Her preferred form is a pygmy monkey that stands roughly six inches tall, with bright red hair. This form seems to cause less violent reactions in those that she speaks with than one of her larger shapes.</p><p>Each of her forms has a face that is like the race she is interacting with than it is monkey-like.</p><h2>Church</h2><p>Even though she doesn’t understand it, the humans that live in @UUID[JournalEntry.dHHrcptCELfN05gb.JournalEntryPage.eOVkEXkbiSWbkVcp#treeland]{Treeland} worship Qathindli. The services are held outside usually around midday, but it varies due to the weather.</p><p>The leader of the humans, Damon, teaches that the people of his tribe should live like the monkeys: in harmony with nature. Because of his worship, Qathindli grants him spells, even if she doesn’t know how she does that.</p><h2>Worshippers &amp; Clergy</h2><p>Qathindi’s worshippers are all of the humans that live in Treeland, under the guidance of her only clergy member, @UUID[JournalEntry.dHHrcptCELfN05gb.JournalEntryPage.Tc1kTiX3bvQt4Jd7#damon]{Damon}. One of the titles Damon has given Qathindli is “The Unsullied.” He believes that she is holy because she has never been human, and therefore is above us and unsullied by her nature.</p><h2>Holy Text</h2><p>Qathindli has no holy text to speak of. As her knowledge of language grows, she has had Golar and Damon try to teach her how to write. The two main problems are that monkey hands are not designed for holding human writing utensils and Qathindli still has the mind of a monkey, so any given sentence contains multiple languages and bad translations, making them impossible to read. Damon still collects these “writings” and keeps them safe.</p></div>","markdown":""},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}}],"_stats":{"systemId":"dnd5e","systemVersion":"2.1.2","coreVersion":"10.291","createdTime":1662054505131,"modifiedTime":1674301334112,"lastModifiedBy":"EsIYTtNnjwxUbKOG"},"ownership":{"default":0,"R5IsvMTH5P79pBoG":3},"folder":"j9cXBagzZ1ARsO2I","sort":1000000},{"name":"Races of Aventyr","pages":[{"name":"Elves","type":"text","title":{"show":false,"level":2},"text":{"format":1,"content":"<div class=\"aventyr\">\n<p class=\"s5\">Elves</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<img style=\"margin:0px 15px 15px 0px;border:0px;float:right\" src=\"modules/aaw-games-aventyr/Races-Images/Elf-of-Silent-Forest.webp\" width=\"255\" height=\"363\" />\n<p><em>Elves in human lands are generally considered spies, and looked upon with great suspicion.

A hero may be the exception to the rule, but will never let other races know the secrets of their homeland. Elves live for thousands of years and have an inner-wisdom of the natural world that humans will never attain. They are aloof and secretive and generally keep to themselves. The majority of elves live within the protective confines of the @UUID[JournalEntry.wVQiwLZtRuaqbpFA]{Silent Forest} to the south of the @UUID[JournalEntry.QVrlu0lTv2vFtT5P]{Klavek Kingdom}. The Silent Forest is a magical place where humans are forbidden, and those who have ventured into the forest never return. An elf cannot willingly give up the secrets of her homeland even if tortured, magically manipulated, or even psionically attacked. Most elves choose either the path of magic or nature and given the seemingly endless life they are gifted, excel marvellously in either.</p>\n<h2>The Vast Swamp</h2>\n<p>Magic is used by the Black Gold Consortium to speed up extraction and enhance the efficiency of its workers, tasks excelled at by elven mages and alchemists—it spends a hefty sum to these scholars if they can provide results. Elves reluctantly take the money for their services but their true reasons for inhabiting the area remain hidden from the Black Gold Consortium. The elves’ love of nature is always paramount and the reason why they are truly working with them is to see that the business does not damage the ecosystem of the swamp. Magic means of extraction are cleaner and less damaging to the area, and there are whispers of a secret order of elven saboteurs who work towards stopping any forms of extraction that the elves do not approve of.

Large portions of their island home of @UUID[JournalEntry.PCe82J4UbHQWFYYL]{Picollo} far to the southeast remain uninhabited. Enclaves of exiles across the breadth and width of Aventyr have exposed many nations and races to the existence of halflings, but many isolated folks often perceive them as children or humans of stunted growth.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Halflings bear scant trust for the other races of Aventyr, especially humans, whom they view as feckless and faithless. Halflings from exiled backgrounds are more likely to be trusting of non-halflings and tend to hold more true to the ancient ways and happy-go-lucky traditions of halfling society. Those whose families suffered during the @UUID[.SGw7zGFtvjLNPDMY]{Hoyrall} Wars and enslavement are more prone to pragmatism. This practical outlook has begun to erode the traditional paths of fellowship and community. Though fragile, a bond does still remain between all halflings; it is taboo for one halfling to kill another even under dire circumstances; those that do face banishment. When banding together in groups halflings are a force to be reckoned with.</p>\n<h2>Vast Swamp</h2>\n<p>Halflings are often called upon when the Black Gold Consortium needs something done in a tight spot. Small folk can often find employment cleaning or fixing in-between the cogs of extraction centers, or removing blockages in tall chimneys or long pipes; the work is always dangerous, so they expect to be paid well. The Neliton family is one of the core families in the consortium and in charge of halfling relations in @UUID[JournalEntry.g4odaMsHbRkeNFhn.JournalEntryPage.Tdkqx23iD22AVlLv]{Cherrian’s Rest}. The family’s easy going nature has protected them from the internal conflicts of the consortium—they love to show off their strong sense of fashion. The Nelitons are the trendsetting family of the Consortium, often wearing the finest garments and jewels just to show off their lavishness and to invoke the jealousy of the other families.</p>\n<h2>Subtypes</h2>\n<h3>Seaborn</h3>\n<p>Most of the of the archipelago that made up greater @UUID[JournalEntry.PCe82J4UbHQWFYYL]{Picollo}was buried under the sea when the Dracoprime fell in the Great Schism, but scattered isles remain. Some halflings spend their whole lives on ships traveling between these isles, mainland Picollo, and the rest of Aventyr. While they feel bonds of kinship to all halflings, their ties to their shipmates are the closest. Years of fighting wind and wave have taught them caution, and that discretion is often the better part of valor.</p>\n<h3>Highlanders</h3>\n<p>On the @UUID[JournalEntry.PCe82J4UbHQWFYYL.JournalEntryPage.Gv1vyttllOYQaK2t#the-great-mountain]{The Great Mountain}, the highland halflings were in the thickest fighting during the @UUID[.SGw7zGFtvjLNPDMY]{Hoyrall} Wars as the insect-like race spewed forth from the tunnels and chambers riddling the great peak. Alliances with the @UUID[.RTYoyteEKY7EOhy2]{dweorg} at the base of the mountain and the @UUID[.MsDyrandNiqdPIrd]{zwerc} its top provided arms and armor and magic during the struggle, and often a place of retreat.</p>\n<h3>Tree-Borers</h3>\n<p>These halfling clans live alongside the fey in @UUID[JournalEntry.PCe82J4UbHQWFYYL.JournalEntryPage.Gv1vyttllOYQaK2t#the-great-forest]{the great forest of Picollo}. They make their homes in living trees, hollowed out with a combination of plant husbandry and fey magic. Endless pranks and tricks played on the halflings by their fey neighbors often have them cursing their luck. The tree-borers took in many refugees during the @UUID[.SGw7zGFtvjLNPDMY]{Hoyrall} Wars, and the final resistance was mounted from within the forest itself.

The Vikmordere had been using @UUID[JournalEntry.ismpCNWpGHvB1iPw]{Rybalka}, a village of tribal fishermen and woodworkers as a base of operations for their attacks on the three Riverside Klavekian villages. The village of Rybalka also works a local iron mine which supplied ore for the Vikmordere weapons and shipbuilding tools.</p>\n<p>  The Klavek Kingdom Monarchy moved troops into the Vikmordere Valley and launched an arduous assault against the Vikmordere in hopes of securing this strategic location and obtaining the lucrative iron mine. After many failed attempts and the death of hundreds of Klavekian ground troops, the Klavek Kingdom was finally able to oust the Vikmordere raiders and take over the small village and local mine. In order to hold the location, additional troops were brought in to clear the mountainside forests of the rest of the Vikmordere warriors which resulted in horrible casualties for the Klavekians. Eventually, almost every Vikmordere in a 15-mile radius was slaughtered. A few Vikmordere survived by hiding in abandoned ruins and mountain caves, which were passed up by the Klavek Kingdom soldiers seeing as it was impossible to follow every possible lead in such a large territory.</p>\n<p>The majority of the Vikmordere people still thrive in the mountains and in the deep recesses of the winding Serpent Lake, waiting for the day when a great Vikmordere champion rises up to lead them to victory and reclamation of their ancestor’s land and the village now called “Rybalka” by the filthy Klavs.</p>\n</div>","markdown":""},"_id":"sPIEyCZy4k35amgs","image":{},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"sort":900000,"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"JournalEntry.aQr9obWamQcmAPUN.JournalEntryPage.wRMpAyePvqRtSHn0"}}},{"name":"Human (Klavekian)","type":"text","title":{"show":false,"level":2},"text":{"format":1,"content":"<div class=\"aventyr\">\n<p class=\"s5\">Human (Klavekian)</p>\n<img style=\"float:left;margin:0px 15px 15px 0px;border:0px\" src=\"modules/aaw-games-aventyr/Races-Images/Klavekian-Human-Male.webp\" width=\"282\" height=\"365\" />\n<p><em> </em></p>\n<p>Klavekians are a hearty steadfast people who have been dealt with impossible odds and found ways to cope.

Over thousands of years, the weak have died out while the strong have prospered, leaving a people able to withstand cold temperatures and sometimes go for days at a time without food or water. Although wilderness travel is rarer for those living in big cities, all Klavekians at one time or another must make overland journeys at which point they experience what it truly means to be Klavekian. The Klavek Kingdom retains a massive military presence which dominates the known world.

The following is the story the dwarves tell when asked how they were brought into being.</p>\n<h2>Forging of the Dverger</h2>\n<p>In the days of darkness when the world was young, the gods forged a race from the very heart of the world itself.</p>\n<p>They called this race “Dvergr” and placed them close to the heart of Motherworld.</p>\n<p>The Dvergr thrived and prospered, but as time went on they became greedy, fighting over the precious metals and gems of the Motherworld.</p>\n<p>   The gods foresaw the destruction of the Dvergr at their own hands, thus they divided the race into five parts, each sharing the appearance of the first Dvergr (but only a fragment of its whole)</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>The first </strong>were named @UUID[.RTYoyteEKY7EOhy2]{Dweorg}, and were created from the Dvergr’s hands and heart giving them honor and expert craftsmanship.</p>\n<p><strong>The second</strong> were made from the @UUID[.eMZGcsX17wpAg4DE]{Dvergr’s head} and kept its most proud of names. They stayed deep beneath the world toiling in their greatest cities, only an echo of their former selves.</p>\n<p><strong>The third </strong>were named the @UUID[.MsDyrandNiqdPIrd]{Zwerc}, created from the spirits of the Dvergr. This granted them innate power over magic, their mystical nature making them loners and travelers with an endless thirst for knowledge.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The potent avarice of the Dvergr, however, would not be undone by the gods—traveling far from the deific crafting, the very essence of their greed delved deep into Aventyr, much deeper than the gods had permitted the Dvergr to go. Soon they had discovered HEL—where devils and demons dwell—and while the first three races were created, a pact was forged with the denizens there. The devils granted the Dvergr’s avarice physical form and realms in the deepest, most foul and flaming depths of the Underworld—but they did not stop there. The devils gave the @UUID[.Atn2VIF5a1D1uJUZ]{Gitwerc} the ability to siphon souls from the other races to feed themselves, and in turn they granted the Gitwerc more power.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>When the gods returned to forge the fourth, they found the Dvergr’s entrails snatched up by devils who had turned them into a terrible creature, the Gitwerc.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The gods, realizing their mistake in creating a race with no evil intent, vowed never to do so again and went to work creating the fifth race in secret, using all the remaining parts of the Dvergr. The fifth and final race would be eloquent, honorable, knowledgeable, and nearly immortal, yet the race would be forever divided, torn between light and darkness. Their souls were permanently bound to the world, sentenced with a nearly endless life staring out upon the sea of eternity, never able to attain that balance which comes so easy to the other races. The gods placed this race above and below the world, both in light and in darkness; they became the @UUID[.ei36LjIhEoh87vgE]{Elves} and the @UUID[.8HyVcZ70eyhwNJsu]{Drow}.</p>\n<p>     Then the gods did something which surprised all of the races. They created a realm between Upperworld and the Underworld, using the culminating thoughts of all the new races to forge the “Gift from the Gods”, the first humans: Askr and Embla.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>This gift would bring balance to the world.</strong></p>\n</div>","markdown":""},"_id":"t4LZuyNruvzneOHD","image":{},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"sort":1900000,"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"JournalEntry.Q6HzSBK0eklvkhs2.JournalEntryPage.p9zpIU4TMugYgXJS"}}},{"name":"Dweorg","type":"text","title":{"show":false,"level":3},"text":{"format":1,"content":"<div class=\"aventyr\">\n<p class=\"s5\">Dweorg</p>\n<img style=\"float:left;margin:0px 15px 15px 0px;border:0px\" src=\"modules/aaw-games-aventyr/Races-Images/Dweorg-171x300.webp\" width=\"171\" height=\"300\" />\n<p><em> </em></p>\n<p>Dweorg are the most common @UUID[.t4LZuyNruvzneOHD]{Dwarven} subtype, denizens of the Underworld that enjoy mining and blacksmithing.

The city has tended to have a fractious relationship with Mohkba because, due to the close proximity to the more hostile regions of Klavek territory, it has often found itself as a center of guerrilla activity from @UUID[JournalEntry.QlctNkzE9injOde9.JournalEntryPage.t4LZuyNruvzneOHD]{dwarf}, @UUID[JournalEntry.QlctNkzE9injOde9.JournalEntryPage.lMtTJxWecu1ISdP0]{gnome}, @UUID[JournalEntry.QlctNkzE9injOde9.JournalEntryPage.myrc4omqUaiD3RKZ]{halfling}, and other humanoid communities, all of which have traditionally used the natural resources for themselves. Mohkba’s – and therefore what is considered Tolkovar’s – the response has always been seen as slow at best and as completely ignoring the town at worst. This has led to the citizens of Morsain occasionally holding back wood, ore and taxes from the king, just to make a point.</p>\n<p><em>Read more about Morsain and enjoy a fully fleshed-out city (nearly every location detailed!) in the mega-adventure </em><a href=\"https://adventureaweek.com/shop/pathfinder/snow-white-products/snow-white/\"><em>Snow White</em></a><em>.</em></p>\n</div>","markdown":""},"_id":"ulLkhApELbg08M4o","image":{},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"sort":-150000,"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{"core":{"sheetClass":""}}},{"name":"Mohkba","type":"text","_id":"dwAJ5Jtc6ii8zQoh","title":{"show":false,"level":1},"image":{},"text":{"format":1,"content":"<div class=\"aventyr\">\n<p class=\"s5\">Mohkba</p>\n<img style=\"display:block;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto\" src=\"modules/aaw-games-aventyr/Setting-images/City-of-Mohkba-Large-750x1007.webp\" width=\"261\" height=\"475\" />\n<p> </p>\n<h2>The founding years</h2>\n<p>Sages start the history of Mohkba and thereby @UUID[.ulLkhApELbg08M4o]{Klavek} with the Years of the Angry Sea when the titanic Kraken ravaged the coasts of what today is eastern Klavek. The early @UUID[JournalEntry.QlctNkzE9injOde9.JournalEntryPage.DXD1ygEckY0JIUFB]{Klavekians} had spread from the borders of the elven woods toward the sea and built the first realms there before that time. But since almost everything built near the sea had been destroyed by the beast, the great evacuation that followed started a new age.</p>\n<img style=\"display:block;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto\" src=\"modules/aaw-games-aventyr/Setting-images/octopus-clip-art-2-640x413.jpg\" width=\"477\" height=\"354\" />\n<p>Immunity from attack, so rare in those days, caused the eastward movement of human colonization to become reversed. That is to say, settlers began to flow back from the old-established but now ravaged colonies of the Eastern Sea to the unoccupied lands near the Serpent Tail river. This constituted the first condition which, arising out of the geographical position of Mohkba, contributed to the successful settlement of the Mohkba region. Another condition which contributed to the growth of the Principality was the fact that Mohkba stood upon a river which had always – even from the most ancient times – been possessed of great commercial importance, a waterway connecting Central Klavek with the @UUID[JournalEntry.ismpCNWpGHvB1iPw.JournalEntryPage.Erya8w29cRTTJELu]{Serpent Lake} and its untouched resources. Of course these lucky years were way before the @UUID[JournalEntry.QlctNkzE9injOde9.JournalEntryPage.I4CpK8rTs0HgD7hW]{Vikmordere} discovered there was something worth raiding on the Serpent Tail river. The third factor was that said river was not connected to the eastern ocean and thus safe from the kraken.</p>\n<img style=\"display:block;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto\" src=\"modules/aaw-games-aventyr/Setting-images/Settlement-of-Mohkba-640x480.jpg\" width=\"449\" height=\"387\" />\n<p>Yuri Dvagaslov thus made Mohkba the point where two great popular movements intersected one another – namely, a movement of colonization northeastwards along the Serpent Tail river and a movement of commerce back southeastwards toward the sea once the kraken was sleeping again. The city’s geographical position conferred great economic advantages upon the early Princes of Klavek. A large population attracted to their appanage meant a large number of direct taxpayers, while the movement of a large volume of commercial traffic on the Serpent Tail river before the Vikmordere Wars meant a stimulation of popular industry in his dominions and a large flow of transit-dues into his treasury.</p>\n<p>The physical network of rivers leading toward the lake is first of all a transportation network. The early klavekians traveled the rivers and lake by boats in summer and with sleds over the ice in winter. But the river network supported social interaction. Trading of amber, honey and furs produced economic networks. Marriage alliances and divine exchanges both produced and strengthened social networks. And the frequent interaction permitted the klavekian language to spread and become so dominant over a wide area that it is now known simply as ‘common’.</p>\n<h2>Mohkba today</h2>\n<p>Mohkba has lots of quiet cozy lanes, wooden houses, an incredible number of monasteries and churches, and delicious pickles are on sale on every corner. The capital of Klavek is known for its great towers, most belonging to churches, but others to the nobility or to wizards. When alliances are forged due to marriages, illusions of bridges adorned with shared banners connect the towers, creating an ever changing scenery. Mohkba is composed out of eight quarters. Nobility and commoners share all Quarters, except for the vast @UUID[.LGCNFtJ4cWlq0HjE#gardeners-quarter]{Gardener’s quarter} where but a handful of druids live, the @UUID[.LGCNFtJ4cWlq0HjE#arcane-quarter]{Fortress of Arcane Arts }which is reserved for Magicians and Alchemists and assumed to be a dangerous place anyhow, and the small @UUID[.LGCNFtJ4cWlq0HjE#kings-fortress]{King’s quarter} where only royalty has their homes. The social distinction is made by height, not place, in Mohkba, so even in downtrodden @UUID[.LGCNFtJ4cWlq0HjE#mariners-quarter]{Mariner’s quarter} and reclusive @UUID[.LGCNFtJ4cWlq0HjE#zveni-island]{Zveni island} is nobility to be found.</p>\n</div>","markdown":""},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"sort":650000,"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{"core":{"sheetClass":""}}},{"name":"City Quarters","type":"text","_id":"LGCNFtJ4cWlq0HjE","title":{"show":false,"level":2},"image":{},"text":{"format":1,"content":"<div class=\"aventyr\">\n<p class=\"s5\">City Quarters</p>\n<h2>Divine Quarter</h2>\n<p>Visitors are fascinated by the cathedral of the Sophianeum, the Holy Wisdom of the Gods – the oldest surviving Klavekian stone monument. It was built so long ago that there are no written evidences, which had led to speculations about it being placed there by the gods themselves. Be this as it may, the powerful monolithic massive structure of the monument still dominates not only the divine quarter, but the whole historic center of @UUID[.dwAJ5Jtc6ii8zQoh]{Mohkba}. The basis of its complex three-dimensional architecture is a four-domed, five-columned brick temple of the cross-and-cupola type with a high ground floor. It is built of brick and blue stone, and its blind arcades give it a special beauty and nobility. In the interior of this palladion a faithfuls attention is drawn by the unique historically formed iconostases icons. These are ancient mural paintings, national relics of Klavek that include the famous icon of Yuri Dvagaslov himself, the Holy Knight of the Crossroad. In the course of hundreds of years the Sophianeum was a center of the clerical, political and cultural life of ancient Mohkba.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<img style=\"float:right;margin:0px 15px 15px 0px;border:0px\" src=\"modules/aaw-games-aventyr/Setting-images/085-Cathedral-Tower-from-St-Johns-Street.jpg\" width=\"237\" height=\"316\" />\n<p>     Next to the Sophianeum is Alvarov’s Monastery that was founded by Prince Yaroslav the Witch as early as in the first century after the foundation of Mohkba, as a legend reads, and one cannot help being amazed by the striking beauty of another masterpiece of ancient Klavekian architecture. Many experts of Klavekian art justly believe Mohkba to be blessed by the Gods; no other old Klavekian cities have managed to preserve so many ancient architectural monuments adorned with wall murals. Visitors will see that with their own eyes visiting the churches of the Oreadean Gods on Vlassov Lake, appreciating at its true worth the old frescoes of world-famous Wulfgarin the Dwarf in the Church of the Enchantments on Vassili Street; singularly graceful murals in the Church of the Spirit of Bertramov on Prideful Field, admiring the beautiful clerical wall calendar of the Church of the Nameless Hero and studying wonderful mural compositions in The Sinless Cathedral. The later is also famous for its five-tier iconostasis with icons from up to four centuries ago.</p>\n<p>More mundane, but still very important are the Tower of the Inquisition and the Tower of the Order of the Elk, the latter the chivalric arm of the former and thus connected by a real bridge, one of the oldest non-illusionary bridges connecting Mohkba’s towers.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h3>Armour of Frozen Tears</h3>\n<p>When the @UUID[JournalEntry.QlctNkzE9injOde9.JournalEntryPage.I4CpK8rTs0HgD7hW]{Vikmordere} attacked @UUID[.dwAJ5Jtc6ii8zQoh]{Mohkba} in the old days, legend says that the face of Tsar Alexei VI was awash in tears of wrath, and that it was so cold during that attack that his tears freeze before hitting the ground. Those frozen tears were collected by a dwarven cleric and with the aid of an unknown smith forged into an armour of sparkling brilliance. Tsar Alexei himself wore the armour in the counterattack, when he charged the enemy at the front of his soldiers, and the vile Vikmordere magic dissipated into waterdrops while hitting the tsar, unable to harm him. While most of this tale seems to be a legend, the armour indeed does exist, and the tsars do wear it on the days of their coronation since the days of Tsar Gregory VI, twin brother and successor of Alexei. The armour is clearly magical, since it adjusts to the size of the monarch and even fitted Tsarina Anna’s very womanly body when her coronation came.</p>\n<p>The Armour of Frozen Tears is sky blue in colour, and in form unlike any other armour, though it somewhat resembles a flowing plate mail. The is no crest on the armour, nor any other sign, and, contradicting a then common legend, it can be worn by anyone, as was obvious after Mikhael the jester put it on during a festival. The armour also doesn’t prevent its wearer from being beheaded, which was also proven by said jester and the bodyguard of the enraged tsar. ‘To put on the frozen tears’ is now a common proverb for a daunting deed that went horribly wrong.</p>\n<p>The Armour of Frozen Tears is kept in the @UUID[.LGCNFtJ4cWlq0HjE#divine-quarter]{Sophianeum} and on display there, constantly guarded by a watch of honour.</p>\n<h3>The Tombstone of Bojar Pjotr</h3>\n<p>The Tombstone of Bojar Pjotr, build from marble and engraved with silver letters, describes the birth- and death-days of the Bojar Pjotr, who was known for his racial tolerance, and his bride, an unnamed Othyugh, who ate him at their wedding ceremony before being killed by the guests. Since that day the tombstone is used to promote racial purism, to be an outstanding example of foolish behaviour, to always come armed to a wedding and for lots of other more or less sensible things. But over the years the jokes gradually went sour, for even as Pjotr didn’t leave any relatives, the tombstone is always polished, and fresh flowers do appear next to it on the day of his birth, the day of both deaths and on a third day, which is supposed to be the birthing day of the proud bride. In later years a small fence was build around the tombstone, and now lovers faced with huge obstacles throw a flower inside the fenced area, where they lie fresh long after that should be possible, only to vanish without trace when another flower is thrown inside. It is known that the burden of the lovers is eased in some minor way as long as their flower is inside the fence, and that each pair of lovers may only throw one flower for this boon. Should there be no major obstacle to the love, or a second flower be thrown, then their flower withers away immediately, without replacing the last one, and bad luck is guaranteed for a month and a day. It also seems to matter what flower is chosen, a rose having other effects than a lily for instance, but that may be coincidence. Nonetheless there have been desperate lovers who went searching for a @UUID[JournalEntry.ismpCNWpGHvB1iPw.JournalEntryPage.w79VOo3UeUGraouv#winterflower]{Winterflower}, a rare wildflower supposed to grow in the northern mountains near the outpost of @UUID[JournalEntry.ismpCNWpGHvB1iPw]{Rybalka}, to better their chances for success.</p>\n<h3>Cold Iron Gate</h3>\n<p>The Cold Iron Gate is the impressive relict of a great effort to defeat the @UUID[JournalEntry.QlctNkzE9injOde9.JournalEntryPage.ei36LjIhEoh87vgE]{elves} and their fey allies once and for all. There is much disagreement about the details of the plan, but most sages agree that all walls and gates of @UUID[.dwAJ5Jtc6ii8zQoh]{Mohkba} were planned to be coated in cold iron. There are many different opinions about details though, if every town of the realm was to be coated in cold iron, and if the cold iron was meant to hold the fey outside or trap them inside instead. There is even a discussion if the elves themselves were hampered by cold iron in those ancient days, since they clearly aren’t in modern times. Whatever it is, after one gate was ready the whole plan was stopped due to lack of money. In modern days the Gate is infamous on the one hand, leading to the proverb of ‘he even has a cold iron toilet’ for someone with too much money, but oddly something of pride also, for it was a very ambitious project to say the least, and even unfinished its a symbol for Mohkba aiming very high. The Cold Iron Gate itself is somewhat barren, there are no gravels, signs or whatever in it, and has a dull blue colour that has appeared over time, since old texts describe the gate as being the colour of a grey stormcloud. Watchmen tell that the Cold Iron Gate is easier to close and to open then other gates of equal size. No invader has ever tried to break this gate down, so the ultimate test for the defensive attributes has not happened yet.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>Arcane Quarter</h2>\n<p> </p>\n<img style=\"float:right;margin:0px 15px 15px 0px;border:0px\" src=\"modules/aaw-games-aventyr/Setting-images/Wizard-with-Golem.webp\" width=\"252\" height=\"346\" />\n<p>The Arcane quarter is the only part of Mohkba without religious buildings. Not contend with lonely wizardly towers, the arcane wielders of Mohkba combined their resources to build the emerald fortress in the then Arcane suburb, now known as the somewhat infamous Fortress of the Arcane Arts. This fortress was mentioned in chronicles as early as five years after the foundation of the Sophianeum. The present walls and towers were constructed in a single night 200 years later. The central building of the emerald fortress is the four-domed college of Mutamateria, nicknamed ‘Transformation Cathedral’ to the chargrin of the clerics. The walls of the college are separated by pilasters with zakomari that were adorned with painting as far back as the 4th century after its foundation. The pinnacle of architecture when it was erected has a grandiose size and sensational shape, with eight cupolas, one for each school of magic, dazzling with luxury and an abundance of tiles, brick patterns and frescos. It is a real encyclopedia of arcane scenes which has no equivalent in Klavekian art. Today it is also connected with, or somewhat has overgrown, the Alchemists College, with is now part of the emerald fortress.</p>\n<h2>King’s Fortress</h2>\n<img style=\"float:right;margin:0px 15px 15px 0px;border:0px\" src=\"modules/aaw-games-aventyr/Setting-images/elizabethan-costumes-3.jpg\" width=\"270\" height=\"288\" />\n<p>The King’s Fortress was closely related to all the most important events in the life of ancient Mohkba: hosting foreign embassies, seeing-off warriors to fight the enemy, convening meetings of the Crown’s Advisors. Many centuries ago, the whole fortress was surrounded by ramparts, on which stood strong log walls and fortress towers. They served as reliable protection during the internecine wars of the Klavekian princes, but were later burned by Vikmordere invaders. Today, in a much safer age, nothing but a high wall remains.</p>\n<p>In addition to the above-mentioned Sophianeum, the King’s Fortress also features other striking monuments as the Faceted Palace – a rare specimen of elven architecture, built in the times of Vassily Elf-Friend jointly with elven masters, as well as the impressive and beautiful bellfry with a set of adamantit bells. In the central square of the King’s Fortress stands the monument “The Millenium of Klavek”, designed by Quincov the Stout and erected a bit prematurely 940 years after the foundation of Klavek by Tsar Alexei the Impatient. This unique document in bronze immortalizes all those who greatly contributed to the development of the country: its culture, science, art and literature, but also its tsars and war-heroes. The klavekian special political structure, spiritual freedom and territorial independence were highly favorable to the evolution of culture and art, and this is justly celebrated in the political heart of Klavek. Mohkba is one of the greatest art centers of the human world. Its architectural traditions, skaldic tales, school of icon-painting, jeweler’s and decorative applied art became famous all over the known world. Mohkba also is Klavekia’s major center of literacy and book production. As far back as the foundation years, by the will of the great Prince Yuri Dvagaslov himself, Mohkba saw the first school to train three hundred children at a time.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h3>The Emerald Casket</h3>\n<p>Once only known to a selected few trusted advisors of the Tsar, @UUID[.LGCNFtJ4cWlq0HjE#the-bridge-that-is-there-and-not-there]{ The Bridge That Is There And Not} There is supposed to be not the only legacy of Grigory Rivalnov. During the Time of Troubles a group of mercenaries took hold of the @UUID[.LGCNFtJ4cWlq0HjE#kings-fortress]{King’s Fortress} for a short time, and from these originated what is now a common legend. Deep under the King’s Fortress there’s an emerald casket, presumably holding the last of the Sinner Tsars in suspension, until a time where the lineage of Tsars is broken. There are some facts contradicting this tale, as the lineage of Tsars has been broken a few times in the past (most famously after the death of Tsarina Anna in 1143) and suspension doesn’t sound like illusionist magic, but still the legend persists. The Casket itself is rumored to be a huge emerald, hence the name, with a vague ageless male human shape enclosed in it. While nobody reliable has set her eyes on the casket in recent decades and talked about it, there are nonetheless many works of art depicting it in the city, even one monument in @UUID[.LGCNFtJ4cWlq0HjE#mariners-quarter]{Mariner’s Quarter}. Those works vary in many details from each other though, and there are ongoing and somewhat heated discussions which one looks more like the famous original.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>Trade-yard</h2>\n<p>On the opposite bank of the river, reachable by a footbridge, is Beatricov’s Court and the ancient Trade-yard, displaying many still-standing monuments of the early days of Klavek, all reminiscent of the busy trade life of Mohkba in the days before the Vikmordere Wars. Originally made of wood, it was almost completely destroyed by fire. Later new walls with defensive towers were erected. Not surprisingly, the symbol of the Trade-yard is a stone fortress, surrounded by an even more ancient earthen wall.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<img style=\"float:right;margin:0px 15px 15px 0px;border:0px\" src=\"modules/aaw-games-aventyr/Setting-images/237-The-Butcher-Newport-Market-Alley.jpg\" width=\"258\" height=\"233\" />\n<p>Nearly every house in the Trade-yard has a unique history and the central part of the quarter is one big architectural complex. The Beatricovan trading gallery is one of the biggest complexes in Klavekia. The layout is based on the plan of a typical merchant’s shop with trading on the ground floor and storage rooms in the attic and cellar. Rumors place the home of Klavek’s Thieves Guild here, but surely the Tsar’s Inquisitors would have ferreted this out long ago if there was any truth to the rumor.</p>\n<p>The most famous monument of the Trade-yard certainly is the Cube of Names for the most famous warrior-heroes of the first days of Mohkba, the greatest clerics, summoners, magi and oracles. The lower side on which the cube rests is supposed to show the names of rogues, the tsar’s under-hand, hidden even in the present. In the Trade-yard the ancient contracts are still stored, including such world-famous items as a great number of birch-bark scrolls and lead seals dating back to the founding years. These are indicative of a unique and striking level of literacy among ancient klavekians who were certainly and contrary to elven prejudices no barbarians at all and had a highly organized system of state control from the beginning.</p>\n<h3>The Hundred Candle Steps</h3>\n<p>When Yevgeni VI. married the elven lady Arianna Greenleaf in 692 his bride did make a grand entrance into @UUID[.dwAJ5Jtc6ii8zQoh]{Mohkba}. The last hundred steps of hers before she kissed the Tsar for the first time left footprints on the street, and immediatly after her delicate feet left the street a single cobblestone in each footprint went into tiny flames. Those flames still burn, a small but bright yellow light, unless @UUID[.ulLkhApELbg08M4o]{Klavek} is at war with the elves, when the flames change colour to blue.</p>\n<p>The flames may be extinguished easily, but they reflame on their own after a few minutes. They are unaffected by normal wind. The street were they are located is the street of the candlemakers and other trades who can use the handy open flames for their trade. It is one of the few tolerated displays of magic in the town since a rampaging troll could be stopped with help of these flames many years ago.</p>\n<h3>The Grand Scales</h3>\n<p>The @UUID[.LGCNFtJ4cWlq0HjE#trade-yard]{Trade-yard} has seen its share of good trades and bad trades, but also of frauds and con artists. Tsar Ironhand has had enough of that one day after his custom officers were cheated on a stormy night with a wooden block coated in gold and he commissioned the building of the Grand Scale, which is the height of a small building and able to weigh up to two tons of raw material. Its difficult and time consuming to handle, but very accurate and gives a +2 to appraise checks for raw materials. Rumours say that both the con artist and the custom officers are all part of the scale now, having been turned into the construction by magic or melted together with the iron from which is was built. In stormy nights they are rumoured to still wail for the tsars mercy.</p>\n<h2>Carpenter’s Quarter</h2>\n<p>Like every other separated part of Mohkba Carpenter’s Quarter has its own wall. The main gate connecting Carpenter’s quarter to the King’s Fortress has a famous décor on the outside, comprising three monumental tile compositions: To the right of the southern portal is a round bas-relief depicting Prince Yaroslav the Witch and under the arches of the side facades are two scenes of workers laboring. These unique ancient Klavekian tiles date back to first century after the foundation.</p>\n<p>The other way into this quarter is Nikolsky Gate. Behind it is the small “bridge of happiness,” hung with padlocks. At the edges of the bridge are two horseshoes of a centaur, one of which reads: “Eternal Love” in the language of the horsefolk. Holding hands, lovers go through the large horseshoe and walk on the eight small ones on the bridge. According to legend, a female centaur ambassador broke its horseshoe here on a stone, being dazzled by the sight of a Klavekian cavalry officer. To this day the “stone of desires” sits close to the bridge.</p>\n<p>Despite its name, Carpenter’s quarter has long been famous for its furriers and shoemakers. On the streets are a lot of wooden houses, stone mansion from the end of the century before last, as well as trading arcades new and preserved.</p>\n<p>Carpenter’s quarter is also known for its Abandoned Monastry, a building which stands empty for about 300 years now. Here False Yuri II (Grishka Raulyev) met the nun Tatyana, the widow of Alexei IV, Maria Poterowa, who had entered the monastery. She recognized the pretender as her son, Yuri. This was the trigger for the Troubles, an euphemistic name for one of the meanest of the Klavekian civil wars. Due to that sad part of Klavekian history the monastery is empty now, but still a fantastic sight. In the old days, in the minds of the people, the greatness of a monastery was always connected to the height of its belltower. The architectural center of the Carpenter’s Quarter is one of the highest belltowers in Klavekia, more than 89 meters high. Monumental and steadfast, it does not look overly heavy because of its many columns, wide arched openings and decoration, which contains Alexei’s monograms. The dome of the seven-storied belltower is decorated with the imperial crown – the monastry had always been under the special patronage of the tsars. On the orders of Metropolitan Vladimir, 8 bells were cast for it, including “The Bear”, the largest bell in Mohkba. Each has its own tone, but all together they allow the ringer to create a perfect harmonic composition, a gem of world cultural heritage, the Mohkba chimes. When the angels first heard it legend claimed they cried, creating the lake of Mohkba. Since the Troubles the bells are silent and refuse to ring, a sign that toppled the claim of false Yuri II more than anything else. Countless priests and magicians have tried to revive the chime since those days to no avail. Standing near “The Bear” they could only enjoy the stunning views of the river and the Bridge of Happiness across it.</p>\n<p>The boundless forests outside Mohkba behind the bridge are equally beautiful in summer as in winter, in morning as in evening. Mohkba and Mohkba region have long been intensely cultivated by man, perhaps more than any other region of Klavekia. Yet nature still occupies a huge part of it with clean lakes and rivers, and wild forests. It is hard to believe, but today forests still cover a huge part of Mohkba region, and with some luck one can still see wild animals looking from the belltower. One should take care though, the monastry is neglected and the stairs are somewhat unsafe.</p>\n<h3>The Bridge That Is There And Not There</h3>\n<p>Grigorij Rivalnov was the greatest Illusionist Mohkba has known in its long history, living in the days of the Sinner Tsars. It is told that once, at the 25th birthday of Tsar Anatol V., he changed the whole capital so that it looked like covered in molted gold, sparkling in the sunrise. Another story is not that beautiful, telling a tale where the Illusionist came to the Tsarina in the night disguised by foul magic to resemble the Tsar. Whether that tale is true or not, it was used against the Tsarevitch during the civil war after the death of Anatol V., claiming the young prince to be a wizard’s bastard. It was one of the many reasons why magic is so distrusted in Klavek up to the present time.</p>\n<p>Be the stories true or false, most of Rivalnov’s illusion have been banned or timed out over the long years since his death, save for the famous Bridge That Is There And Not There, or Rivalnov’s Bridge. It looks like a sturdy stone bridge, including small statues of famous citizens of Mohkba from the time where it was cast, most prominent among them the tsar and tsarina (but not the tsarevitch) in the middle of it. The bridge is famous enough that most people of Klavek know its an illusion, but nonetheless whoever attemps to cross it for the first time has to make a will save. If she fails, she is able to cross it for the rest of her life, even inside a carriage if every other passenger and the horses failed also. If she succeeds, she falls straight through the illusion and most likely takes a cold bath in the river. Most citizens of Mohkba are able to cross the bridge freely, having failed their save as children when they still believed in wonders.</p>\n<p>Of course its a common prank among teenagers to guide foreigners over the bridge, telling them about the illusion while doing so and laughing the moment the strangers take a bath.</p>\n<h3>The Unprotected Ruby</h3>\n<p>On a plaza in the midst of @UUID[.LGCNFtJ4cWlq0HjE#carpenters-quarter]{Carpenter’s Quarter} is an ebony pedestal with a flawless fist-sized red ruby on it. It is not protected by any means, and in fact has been stolen four times already, but always was returned in a week at most. It is obviously worth a fortune, should someone find a buyer for it, but doing that is the difficult part. Tied to the ruby is bad luck of the gravest sort, so most who did ever handle it for more than a few hours died horribly, and no one has managed to break that curse, if it is a curse at all. If the gem is returned to the pedestal all is well again, save for some scars, wounds or broken bones from the time of possessing the gem, but no unusual bad luck happens again. Sages have wondered about the properties of the Unprotected Ruby for long, and examined it – usually from afar – but no one knows its secret. Legend claims one tsar or another, the details vary, paid tribute to the @UUID[JournalEntry.QlctNkzE9injOde9.JournalEntryPage.I4CpK8rTs0HgD7hW]{Vikmordere} with this specially prepared gem, to weaken the enemy by cursing their leaders, but the gem had been returned after some time or never delivered at all after killing its maker in a weird accident which centered around a goose, a flower and a nail.</p>\n<h3>Watching Torches</h3>\n<p>In the Street of the Eye, where once the royal treasury was located, is one of the few magical features of Mohkba of the divine nature. Dating back to the years of Pjotr the Pius in ancient times the Grand Robbery of the treasury shook @UUID[.dwAJ5Jtc6ii8zQoh]{Mohkba} to the core. Pjotr did pray to the Guardian God for help against further occurences of this kind, and some claim that he could do not much else but pray after being poor like a goblin thanks to the thieves. Be this as it may, the street once leading to the treasury has magical torches to this day. They catch fire the moment an intelligent creature comes in 40 feet of them, and they sputter out with no one in the vicinity any longer. It was a very efficient warning system until the Second Great Robbery of the treasury which was committed with the help of golems. After the @UUID[JournalEntry.QlctNkzE9injOde9.JournalEntryPage.I4CpK8rTs0HgD7hW]{Vikmordere} plundered the treasury twice, each time illuminated by torchlight, it was relocated to a more secure location, and today wonderworkers, con artists and charlatans have their shops in the torchlit street, to the chargrin of many clerics. They sell everything, from splinters of the true bowl that graced the Empty Pedestal once, enough of them to build a glass dome over @UUID[.dwAJ5Jtc6ii8zQoh]{Mohkba} as the critics claim, to bones of the Sinner Tsars or the head of the Vikmordere chieftain Angus the Old from the days when he was still a child. Sometimes true magic can be found here, so its a place visited by many for its sense of wonder and promises.</p>\n<h3>The Floating Tower</h3>\n<p>When Klavek was young and mostly build of wood two rival families had a feud with each other that slowly escalated. One night the tower of one of the families was put to the torch by its rival, and the ground burned to ashes – but the ground only. The tower is still there to this day, the only wooden tower of this height in the town, but it has no first floor. Indeed it floats from the second floor up, but it stays in place no matter the wind. It was even inhabitat a while afterwards, but with the distrust in magic growing the family that owned it later moved away and now is rumoured to have left no inheritors. There have been some attempts in the past to remove or destroy the floating tower, but none did succeed so far. Today the floating tower is protected by the military, mostly to prevent hotheads from another attempt to burn it – along with the rest of the town while trying.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>Mariner’s quarter</h2>\n<p>Mariner’s quarter is the underbelly of @UUID[.dwAJ5Jtc6ii8zQoh]{Mohkba}, known for its cheap brothels and ramshackle pubs. But even in this bad place is a national icon to be found, the Navy Museum, a colorful painted wooden house. It exhibits the wooden boat, great-grandfather of Klavekia’s navy, that was sent out on the water of the Lake of Angelic Tears by the young Tsar Alexei III. Sadly that’s the only thing exhibited in the whole museum.</p>\n<p>According to legend, there was a stone idol standing in what is now the Mariner’s quarter that the ancient centaurs worshiped. The hermit Natalya prayed and received a magical staff from a divine elk with which she destroyed the idol, and then built a church on the site of the pagan shrine. Before going to fight the Vikmordere, Tsar Alexei the Twin made a pilgrimage to the monastery to take the staff of Natalya. After the battle of the Serpent, the tsar in gratitude built a cathedral where the church stood, one of the first multi-altar churches, which have additional altars dedicated to different gods. The interior of this cubic six-domed church is unusual: The arches are supported by five pillars, which gives the effect of volume. It could justifiably be called the pearl of that period of Klavekian architecture and its domes, walls, door frames and all other available surfaces are full of mural paintings. In modern days the cathedral is seldom visited, and but the altar of the gods dedicated to the sea and to long voyages is cleaned regularly. The staff of Natalya is rumored to have inspired Tarissov the Leprous in building the first @UUID[.1hMoSKS1OqlchIwq#the-blank-staffs]{Blank Staff}. This made his treason the more unbearable and added to the neglect of the Church of Natalya’s Staff.</p>\n<h3>The Empty Pedestal</h3>\n<p>In the Harbour area stands the famous Empty Pedestal, by itself a rather blank structure with no artistic value whatsoever, but in ancient time Leo II, The Tsar in the Bowl, had his crystal home on this pedestal overlooking the harbour and looking for outside help to break his curse. Its not clear who cursed him or why, and tales blame everyone from the Vikmordere, the clerics, the magicians to his own relatives for the vile deed. His grandson did break the bowl in 173, not wanting to be a mere regent as his father has been, thereby killing the tsar or what was left of him and provoking a short civil war known as the days of the Cleared Succession or the days of the Murdering Tsar by his enemies. The infamous victory speech by Tsar Leo IV was held standing on the very pedestal that held his grandfather for so many decades, and it was one of the longest and most winding speeches in the history of Mohkba, rumoured to have crashed the last resistance to his rule by boring all dissidents to death. Leo IV was known as the chattering tsar or the shattering tsar for many decades until Tsar Anatol VIII decided the matter almost 150 years later by naming Leo IV the Tsar who Broke the Bowl. Until today the people of Mohkba express their feelings toward the government by placing various fishes on the empty pedestal, each of them with a different meaning. Knowing which fish means what is a science in itself and a riddle to even many people of Mohkba, let alone foreign guests. Most governments see any fish in any position and any state of decay as an insult to them nowadays, which lets the pedestal been guarded most of the time and certainly when government is cutting public spending or raising taxes.</p>\n<h3>Dancing Skeleton</h3>\n<p>Once during the many wars with the Vikmordere a regiment of Klavekian archers managed to surprise a ritual by the Vikmordere. Suspecting a vile purpose of this ritual the archers peppered everyone attending in the grove, slaying everyone – almost. When the storm of arrows ceased, only the leading shaman was still on his feet and dancing, amidst a sea of dead. The next volley of arrows hit him exclusively, but, even being obviously dead, the dance continued. The Klavekian were scared, but took the shaman captive, without getting any response from him. Even bound he twitched in his dance moved with vacant, dead eyes. Back in Mohkba the shaman was showered with positive energy to no avail and ultimately thrown in a pool of acid, where his flesh receded, but his skeleton still danced. It was bound again and put away in a deep cell.</p>\n<p>An unknown number of decades later Tsar Alexei V., later called the ‘Mad Tsar’, decided to bolster morale of the citizens by putting the shaman on display. So the skeleton dances on a pedestal, at first closely watched by clerics and guards, but these days only by an honour guard of veterans of Klavekian skirmishes or battles with the Vikmordere. Oddly enough the few Vikmordere ambassadors that have visited Mohkba and seen the shaman have been reported to not be offended by the sight, but smiling knowingly, which unsettled more than one of the veterans guarding the Dancing Skeleton. But since the skeleton is dancing for more than 250 years by now and nothing visibly bad has come out of it yet, the citizens of Mohkba see the Dancing Skeleton as nothing more than a celebrated oddity, a trophy of war and a symbol of the weirdness of their Vikmordere neighbors.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h3>Spitting Statue</h3>\n<p>At the harbour of @UUID[.dwAJ5Jtc6ii8zQoh]{Mockba} is the statue of Dimitrij Denisonovitch, most honoured advisor to Tsar Pjotr the Diplomat and, for a very short time, of his successor Alexei the Twin. Denisonovitch is portrait as an especially ugly man, with an evil looking face, a long hook-like nose and a hunchback. It is well known that he featured none of this in his life, having been a rather handsome and charismatic man, but he counseled his Tsars toward accepting surrender and tribute to the Vikmordere, like Mohkba paid to the Saatman Empire before. His statue was erected to remember the people of the price of betrayal, for Denisonovitch was beheaded on the very first day of the reign of Alexei the Twin in 1096 for this craven council, and until this day passerby spit on the statue as their sign of national pride. There are rumours though that before 1096 there had been another statue of Denisonovitch, built by Pjotr the Diplomat for former successes of his councellor, showing the real self with a concerned face, and some people did cut themselves in front of this statue of Denisonovitch to let a drop of blood or two spill at his feet, for in the first battles of the Twin’s war theVikmordere claimed much blood of Mohkba and won most of them. Denisonovitchs council seemed wiser those days, but with the shifting tides of war and victory increasingly favouring Mohkba the old statue was toppled and later replaced by the new and ugly one, and today a different body fluid is offered to the advisor that failed from grace.</p>\n<h3>Statue of the Shamans</h3>\n<p>In the Vikmordere wars, Mohkba was frequently plundered, at least in parts, but at one time the Vikmordere tried to stay to conquer the town of their enemies once and for all. Chieftain Angus the Old died shortly after this decision, many claiming being struck down by the gods for his decision, and the Vikmordere went away to being splintered tribes as before. But a relic from those days is the statue of ice, vaguely build like a sea snake, was left behind by the Vikmordere. It still is in the @UUID[.LGCNFtJ4cWlq0HjE#mariners-quarter]{Mariner’s Quarter} as a warning from the Vikmordere threat, an oddity from times long past, and a part of the city defences. The serpent statue has a faint glimmer of conjuration magic. If touched and used as a focus component during the casting of summon swarm, summon monster or summon nature’s ally, and the spell is used to summon a serpent swarm or giant serpent, the spell lasts for an additional round, and, in the case of a summoned swarm, the swarm does not attack the caster, so long as he retains hold of the statue, allowing him to stand freely in the area of the swarm. The statue provides no such protection against serpent swarms conjured by others or encountered normally.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>Gardener’s quarter</h2>\n<p>On the Gardener’s quarter’s central square, Natalyaskaya Ploshchad, stands a monument in honor of the hermit Natalya. Natalyaskaya Ploshchad practically runs into another square, named after Yuri Sansurov who sacrificed his life for the sake of young tsar Alexei the Twin. Outside Gardener’s Quarter is Chistoye Boloto, the clean bog, into which Sansurov led the Vikmordere who had come to capture the Klavekian tsar, there by sacrifying himself for his tsar.</p>\n<p>The Gardener’s quarter has an elk farm in honor of Natalya the hermit. This is one of the few places in the world where druids have been successfully breeding elks for 90 years now. Pilgrims can not only take a good look at the elks but interact with them too. Trying elk milk is an absolute must since it has an unusual flavor and is known to grant divine favors every few years.</p>\n<p>There are about 15 gardens and parks in the Gardener’s quarter alone. A favorite recreation spot is the pine wood within its center. Here is the Klavekian Calling celebrated, the traditional custom for greeting the spring, calling the elks and the warming sun. Its on a small but long hill with a spring near its top, and in winter few children can resist the temptation to slide down the frozen slippery slope on their backsides or on sledges. The spring is also famous throughout Mohkba for its water purity.</p>\n<p>There are more than 13 bridges in the quarter. Many artisans come here for inspiration, which visitors are reminded of by monuments to writers, painters and druids that decorate gardens, parks and promenades. In the warm season there are six fountains in the squares and parks leading to ponds, little waterfalls and a boulder three-span bridge decorated with a unique carved iconostasis of rose, walnut and birch.</p>\n<p>Gardeners quarter was once the private property of the son of a simple Gardener. In childhood he fled from his father to a neighboring village, where he lived with the priest and sang in church. His beautiful voice drew the attention of a major who was driving by, who took the boy and brought him to Mohkba, to the delight of the tsarina, Tatjana Valakova, who loved his beautiful singing. The 22-year-old ‘voice of an angel’ became involved with the princess Anna Alexeievna. After she became tsarina, she awarded her lover some property and the rank of general, marrying him in secret. The influence wielded by this favorite of the tsarina became colossal, as did his wealth and land ownership. However, Gregory the Gardener remained throughout a modest and pious man, who financed the construction of many churches and always viewed his exalted status with humor. Later, when offering an explanation for Anna’s choice, one of her nieces recalled Gregory as one of the most beautiful men she had met in her whole life. After his death he dedicated his beloved garden to the people of Mohkba, to be tended by druids, and thus Gardener’s Quarter was founded and named after him.</p>\n<h2>Zveni Island</h2>\n<p>The Mohkba Lake’s individual shape can be explained by its glacial origins. It is in fact several lakes, joined to each other by short narrow canals, stretching in a chain from west to east for 50 kilometers. At its eastern end, at the mouth of Serpent Tail River, is Zveni Island. Its thus far away from the capital, but Alexei the Twin deemed it so important that he named it part of the capital itself, and that was never changed. The decision made Mohkba the biggest town of the world, at least if one measures size by east-west miles.</p>\n<p>On the remote Zveni island a monastery had been built, which today is connected with the mainland by bridge. In the early days of the empire a hermit called Gregory settled on the island. He was given the nickname Stolbensky, from the word “stolb” meaning pillar. After his death, fame spread far and wide of his the healing power, and the monastery became a center of pilgrimage, one of the largest in Klavekia. Not many years later an unique ensemble came together, and today the monastery comprises seven churches and 30 buildings in the tradition of Mohkba architecture. The shores of the island were reinforced with granite embankments. The monastery became a veritable “city of clerics,” a little part of Mohkba by some miracle abandoned in the wilderness of the region.</p>\n<p>As told in a legend, Zveni got its name, ‘bell-tolling’, thanks to its bells, which rang out for hundreds of miles around. When neighboring villages heard them, they also began to sound the alarm by tolling bells, and so on until the signal reached Mohkba, warning the capital of the kingdom of the approach of the Vikmordere enemy. Thus, Zverni was destroyed many times, and rebuilt after every attack. The Tsars did this in part out of piety, in part out of military thoughts and in part because the island became sort of a repository for unwanted wives and daughters and politically dangerous persons of both genders. To die on the island is said to grant a dying limited wish, but it has to be worded carefully and can’t have a political or military approach, for the first tsar who had died on the island, Gregory the Other Twin, also known as the Shortlived, had wished it so.</p>\n<p>Entry to the monastery is through two arches, one of which stands at the bridge, and the other at the pier. Rebuilt only a few years ago, it nonetheless is famous for its rich decoration of klavekian baroque and frescoes in the style of oreadean masters. The main hall is bright and spacious with four pillars that bear arches. On the walls are two thematic series: seven paintings depicting the various battles with the Vikmordere and four illustrating the Miracles of Gregory Stolbensky.</p>\n<p>Water clarity in this part of the lake can be up to 5 meters. The lake is inhabited by about 20 species of fish, including smelt, bream, perch, burbot, whitefish, ide and pike, but also the occasional sea serpent. The forests are rich with game and poultry. There is a park on the shore, overlooking the lake, and a cape in the south of the island is covered with meadows. On the very point of the headland is a snow-white church which has miraculously survived the last two Vikmordere attacks unharmed.</p>\n</div>","markdown":""},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"sort":700000,"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}},{"name":"Klavekian Grasslands","type":"text","_id":"J642N3NDDUewmTFn","title":{"show":false,"level":1},"image":{},"text":{"format":1,"content":"<div class=\"aventyr\"><p class=\"s5\">Klavekian Grasslands</p><h2>Weather</h2><p>The winters on the Klavekian Grasslands last seven to nine months. Temperatures vary from −40 °C to 36 °C throughout the year. The summers are short but sometimes even hot, with plant life exploding as to make up for a whole year in but a few weeks.</p><p>The grassy plains in the Klavekian lowlands are a very windy area, with winds often blowing upwards of 40–90 km/h. It lies on top of permanently frozen soil called permafrost.</p><p>During the spring, the permafrost thaws just enough to let plants grow and reproduce. The ground below it stays frozen though, so the water can’t sink low, and so forms the streams, lakes and marshes found during the snowless months.</p><p>Rivers of the Klavekian Grassland flow over the same permafrost, so they erode their banks rather than the bottoms. They usually consist of countless channels, and can be difficult to cross. Most of them dry out after the end of the thawing period, leaving not many traces behind them until the next spring.</p><p>Most of the permanent rivers freeze to the bottom in some places. Water breaks the ice and then freezes on top of it. These ice plugs, called naled in the region, often don’t melt until the next autumn. If this happens on the important Serpent Tail River, which connects the @UUID[.ulLkhApELbg08M4o]{Klavekian mainlands} to the @UUID[JournalEntry.ismpCNWpGHvB1iPw.JournalEntryPage.Erya8w29cRTTJELu]{Serpent Lake}, it’s a major obstacle for trade, so the government sends spellcasters to remove these dangers by magical fire. Travel is not easy in these times of the year, and sometimes there are casualties in spite of the government efforts. Locals want the magicians to be permanently located near their villages, or at least for the duration of winter, but that has not been ordered so far despite of the protests.</p><p></p><h2>Flora</h2><p>As soon as the snow melts, the “Klavekian Pervenets” (The Firstborn) grows up thickly around the rivers and lakes. This huge grassy plant announces the start of the growing season after the winter is gone. Its juice has a sweet taste, but leaves blisters and sores on the skin that ache for months and has a 50% chance of lowering the dexterity score by one point until healed. The people of the three villages extract a form of sweet sugar out of it, and also distill wine that produces wonderful dreams after just one or two glasses. The dreams can carry portents sometimes; there is a 5% chance per glass drunk, up to a maximum of 10%, that the drinker can cast augury like a caster of third level right after waking up, regardless of his real class level or even if she is no spellcaster at all. The augury may happen or not, but another side effect does always take place; in the morning the drinker feels miserable and is nauseated for the next three hours per glass imbibed. Strangely the wine distilled out of Klavekian Pervenets as well as the juice itself loses its potency after only three days, so transporting it to larger markets is a huge challenge.</p><p>Maybe even better known in Klavek is one kind of plant that appears shortly after the Firstborn, but keeps growing in huge patches until late autumn. Talgana is a truly giant herb that reaches up to 3,5ms in height, a remarkable example of the famously tall forms of Klavek flora. In autumn, the stems can hide a wooly rhino easily. Inside the thickets, the sun and skies are hidden by the broad leaves, and bears’ paths cleave the wall of stems like tunnels. Talgana’s leaves are soft and its stems are easy to move apart with hands or a stick. Its young sprouts are edible, so much so that for bears they are a remedy against hunger in the early summer when there are neither berries nor fish yet. In winter-time, with snow on their umbels, these giants look like exotic trees, and numerous stories for children link them to fairies, but such a link is not proven by sages. They finally cave-in under their white burden when winter takes its course.</p><p>Aside from these endemic plants, this region supports numerous other species of rare flora, particularly grasses, herbs and shrubs. These shrublands are difficult to cross and full of bugs and other insects in summer, but they are a much better place than the neighboring regions for surviving the winter. A lot of wildlife uses them as shelter.</p><h2>Fauna</h2><p>One of the world’s largest herds of moose breeds in the Klavekian Grasslands, and there are three kinds of elk living here, from the smaller normal elks up to the river elk and then onto the megaloceras, but all in all the region is known for its megafauna. Vast herds travel the flatland, most of them following the seasons by going north in spring and south in autumn. They are followed by their predators like the smilodons or ice trolls in most cases, but there are exceptions to the hunting techniques used by creatures such as this, as described in the next paragraph.</p><p>One of the greatest predators in the Grasslands is the addanc, which lives like a beaver and builds dams. When prey tries to cross the water in its territory, it attacks like a crocodile. The various oozes of the region, most notably the grey ooze, the glacial ooze and the white pudding, also tend to be lurking hunters. However, the king of the Grasslands is the one-eyed frostwurm, which even attacks herds of mammoth. It radiates cold, is 35 feet long and weighs 8,000 pounds.</p><p>Other strange hunters include the flightless Ahlinni-birds or the hunting parties of Mimi, the sole fairy of the Grasslands, which have their villages mostly in the nearby forest, but roam the plains for prey. Also on the plains are the fogwarden (spelt the same for singular and plurals), aberrations that look like fog taking a humanoid form. The sight of their ice blue eyes has doomed more than one adventurer who had seen herself as a predator, not prey.</p><p>Maybe the most unusual species for this environment is the Kolasuchus, an amphibian, because it is known for surviving deep freezes, as low as -35 to -40°C. In some cases Kolasuchi have been known to remain frozen in permafrost for years, and after thawing, just walking off.</p><h2>Lake Voltaran</h2><p>One of the few permanent lakes in the Klavekian Grassland is Lake Voltaran, an enormous flooded volcanic caldera where more than a million salmon gather and spawn every year. The water is warm and doesn’t freeze in winter due to volcanic activity or a quasi-dormant gate to the Elemental Plane of Fire, depending on what sage you are listening to. The lake is a lifesaver for many species in the dead of winter, prey or predator, but a hunting ground for very dangerous monsters also. Travelers are wise to avoid it if their lifes don’t depend on its warmth.</p></div>","markdown":""},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"sort":800000,"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}},{"name":"Klavekian Staffweaving","type":"text","_id":"1hMoSKS1OqlchIwq","title":{"show":false,"level":1},"image":{},"text":{"format":1,"content":"<div class=\"aventyr\"><p class=\"s5\">Klavekian Staffweaving</p><h2>The Blank Staffs</h2><p>When confronted with the strange @UUID[JournalEntry.QlctNkzE9injOde9.JournalEntryPage.I4CpK8rTs0HgD7hW]{Vikmordere} magic the traditional wizards of the @UUID[.ulLkhApELbg08M4o]{Klavekian Empire} were at first at a total loss. No one had ever seen such magic as the savage Northmenn could wield. The Vikmordere wouldn’t explain how they did it for obvious reasons and Vikmorere prisoners sooner died then shared tribal secrets. Explorers sent to neighboring lands came back empty handed also.</p><p>Finally, Tarissov the Leprous, Magister of the Klavekian Academie of Magical Arts, came forth with a solution for at least part of the problem. He invented the famous Blank Staffs, magical tools to not only explore foreign magic, but to steal its secrets to a degree. When a spellcaster is hit with a Blank Staff she loses a prepared spell to it. The owner of the Blank Staff can then use the stolen spell. Strangely, when the user of a Blank Staff would be able to cast the stolen spell on its own, the magic vanished, but leaving the Blank Staff rechargeable once more. In the times when the Blank Staff was invented, those magic has not vanished at all, but been transferred to Tarissov the Leprous himself, who in this way became mightier and mightier. Finally, he felt strong enough to challenge the tsar himself, but he overestimated his abilities and was finally slain after what is known as the War Without Faces. Where the magic of a Blank Staffs vanishes now is uncertain, some speculate that Tarissov the Leprous isn’t dead at all, still accumulating power, other say the magic simply dripples away.</p><p>The magic needed to create Blank Staffs went to the grave with Tarissov the Leprous and is lost. But since the traitor-magician wanted the Blank Staffs to be spread wide he produced great amounts of them and sold them cheaply in what was viewed as a patriotic act those days. The Blank Staffs aren’t cheap anymore, but still readily available on the Magical Fair, charged or uncharged. Buyers have to beware though, there are Blank Staffs staffs with magic in them that no one can use, since the user has to be able to understand the magic in the staff on principle. An arcane specialist can’t used a stolen divine spell. The Vikmordere do have something entirely different sometimes, the so called mosaic magic. Only rarely are staffs with mosaic magic useable by any non-Vikmordere in Klavek.</p><h2>Empty Staffs</h2><p>While the magic to create @UUID[.1hMoSKS1OqlchIwq#the-blank-staffs]{Blank Staffs} is lost, the general art of staffbinding has made strides in @UUID[.ulLkhApELbg08M4o]{Klavek}. In these days it is possible to create staffs that are empty in their own ways. The procedure of creating them is expensive and time consuming, but also very flexible. The exact method is a guarded secret of the Klavekian Academie of Magical Arts, but the effect is, when a buyer wants a specific staff, he has to pay an extra amount of money equal 20%, but gets his staff in but 24 hours, for the raw Empty Staff had been prepared in advance. Since other nations still use methods that take a hundred days to produce an individual staff, Klavek’s magicians have a sharp competitive edge in emergencies or with clients not known for their patience. On the other hand, the Magical Fair is known to have most common staffs readily available to buy at normal costs if one spends some time searching, so Empty Staffs would usually be only required for exotic or rare inventions if it was just a matter of speed. With a successful DC 15 Spellcraft check the Empty Staff can be filled with additional magic for the usual fees (and 20%) by a skilled staffweaver, though a failed check makes the Empty Staff unusable for a full moon circle (a month). Empty Staffs are used for Bonded Objects or by wizards who don’t want to use an Efficient Quiver to sort through their magical staffs.</p><h2>Two Staff Weaving</h2><p>Klavekian spellcasters have perfected the art of fighting with staffs since Tarissov the Leprous days. Lukov the Fencer was the first magician to invent the art of Two Wand Weaving, and this feat is still popular in modern Klavek.</p></div>","markdown":""},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"sort":900000,"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}},{"name":"Lineage of Klavekian Tsars","type":"text","_id":"T3yjCTV19TztrWUu","title":{"show":false,"level":1},"image":{},"text":{"format":1,"content":"<div class=\"aventyr\"><p class=\"s5\">Lineage of Klavekian Tsars</p><ul><li><p><strong>About -520-490:</strong> Years of the Angry Sea, the Kraken terrorizes the eastern shores of what is today’s modern @UUID[.ulLkhApELbg08M4o]{Klavek}</p></li><li><p><strong>About -500:</strong> @UUID[.dwAJ5Jtc6ii8zQoh]{Mohkba} founded by Prince Yuri Dvagaslov, the Holy Knight of the Crossroad. @UUID[.LGCNFtJ4cWlq0HjE#divine-quarter]{The Sophianeum }is built in Mohkba, or, by a different account, the city is built where the Sophianeum already stood.

This magic, along with the town’s position on the river, may be why the town is as prosperous as it is.

The loremasters of this tale say that Nearru fashioned the stone and Jazoh cut through it as a mark of their union.</p>\n<p>The town itself is chaotic, disorganized, and, at times, barely functional. Holds up at the docks are not helped by Dockmaster Casta, who tries to get his greedy fingers into as many pies as possible. From charging unheard of (and obscenely high) “docking fees,” “cargo fees,” or “passenger fees,” that money goes straight into Casta’s pocket. Although there have been numerous complaints to Marshall Mulcahey, Casta has a complex system of how the docks are run that no one else understands and Tatiana came to the conclusion that hiring a new dockmaster and untangling everything at the docks would end up costing more than the town can afford, so she allows Casta to charge these fees, but talks with him occasionally about making sure some of those funds make their way to the city coffers.</p>\n<h2>Torrent</h2>\n<p><strong>Alignment and Type:</strong> True Neutral small town</p>\n<p><strong>Modifiers Crime:</strong> +1, Law -3, Lore +1, Society +4</p>\n<p><strong>Qualities:</strong> Academic, Notorious</p>\n<p><strong>Danger:</strong> 10</p>\n<p><strong>Disadvantages:</strong> –</p>\n<p><strong>Government:</strong> Magical</p>\n<p><strong>Population:</strong> 275</p>\n<p><strong>Notable NPCs:</strong> Matron Elizabeth Dunleavy, Daughter of Nature (CN, female, Klavek (human), Druid 11), Yugorg Daemonbreaker, Jailor (LN, male, ogre, Fighter 6)</p>\n<p><strong>Base Value and Purchase Limit:</strong> 1,300/7,500</p>\n<p><strong>Spellcasting:</strong> 6th</p>\n<p><strong>Minor Items</strong> 3d4; <strong>Medium Items</strong> 1d6; <strong>Major Items</strong> –</p>\n<p>Torrent, named for the increase in the speed of the where the two rivers join, is the “middle child” of the Three Sisters.

Separated from the other nations by the blasted deserts of the North, and the cliffsides overlooking the ocean to their East, the outside interferences within their growing culture were few and far in between. Developing a spiritual belief system that relies heavily upon the animal spirits around them, as well as the spirits of the moon and sun, and heavily practicing human sacrifice, the N’rcul experienced a true miracle, when, following the passing of a beloved ruler, their leader returned from the grave, restored to life, stronger and filled with the power of the spirits themselves. Kham-a-Tael rose from the grave ignorant of the world outside of his lands, knowing no more of the mysteries of the world then his people, and truly believed that he and only he had been chosen to return from the other side by the spirits, as a sign to his people, a sign that the spirits are listening, and they are watching.</p>\n<p>Kham-a-Tael’s rising sparked a religious fervor within his people, a renewed strength within the nations under his name, and renewed hope for the future of these lands. It was into these lands that a pair of undead were drawn, sensing the power of a newly awakened, and extremely powerful, undead, an unlikely pair of traveling companions (The Vampire Davional, and the @UUID[.mALZCj1Avtm347FY]{Lich Malakittal}). Presenting himself to The Risen Lord within his sleeping chambers, Davional set about establishing nightly visits with the curious undead lord, building a rapport, staying only long enough each night to make sure the interest was there, until the two had gotten familiar enough with each other that the talks got lengthier and lengthier, building to the point that Davional and Malakittal were given rooms within the temples to better accommodate them. It was through these late night conversations that Davional began to educate Kham-a-Tael as to what he believed him to be (a mummy), and several of the abilities demonstrated by Kham-a-Tael supported the theories of the cunning vampire.</p>\n<p>It was within these conversations that Davional laid the seeds for Kham-a-Tael’s mistrust of the outside world, and allowing outsiders to know of the miracle of his rebirth, and in friendship offered to both Davional and his companion Malakittal a permanent place of safety within his lands as well. Davional, realizing the possibility, took the offer a step further, and countered the offer with a safe means of utilizing the resources of the lands to make both his own and Kham-aTael’s people profitable, while guaranteeing that outside influences would be kept at bay. Davional offered to take the edges of NaeraCull for his own people, the Wandering Nation, forming a living buffer between the N’rcul and the outside world, and begin setting up trade with other nations and consortium’s for the natural resources of the rainforest, with the people’s of the wandering nation and the N’rcul supplying the work force, splitting labor between the materials being harvested. Convincing the Risen Lord that it was only a matter of time before a force to large to repel would arrive and begin harvesting resources against their will, it was only logical that they preemptively set up trade relations of their own. All connections were made from Davional’s people, and work began immediately on gathering the Wandering Nation and building them a home to call their own, as well as setting up mining sites, harvesting camps, and farms to utilize local fauna such as the cacao and several other rare herbs.</p>\n<p>Of all the materials available however, the desert offered up the strangest, in the form of raw glass. The deserts of NaeraCull lie within the path of the Scorched Lands, and as such are subjected to temperatures that fuse dunes of sand into glass on a regular basis. Organizing a workforce comprised of constructs, golems and undead all under the watchful eye of a handful of trusted subservient necromancers, Davional has turned the harvesting and export of glass into an extremely lucrative enterprise.</p>\n</div>","markdown":""},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{"core":{"sheetClass":""}}},{"sort":200000,"name":"Malakittal","type":"text","_id":"mALZCj1Avtm347FY","title":{"show":false,"level":1},"image":{},"text":{"format":1,"content":"<div class=\"aventyr\">\n<p class=\"s5\">Malakittal</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center\"><strong>Malakittal, the shadow behind the thrones</strong></p>\n<p> </p>\n<img style=\"float:right;margin:0px 15px 15px 0px;border:0px\" src=\"modules/aaw-games-aventyr/Setting-images/Malekittal-272x300.webp\" width=\"272\" height=\"300\" />\n<p>The Lich who had no desire to be, Malakittal was a cruel and selfish child, gifted with an abnormal intellect amongst his peers, but a complete lack of social grace. Sold into apprenticeship to an older wizard, Malakittal’s father was more than happy to watch his son disappear over the horizon. It was that devalued concept that hardened the heart and soul of the boy who would, within the next year, poison and slay his mentor, and flee into the night with a collection of his tomes. Hiding in the underbelly of a city is an even easier thing to do when you have magical tricks at your disposal to trade with the local guild, and Malakittal soon found himself a means to get by while he studied. At least until the first time he lost control of a spell he was attempting to to cast, and it cost the life of a valued guild member. strung up and disemboweled, left to die, all should have ended in lonely violence for Malakittal, but such was not to be the case.</p>\n<p>Upon piercing the veil, and casting his gaze upon the first realms of death, as his life left his body, terror tore through the young man’s frame, for there was his arcane master, like a rabid dog, at the end of a chain held by a terrifying Demonic being. With the last breaths of life did Malakittal learn that he had interfered with a demonic pact, and had left his former teacher unable to uphold his end of the deal. Seeing no value yet within Malakittal, the Demon trapped his soul, binding it within a crystal prison, and used his foul magics to force lichdom upon what was left of the young man’s body. Sent back amongst the living, a thing of undeath and fear, Malakittal fled the city, and went even further into hiding. Several hundred years passed between that night in that back city alley, and the night everything would change for ever in the “life” of Malakittal. The night he met Davional.</p>\n<p>Davional was merely looking for a place to wait out the passing of a caravan. Transporting several relics from one temple to another, this caravan had enlisted the aid of a full contingent of Templars and a handful of Paladins, seeking to guarantee the safe arrival of their cargo. It was enough of a threat that Davional, a vampire with several generations of age to his name, felt it better to seek a deeper shelter until they had left his lands, rather than risk discovery and be forced to defend himself. It was this need for a deeper tomb that led the two unlikely friends to first meet, the charismatic vampire, and the antisocial lich. Davional, being ever the opportunist, recognized the power within his grasp, and manipulated the lich expertly, taking full advantage of his lack of social grace or experience, to earn the friendship and loyalty of this powerful being hiding from the world.</p>\n<p>Malakittal has been the shadow behind Davional ever since. When Davional relocated his people (the Wandering Nation) to NaeraCull, it was on the promise to Malakittal that the temperate environment would be good for him, and provide more opportunities to learn new arcane secrets. Establishing themselves within a land ripe with the cultural acceptance of human sacrifice has turned out to be of great amusement to Malakittal, as there is never a shortage of souls wishing to “aid” him in his research.</p>\n</div>","markdown":""},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{"core":{"sheetClass":""}}},{"sort":300000,"name":"The Dralman Documents","type":"text","_id":"Cxr0Se9MxlOrH7Ne","title":{"show":false,"level":1},"image":{},"text":{"format":1,"content":"<div class=\"aventyr\"><p class=\"s5\">The Dralman Documents</p><p></p><p>A skald of some renown, Theo Dralman was quested by the Grand University of @UUID[JournalEntry.QVrlu0lTv2vFtT5P.JournalEntryPage.dwAJ5Jtc6ii8zQoh]{Mohkba} to enter the dark jungle and learn all he could of the spirits to which the native people prayed, and how the @UUID[JournalEntry.QVrlu0lTv2vFtT5P]{Klavek Kingdom} could use this information to its own end. That was many years ago, and many of the legends spoken amongst the tribes that have encountered Dralman would lead one to believe that his goals have changed, and his search for knowledge has become something far more personal. Most of the legends speak of a man carrying a great many scars, as if he had been mauled to the edge of death, only to be spared and shown a new path. There exist a few rare copies of his incomplete work, taken to the coastal towns by couriers and those on safari…the Dralman Documents they have become known as.

What other species claim to be knowledge is called “<strong>Epatarkka</strong>”, meaning inaccurate, imprecise or unclear.</p>\n<p>Obor is also used to mean “the light that shows the way”, whether literally as “torch” or metaphorically as in “wisdom”.</p>\n<p>Obor is also a reclaimed insult, a derogatory, pejorative, politically inflammatory term. It was slang for animal pen (specifically cattle or sheep) in most lands, many years ago. The giants took the term back when they built the wall around Obor and began their isolationist policies</p>\n<h3>Obri</h3>\n<p><strong>Obri</strong> – meaning “Giants” and the title used by any giant talking to any other creature about giants as an entire species. For many species, Obri<strong> </strong>and Obor<strong> </strong>are interchangeable, despite the differences in meaning.</p>\n<h3>Definicni Obor</h3>\n<p><strong>Definicni Obor</strong> – meaning values that define giants. It is a divine position, one taken by a member of the clerical council. Although clan leaders are usually member of the <strong>@UUID[.bUzRK3wWLJPr3eIJ#obrovsky]{Obrovsky}</strong>, they frequently take advice from the members of this group.</p>\n<h3>Maakarioborkauppias</h3>\n<p><strong>Maakarioborkauppias</strong> – meaning “the makers and sellers of giant goods”; all trades belong to this group. It covers all known Crafts, from the most basic wooden utensils to the most complex of locks and traps, and Professions. Within towns and cities, guilds may exist if 10 or more inhabitants are involved in the same activity, but if asked which group they belong to by someone else, a craftsperson or giant of a particular profession will state, “Maakarioborkauppias.”</p>\n<h3>Maatilaoborllinen</h3>\n<p><strong>Maatilaoborllinen</strong> – meaning “owner of the giant lands” and the title used by those who farm or cultivate the agricultural areas of Obor. It is also the name used by members of the druid circle for its society. Rangers occasionally move between this group and the <strong>@UUID[.bUzRK3wWLJPr3eIJ#obrovsky]{Obrovsky}</strong>.</p>\n<h3>Mezioborovy</h3>\n<p><strong>Mezioborovy</strong> – meaning “across all giantkind”. It is an arcane position, one taken by a member of the wizard amalgamation or sorcerer collective. They frequently live slightly isolated lives as their magic can be unpredictable.</p>\n<h3>Obrovsky</h3>\n<p><strong>Obrovsky</strong> – meaning “of the giants”. It is a military position, usually populated by fighters, paladins and barbarians of all types and alignments, which can cause conflict of a deadly nature. It is by far the largest group of giants in Obor. Rangers occasionally move between this group and the <strong>@UUID[.bUzRK3wWLJPr3eIJ#maatilaoborllinen]{Maatilaoborllinen}</strong>.</p>\n<h3>Viceoborovy</h3>\n<p><strong>Viceoborovy</strong> – meaning “for every giant”. A political position usually associated with specific experts, bards and monks. This group can include clan and realm leaders if they wish, although few chose to except on ceremonial occasions.</p>\n<p>It is not known if there are any other societies or social structures used elsewhere by yet-to-be-encountered giant types.</p>\n<p> </p>\n</div>","markdown":""},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{"core":{"sheetClass":"core.JournalTextTinyMCESheet"}}},{"sort":200000,"name":"Language","type":"text","_id":"YvplRrSOlzeMa3MI","title":{"show":false,"level":1},"image":{},"text":{"format":1,"content":"<div class=\"aventyr\"><p class=\"s5\">Language</p><p>Usually called Votun (or very rarely the archaic version, Vutun, which is often seen in the most ancient of giant texts, such as those held by the @UUID[.0ru8kn3zml6fAvTq#frost]{frost giants}) by those who speak it. Originally it only had one form, but each giant-type has developed a dialect of their own as specific regions of Obor grew. It is perhaps the oldest language that exists amongst mortal creatures, with all other languages containing elements of it in either individual word or common phrases. As a language, it can clearly be traced back to Abyssal, Celestial and Infernal roots and is a primordial language.</p><p>Individual @UUID[.YvplRrSOlzeMa3MI#societies]{societal} and @UUID[.YvplRrSOlzeMa3MI#sub-types]{sub-type} dialects and variations are as follows:</p><h2><span id=\"Societies\">Societies</span></h2><h3>Votunobri</h3><p><strong>Votunobri</strong> – the basic language of all giants. Anyone who can speak this can communicate with any creature that is able to speak “Giant”. When most creatures say they can speak “giant”, this is usually the language they mean. However, in terms of complexity, it is a little like a child talking to an adult and giants often chuckle at the lack of sophistication and understanding of what is being said.</p><h3>Votunmenot</h3><p><strong>Votunmenot</strong> – ceremonial language used by all officials, but particularly the <strong>@UUID[.bUzRK3wWLJPr3eIJ#viceoborovy]{Viceoborovy}</strong>. Complex and enormously descriptive at times, it is punctuated by individual words which sum up what may have just taken 20 minutes to describe. It has a great deal in common with the language spoken by treants, which is another language which can be traced back to primordial times.</p><h3>Votunmyymme</h3><p><strong>Votunmyymme</strong> – the trade dialect of the <strong>@UUID[.bUzRK3wWLJPr3eIJ#maakarioborkauppias]{Maakarioborkauppias}</strong>, indicating that the giant itself, or an item made by the giant, is for sale. The dialect consistently suggests “we sell” as a group rather than individualizing any particular activity, reflecting the belief that all crafts and professions rely on each other to be successful.</p><h3>Votunruoka</h3><p><strong>Votunruoka</strong> – the group dialect of the <strong>@UUID[.bUzRK3wWLJPr3eIJ#maatilaoborllinen]{Maatilaoborllinen}</strong>, indicating that the group feeds giantkind, both in terms of providing raw food and cooked meals. It is another basic dialect that leaves little room for misunderstanding or use elsewhere. Giant druids use a form of this dialect.</p><h3>Votunsota</h3><p><strong>Votunsota </strong>–<strong> </strong>language used by the <strong>@UUID[.bUzRK3wWLJPr3eIJ#obrovsky]{Obrovsky}</strong>, full of martial phrases and strident exclamations as well as sections dealing specifically with might, power, arms and armor and battle tactics. It is a relatively straightforward language that can be used without confusion on a battlefield and doesn’t suffer from a possible misunderstanding in meaning when passed along a chain of command. It is at all times a practical and effective dialect.</p><h3>Votuntaika</h3><p><strong>Votuntaika</strong> – language used by the <strong>@UUID[.bUzRK3wWLJPr3eIJ#mezioborovy]{Mezioborovy}</strong>. Full or mysterious and arcane phrasing, it has elements of Draconic entwined within it. There are a number of mythical and legendary words of power within <strong>@UUID[.YvplRrSOlzeMa3MI#votuntaika]{Votuntaika}</strong> which act like metamagic feats when sufficiently understood and practiced, although these seem to only work for giants able to wield arcane power of some significance.</p><h3>Votunuskonto</h3><p><strong>@UUID[.YvplRrSOlzeMa3MI#votunuskonto]{Votunuskonto}</strong> – language used by the <strong>@UUID[.bUzRK3wWLJPr3eIJ#definicni-obor]{Definicni Obor}</strong>. As the language of religion, philosophy and guidance, it has to be clear and exact at all times. All texts and statements which deal with matters of the gods and the ways of giant life are now all recorded in <strong>@UUID[.YvplRrSOlzeMa3MI#votunuskonto]{Votunuskonto}</strong>, as well as the language they were originally received in. This has made the language a powerful tool in dictating the path the giants will take, as it links together the dictates of the gods over time.</p><h2><span id=\"Sub-types\">Sub-types</span></h2><h3><strong>Votunjatti</strong></h3><p><strong>Votunjatti</strong> – spoken by the @UUID[.0ru8kn3zml6fAvTq#athach]{Athach}. Whilst it is recognized by all Obri that athachs are actually aberrations, they are considered the Children of the Gods (see @UUID[.0ru8kn3zml6fAvTq#athach]{athach entry}). <strong>Votunjatti</strong> is even more simplistic than <strong>@UUID[.YvplRrSOlzeMa3MI#votunobri]{Votunobri}</strong>, a straightforward version that athachs have slipped into over the millennia. Some sages moot that it is in fact the gods’ original attempt at a language for a mortal creature (and that athachs are the first attempt at giants), an idea that is closely studied and debated.</p><h3><strong>Votunpilvi</strong></h3><p><strong>Votunpilvi</strong> – spoken by the @UUID[.0ru8kn3zml6fAvTq#cloud]{Cloud giants}. Although these giants have universally deep voices, the tone and flow of their dialect ranges between dark and brooding all the way to high and wispy, just as clouds themselves. Occasionally used by bards for songs and tales of attempts to take hold of the unobtainable.</p><h3><strong>Votuntupla</strong></h3><p><strong>Votuntupla</strong> – spoken by the @UUID[.0ru8kn3zml6fAvTq#ettin]{Ettins}. It is an odd dialect, one that is made up of repetition, double explanation or statement and sometimes cross purpose, particularly when arguments are taking place. It is (correctly) thought that the two heads of an ettin can each only speak part of their overall language capability and that if an ettin was to lose one head yet survive, they would find it very hard to communicate verbally.</p><h3><strong>Votunpalo</strong></h3><p><strong>Votunpalo</strong> – spoken by the @UUID[.0ru8kn3zml6fAvTq#fire]{Fire giants}, the dialect is, naturally, a fiery one, fully of inflammatory delivery and passionate appeals. It is a dialect that lends itself most easily to arguments and energetic activity. Many giants who wish to motivate those around them who make things include a smattering of this dialect.</p><h3><strong>Votunkuura/Votunhuurre</strong></h3><p><strong>Votunkuura/Votunhuurre </strong>– spoken by the @UUID[.0ru8kn3zml6fAvTq#frost]{Frost giants}, <strong>Votunkuura</strong> is a dialect with a significant number of clicking and cracking sounds in addition to actual words. <strong>Vutunhuurre</strong> is a little more delicate and is most frequently used to describe the lands within 100 miles of a frost giant’s home, particularly when discussing details of the natural environment.</p><h3><strong>Votunkunnas</strong></h3><p><strong>Votunkunnas </strong>– spoken by the @UUID[.0ru8kn3zml6fAvTq#hill]{Hill giants}. Like the hills themselves, the dialect is one that rolls, with noticeable peaks and troughs in delivery. It has a range of words to describe fertile land and is sometimes used by those in the druid circle to get complex points across to those knowledgeable about giants.</p><h3><strong>Votunmakeanveden</strong></h3><p><strong>Votunmakeanveden </strong>–<strong> </strong>spoken by the @UUID[.0ru8kn3zml6fAvTq#merrow]{Merrow}. It is a guttural dialect, full of liquid sounds and use of air bubbles in the throat. Not an easy dialect to get to grips with for those who do not speak Aquan.</p><h3><strong>Votunkaaos</strong></h3><p><strong>Votunkaaos </strong>– spoken by the @UUID[.0ru8kn3zml6fAvTq#ogres]{Ogres}. A highly-changeable, ever-adapting dialect that readily picks up words and phrases from other languages and, if spoken for relatively short periods in lands where other humanoids dwell, will morph into a good approximation of that land’s natives’ language.</p><h3><strong>Votunkivi</strong></h3><p><strong>Votunkivi </strong>– spoken by the @UUID[.0ru8kn3zml6fAvTq#stone]{Stone giants}, full of rumbles and grinding notes. Elders use a variation called <strong>Votunjalokivi</strong> when communing with the earth. Although it has close links to Terran, there are no recorded cases of non-stone giant elders being able to speak the dialect.</p><h3><strong>Votunmyrsky</strong></h3><p><strong>Votunmyrsky </strong>– spoken by the @UUID[.0ru8kn3zml6fAvTq#storm]{Storm giants}, it is an all-or-nothing dialect, sounding either at complete calm or alarmingly strident, even when being used, for example, to tell jokes.</p><h3><strong>Votunparantaa</strong></h3><p><strong>Votunparantaa </strong>– spoken by the @UUID[.0ru8kn3zml6fAvTq#trolls]{Trolls}, it is a dialect which can talk endlessly about any topic, given the chance. It folds back in on itself and develops and grows in a seemingly unstoppable way.</p><h3><strong>Votunalamaailma</strong></h3><p><strong>Votunalamaailma </strong>– spoken by the @UUID[.0ru8kn3zml6fAvTq#underworld]{underworld giants}, this dialect is frequently more easily used and understood by Underworld dwellers than other giants when first encountered. If listened to for a week, it becomes clear that it contains much that any other giant does actually understand but is a dark and shadowy version of Votun.</p><p>It is not known if there are any other languages or dialects used elsewhere by yet-to-be-encountered giant types. However, giant language and dialect is so heavily influenced by the land within which users live, particularly in delivery, that if giants do live in swamps, deserts or jungles, then it is more than likely that their dialect will have many components strongly influenced by those natural surroundings, such as the soft, shifting sounds of moving desert sands or dripping, lush noises of a tropical jungle.</p><p> </p></div>","markdown":""},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{"core":{"sheetClass":"core.JournalTextPageSheet"}}},{"sort":300000,"name":"Religion","type":"text","_id":"eSZclzdgw0E9gdK6","title":{"show":false,"level":1},"image":{},"text":{"format":1,"content":"<div class=\"aventyr\"><p class=\"s5\">Religion</p><p>The basis of all giant religion is called Vodoun. It is a traditional animistic religion; Vodoun origin, history and evolution centres around the vodoun spirits and other elements of divine and arcane essences that govern the Obor, a hierarchy that range in power from major deities governing the forces of nature and giant society to the spirits of individual streams, trees, and rocks, as well as dozens of ethnic vodoun spirits, defenders of a certain clan, tribe, or region as well as the nation as a whole.</p><p>The vodoun spirits are the centre of religious life, which is structured around doctrines such as the interaction of spirits (which usually manifest as angels, demons and devils) with living giants. A single adult giant is often a physical equal, if not superior, to an angel, demon or devil, so such interactions aren’t to be feared, more to be learned from.</p><p>Adherents also emphasise ancestor worship and hold that the spirits of the dead live side by side with the world of the living, each family of spirits having its own clearly-stated priesthood, sometimes hereditary, when the clerical or druidic responsibility is passed from parent to appropriate blood child.</p><p>Patterns of worship follow various dialects, gods, practices, songs and rituals. Vodoun recognises two overseeing creator deities with many lesser spirits called @UUID[.eSZclzdgw0E9gdK6#the-apulainen]{Apulainen (Helpers)}. The two creators, one divine and one arcane, called Pappi and Salainen respectively, are androgynous beings who combined to bear thirteen children. These children became the principal Apulainen spirits and Pappi and Salainen gave each rule over a realm of Obor.</p><p>The creators embody a dual principle of light and dark, in which Pappi represents light and the sun whilst Salainen represents darkness and the moon. Each aspect has good and bad points and is considered in positive and negative ways at different times for different reasons.</p><p>Of the thirteen children, twelve are still worshipped today. Each child, all also androgynous beings, now represents one of the twelve remaining giant types that live in Obor. Each giant type is loyal to their patron Apulainen, but gives praise and collection to Pappi and Salainen on appropriate days as well as to the lesser Apulainen of the society, clan and tribe they belong to, and to their own family spirits.</p><p>The thirteenth Apulainen represented the titans, who left Obor to travel the planes many millennia ago. They are no longer considered to be part of giantkind and are rarely referred to. It is considered to be extremely rude to talk of titans with any giant.</p><p>All creation is considered both divine and arcane, and therefore everything contains the power of both of these forces. This is how medicines such as herbal remedies are understood, and explains the casual use of mundane objects in religious ritual. Vodoun talismans, called “fetishes”, are objects such as statues, dried animal parts or manufactured items that are used for their healing and spiritually rejuvenating properties.</p><p>The @UUID[.bUzRK3wWLJPr3eIJ#definicni-obor]{Definicni Obor} and @UUID[.bUzRK3wWLJPr3eIJ#mezioborovy]{Mezioborovy }are entrusted to cast spells on or at enemies on behalf of supplicants, either calling upon vodoun spirits to bring misfortune or harm to a person or group or/and benefit to the supplicant. Sacrifice is a common way to show respect and thankfulness to the gods, usually consisting of something that has taken time, effort and energy to personally produce. Value is of secondary importance to these three factors.</p><p>Pappi and Salainen’s youngest child, @UUID[.eSZclzdgw0E9gdK6#ogres-–-kuopus]{Kuopus}, remains to this day in Obor and acts as a go-between with their other children; it is the principal Apulainen of the @UUID[.0ru8kn3zml6fAvTq#ogres]{ogres} and appears as either a young and virile female when something needs to be done urgently or takes the form of an old man when something needs to be learned and time is available.</p><p>The other chief Apulainen are listed below. After these principal Apulainen, there comes an entire range of lesser and least spirits. The most visible and easily recognised of these is Airut, a messenger spirit who relays messages between the giant world and the world of the Apulainen. It almost always takes the form of a dark, squat giant with a large bag over its shoulder and a pipe in its mouth. As the mediator between the gods and the living Airut maintains balance, order, peace and communication. Airut’s Pipe is able to cast spells and act as a weapon as it can transform into a two-handed hammer as a free action.</p><p>The principal Apulainen of the twelve giant types in Obor are listed below. Each can appear as a male or female as it chooses, or in its natural androgynous form. Each change is usually a free action that doesn’t provoke an attack of opportunity if undertaken in a situation where it is threatened.</p><p>The forms come complete with any clothing, armour and equipment the Apulainen choose to be wearing and carrying at that point. No item worn by an Apulainen remains if it chooses to leave Obor or if it is dismissed or banished. However, it is able to bring specific items to give to giants for a purpose.</p><p></p><h2>The Apulainen</h2><h3>Athach – Ennen</h3><p>Ennen appears as a five-limbed creature that chooses whichever configuration of limbs is most beneficial at that moment in time. It can change up to three limbs as a free action, but changing four or five is a move equivalent action. Although it mostly appears as either a male or female @UUID[.0ru8kn3zml6fAvTq#athach]{athach}, it can also appear as any four-legged beast that resides in Obor but have an arm sprouting from the middle of its back. Alternatively Ennen will walk amongst the athach as a rogue that is particularly dexterous, and attempt to get them to think about solutions to problems that don’t always involve brute strength.</p><h3>Cloud – Ylla</h3><p>Ylla will appear amongst the @UUID[.0ru8kn3zml6fAvTq#cloud]{cloud giants} as a male hunter with huskies or a female bard telling tales of lost souls. In both cases the form is neither particularly striking nor overly plain; it is in its actions that Ylla makes its point. It will also appear as a spectacular display of lenticular clouds over important events, either causing fear in the enemy or providing cover for attackers if required. Ylla will sometimes be found in the company of @UUID[.eSZclzdgw0E9gdK6#storm-–-salama]{Salama}, particularly when the latter is in dragon form, in a cloud form that confounds Salama’s abilities, allow each of them to hone their skills.</p><h3>Ettin – Kaksois</h3><p>Kaksois can appear as a martial-looking male or female @UUID[.0ru8kn3zml6fAvTq#ettin]{ettin} when it wishes to walk amongst its children. It can also appear as twins that are barely distinguishable from their faces but are clearly one male and one female if viewed in their entirety. The ettin forms are experienced and at their prime, whilst the twins are youngsters looking to gain help from the ettins and are a test of their tolerance and wisdom. Kaksois will occasionally appear as a sage, able to see both sides of an issue, and will mediate on a disagreement that hinders progress, whether of an individual ettin or the whole race.</p><h3>Fire – Hotkia</h3><p>Hotkia will appear as a burning fire giant to its followers, either a female cleric or male “paladin”, both of which will look to lead the @UUID[.0ru8kn3zml6fAvTq#fire]{fire giants} it has visited to greater glory. Hotkia will also appear as ceremonial fire at events where such is in place, which is just about every event you can think of that involves fire giants. The flames will be the purest red that any fire giant has seen, with the heat being a cleansing rather than damaging experience.</p><h3>Frost – Valkoinen</h3><p>Valkoinen chooses to appear either as a female ranger out to accompany those who face peril alone or as a monk accompanying travellers and asking them to test themselves as a group, perhaps to complete tasks they never imagined they would face. Valkoinen will also appear as snow fall where every flake is the same or as a layer of frost where every crystal is identical. In either case, it takes a cleric of Valkoinen 2d6 rounds to spot this, a follower [[/roll 2d4]] minutes and anyone with knowledge of giants [[/roll 5d6]] minutes. Once the snow or frost has finished falling ([[/roll 3d2]] hours), it will rise up into Valkoinen’s androgynous form and consider answering requests.</p><h3>Hill – Lehti</h3><p>Lehti appears either as a druid or as a barbarian, male or female. In any of these forms, Lehti is quite young, and always younger than the @UUID[.0ru8kn3zml6fAvTq#hill]{hill giant} it is appearing before. It will often offer to act as a helper for an individual hill giant going about an important or necessary task, slowly showing a more effective or efficient way of completing that task. Only when the task is complete and the hill giant concerned has thanked its new young friend will Lehti reveal itself in its true form, a cross between a hill giant and a treant, although much more like the former.</p><h3>Merrow – Jokijarvi</h3><p>Jokijarvi tends to present an appearance that is overwhelming: as a colossal elder water elemental, engulfing island-size patch of sentient seaweed, or a colossal kraken. It is even said that the great lake serpents are a taken form. At other times, Jokijarvi will walk amongst the @UUID[.0ru8kn3zml6fAvTq#merrow]{merrow} as a cleric, or very occasionally sorcerer. The merrow aren’t known for their spell casting ability, and every now and then Jokijarvi will conduct an “enlightenment drive” to ensure knowledge is spread by more merrow than shamen and tribal elders. These drives involve finding up to a dozen young merrow and providing the “Mark of All Merrow,” a birthmark that actually taps into innate spell casting ability and brings it forth.</p><h3>Ogres – Kuopus</h3><p>Kuopus is generally happy to let the image of @UUID[.0ru8kn3zml6fAvTq#ogres]{ogres} as crude boors ride, because it means they have to learn to stand on their own two feet and be rewarded by a distinct place in the world. Taking the typical barbarian form of the ogres, Kuopus encourages robust tournaments designed to let the cream of the ogres rise to the top, even as the god appears as an old man. But at other times, Kuopus walks amongst the ogres as the most charming and eloquent of their type, encouraging a self-expression that is usually held in almost brutal check. Often female, but not exclusively, Kuopus appears as a bard or story-telling illusionist, and revels that the ogres throw themselves whole-heartedly into can last for weeks. These revels encourage the often down-trodden ogres to face a world that despises them with renewed vigour. Kuopus is also the go-between for the other gods.</p><h3>Stone – Paasi</h3><p>The @UUID[.0ru8kn3zml6fAvTq#stone]{stone giant} people rarely see Passi, but they know their god is amongst them at all times. Passi IS stone, and has adopted the stone giants because of their affinity with the material, and is present as the mountains and lands the giants live on, work with, and use as tools, homes and weapons. If Passi does appear in a clearly recognisable form, it is as a travelling elder at a moot, or as an expert in some problem, stepping in to advise and guide, but never tell, a stone giant council or individual how to move on from an issue OR not make a mistake through a particular curse of action. Occasionally Passi will take the form of an ideal earth elemental from the dreams of stone giant children, although this is really just a slight variation in Passi’s usual form of stone itself.</p><h3>Storm – Salama</h3><p>Salama is a slightly contrary god, usually appearing as the opposite of the @UUID[.0ru8kn3zml6fAvTq#storm]{storm giant} who receives a visit. A heavily-armed fighter will see Salama as a robed monk, a wandering ranger sees a desk-bound mage or sage, an aristocrat sees a commoner, males see a female, and so on. Salama enjoys changing perception as much as the weather, and will present a form that encourages introspection and then release of hidden talents and unexpected innate abilities. If angry, Salama appears as a force dragon of a size sufficient to frighten whoever is the annoyance into an apology; all storm giant tales relate that Salama has never killed anyone or anything in this form, preferring to humiliate them and leave them bereft of all belongings and dignity. However, those tales also say that if Salama does kill someone when in dragon form, it will herald the end of the world. Salama is sometimes found with Ylla, who provides a worthy sparring partner for Salama’s force dragon form.</p><h3>Trolls – Oliivi</h3><p>Oliivi was once a simple @UUID[.0ru8kn3zml6fAvTq#trolls]{troll}, just like those walk Obor to this day. The difference between Oliivi and the trolls that came before is that the now-god found a way to channel the chaos and evil that trolls live by into unifying forces. Oliivi is actually responsible for introducing the isolationist views that all giants now hold, encouraging trolls to use their chaotic ways to promote troll clans over all others, and their evil approach to ensure troll elite were able to come out on top in any situation. Today, Oliivi will appear amongst the trolls as a ranger or druid of either sex, often when a tribe has fallen to ways that are too chaotic or too evil; after appearing out of seemingly nowhere, Oliivi will once again show that the way for trolls to succeed is to channel their natural instincts outwards onto others, not onto each other. This is a never-ending task</p><h3>Underworld – Maan–Uumenissa</h3><p>Little is known about Maan-Uumenissa, even by the @UUID[.0ru8kn3zml6fAvTq#underworld]{underworld giants} themselves. Stories say that the god bears the weight of the entire world at all times, and that providing places for the underworld giants to live and thrive is enough to give thanks for. Maan-Uumenissa is actually currently in torpor; when the world was struck by the “Shard of the Sun”, the carnage it caused (such as the Scarred Lands) struck the god deeply, and now Maan-Uumenissa rests to heal wounds that have damaged an entire planet. The god does visit the underworld giants on very rare occasions, usually as the ghost a mage who concentrates on spells associated with stone and force, or as the spirit of an expert stone mason able to carve a place to live from the solid mass of the Underworld. It is rumoured some @UUID[JournalEntry.QlctNkzE9injOde9.JournalEntryPage.t4LZuyNruvzneOHD]{deep dwarves} also worship Maan–Uumenissa, tapping into the god’s ability to work with stone to create particularly spiritual places far below the surface of Obor. If an alliance of these dwarves and giants ever occurs, other races will almost certainly find themselves out of a home.</p><p></p></div>","markdown":""},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}},{"sort":400000,"name":"Race History","type":"text","_id":"0ru8kn3zml6fAvTq","title":{"show":false,"level":1},"image":{},"text":{"format":1,"content":"<div class=\"aventyr\"><p class=\"s5\">Race History</p><h2>Athach</h2><p>Athach – The athach people came about as a result of <em>Pappi</em> and <em>Salainen</em> gathering together all the children of the other giant races that didn’t quite match the ideal they had in mind for them. They saw the advantage of a race that confounded belief, both within Obor and without, and ensured the newly-named athach race survived and, in its own way, flourished, with <em>@UUID[.eSZclzdgw0E9gdK6#athach-–-ennen]{Ennen}</em> charged to watch over it. To this day, the athach view themselves as special and chosen, but this knowledge is often enough to drive them to the brink of madness.</p><p><strong>Leader: </strong>Kolme Kadet - 5th level bard, 5th level fighter (Cha 13)</p><h2>Cloud</h2><p>Cloud – The cloud giants came into being from the very air, as <em>@UUID[.eSZclzdgw0E9gdK6#cloud-–-ylla]{Ylla}</em>, drew air, earth, fire and water together and moulded them into the clouds. To this day, cloud giants are able to show how each of the four elements are part of their “whole”, and explain why this sum is greater than the individual elemental parts. At their death, the most venerated cloud giants are afforded a ceremony which ensures their bodies are returned to the four elements in equal parts, so they can influence the very being of future members of the race.</p><p><strong>Leader: </strong>Tupruta Kevyt 12th level cleric</p><h2>Ettin</h2><p>Ettin – Ettin tales relate that when they were created, their maker <em>@UUID[.eSZclzdgw0E9gdK6#ettin-–-kaksois]{Kaksois }</em>had so much for them to say and do that two heads were necessary in order to achieve all that was required of them. Unfortunately, <em>Kaksois</em> failed to give any indication which head was in charge and so discord is as frequent a visitor as harmony. It is also said that if the two heads of a single ettin ever achieve complete agreement on every matter for the duration of a full moon, ettins everywhere will rise to lead the Obri nation in a wise and benevolent way.</p><p><strong>Leader: </strong>Kaksikko Paa 13th level fighter</p><h2>Fire</h2><p>Fire – Fire giants originally consisted of outcasts from all other societies, hotheads and rabble-rousers who drove others to despair before finding themselves permanently banished in order to save everyone else’s sanity. Many retreated from the land that was known, taking to the depths and lost places away from the hills and mountains that giants were used to living in. <em>@UUID[.eSZclzdgw0E9gdK6#fire-–-hotkia]{Hotkia}</em> is talked of as if the god actually walked amongst the earliest outcasts, leading them to the fiery rifts and heights that others ignored. These travels took the nomads to <em>Aitotulivuori</em>, the largest, most internally-active volcano in Obor. From here the fire giant tribes and clans grew, descending deep into the earth at the same time. Eventually a rift to the Elemental Plane of Fire was discovered, and the identity of the fire giants properly established.</p><p><strong>Leader: </strong>Palo Halko 6th level expert, 6th level warrior</p><h2>Frost</h2><p>Frost – The frost giants hold that they were the first giants, when <em>Pappi</em> and <em>Salainen</em> took it upon themselves to count the flakes of snow that fell on the ring of mountains far to the north of what is now Obor. As they landed, each became a giant; the first of these were the frost giants, who took their place at the top of the mountains. Others that followed became the other races and moved elsewhere to live their live, making the frost giants the pre-eminent members of their species. At least that is what the frost giants say, and who’s to doubt them. Their artefacts are clearly older than those of any other race, whilst <em>@UUID[.YvplRrSOlzeMa3MI#votunkuura/votunhuurre]{vutunhuurre }</em>has no direct link with any other Obri language, other than <em>@UUID[.YvplRrSOlzeMa3MI#votunkuura/votunhuurre]{votunkuura}</em>. Elderly frost giants are also known to occasionally hibernate, something no other giant-type does.</p><p><strong>Leader: </strong>Routainen Tanner 10th level sorcerer (Cha 18)</p><p></p><h2>Hill</h2><p>Hill – Hill giants took their place amongst the other races when no other giant wanted to live on the “lowlands”. Instead, those who found themselves at the bottom of their own hierarchy move away and banded together on the low peaks and wooded slopes of the Obor hills, becoming their own people. Although this life was difficult, without any of the massive majesty other giant environs offer, <em>@UUID[.eSZclzdgw0E9gdK6#hill-–-lehti]{Lehti }</em>show this new clan how to make the most of their new life and home, things which the hills giants still guard with jealousy, even as many secretly wish they could trace their heritage and return to an original home.</p><p><strong>Leader: </strong>Alava Kumpu 12th level paladin (Wis 14, Cha 12)</p><h2>Merrow</h2><p>Merrow – Although only the most senior clerics or deep-in-trance sorcerers of their will admit it, the original merrow were giants driven from the Obor lands for acting in the worst interests of all Obri. The exact nature of their actions is unclear, but the guidelines of the <em>@UUID[.bUzRK3wWLJPr3eIJ#definicni-obor]{Definicni Obor }</em>make a number of statements that refer to the “outcasts beyond our shores”. To the uninitiated, this seems to simply mean non-giants; internally, it refers to the merrow. <em>@UUID[.eSZclzdgw0E9gdK6#merrow-–-jokijarvi]{Jokijarvi }</em>took up their cause at the request of <em>Pappi</em> and <em>Salainen</em>, who ultimately want all giants to live together, yet know that those who don’t think of the Obri first and foremost need to pay a price. This price is being cursed to ultimately have to live in water, with only short periods on dry land.</p><p>Saltwater merrow are thought to exist, but are very rare if they do.</p><p><strong>Leader: </strong>Vesi Pesa 14th level druid</p><p></p><h2>Ogres</h2><p>Ogres – <em>@UUID[.eSZclzdgw0E9gdK6#ogres-–-kuopus]{Kuopus’s}</em> ogres have always been viewed by other giants as the children of <em>Pappi</em> and <em>Salainen</em>; they are usually loud, vulgar, and act in an out-of-control manner should they pick up barbarian tendencies. But they have also always been the link between the Obri and the outside world. The elves first realised this and gave the giants a number of islands of their eastern coast, where a part-elf-part ogre race developed and flourished, in order for the Obri to present skilled diplomats to the rest of the inhabitants of the planet. To this day, the agreed representative of all the giants is a member of this race, and has been for as long as giants can remember. As the go-between between his parents and the other <em>apulainen,</em> <em>Kuopus </em>knows what it is like to be an emissary,<em> </em>and ensures the chosen <em>elgres</em> do the very best job they can at all times.</p><p><strong>Leader: </strong>Rumilus Hirmu 13th level barbarian</p><h2>Stone</h2><p>Stone – As <em>Pappi</em> and <em>Salainen</em> created the frost giants, <em>@UUID[.eSZclzdgw0E9gdK6#stone-–-paasi]{Passi }</em>sat on a rock and watched. Eventually the ground froze, and then cracked, as the cold seeped into it. From the shards of rock that were created when these cracks occurred, the first stone giants were formed. They were charged with protecting the ground that made up Obor from the frost giants, offering other giant types a chance to find a place to call home. As caretakers of the land, stone giants take their duties very seriously, and will engage with another creature only until it promises to stop harming the land. Then will turn from foe to friend in a moment, help heal the individuals concerned, and send them on their way.</p><p>The stone giants also built the wall that surrounds Obor; along with gnome engineers, the wall was created within a month, with time to spare to have giants everywhere test it by hurling rocks at it. To this day, it has survived any and all assaults.</p><p><strong>Leader: </strong>Jalo Marmori 11th level rogue (Dex 17)</p><h2>Storm</h2><p>Storm – The contrary nature of <em>@UUID[.eSZclzdgw0E9gdK6#storm-–-salama]{Salama}</em> is what drove storm giants to leave the land and take to the air. However, <em>Salama</em> couldn’t quite leave the land behind, and granted storm giants to ability to raise up huge flying citadels that float as might the lightest feather. To this day, tales of aggrieved storm giants uprooting villages and small towns to either save them or punish them occur in equal measure. Storm giants are also called on when drought has occurred as they can, for the right price, ensure enough rain falls to satisfy even the most water-starved area.</p><p>Storm giants have also traditionally overseen the flying fortress that holds a sliver of the “Shard of the Sun” in a highly-protected sphere that is used to power a particularly effective weather machine. This particular task has fallen to one family for many years now, as is a task that is undertaken with complete seriousness.</p><p><strong>Leader: </strong>Alykas Kipina 14th level wizard (Int 17)</p><h2>Trolls</h2><p>Trolls – Any troll will tell you that they spontaneously stepped from the ground the moment <em>@UUID[.eSZclzdgw0E9gdK6#trolls-–-oliivi]{Oliivi} </em>decided that it should be so, and that they will never leave the land until <em>Pappi</em> and <em>Salainen</em> ask them to go. This means not only the troll species as a whole, but also the individuals that make up its number, particularly those that are able to spur the troll nation to bigger and better rewards. Within the giant lands, trolls tend to keep to themselves, fitting in with all the other giant types almost unnoticed. However, when decisions are to be made, senior trolls appear seemingly out of thin air to voice their strongly isolationist views. The other side of this is that they make better-suited individuals for certain professions, and can be trusted to the very end once a deal has been struck (unless another troll is involved).</p><p><strong>Leader: </strong>Kasvaa Paluu 7th Level ranger, 6th level druid</p><h2>Underworld</h2><p>Underworld – As with <em>@UUID[.eSZclzdgw0E9gdK6#underworld-–-maan–uumenissa]{Maan–Uumenissa}</em>, little is known about the history of the underworld giants, more because it is shrouded in mystery rather than individuals not knowing. Nothing is clear about why the original members retreated to the depths, or how they managed to establish themselves once they were there. In fact, the first few giants to retreat into the Underworld were a band who could not decide which of the other <em>apulainen</em> to follow, so left the surface of Obor to follow another path. <em>Maan-Uumenissa</em> found them wandering in despair, and vowed to support them forever onwards, even though the weight of the world was on the god’s shoulders. Since then, Underworld giants have slowly adapted to their home, and are now experts at getting the most from the cold, hard rock around them.</p><p><strong>Leader: </strong>Alempi Kamara 9th level monk (Dex 14, Wis 14)</p></div>","markdown":""},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{"core":{"sheetClass":"core.JournalTextPageSheet"}}},{"sort":500000,"name":"Regions","type":"text","_id":"DGCq9pB33FlnM4rY","title":{"show":false,"level":1},"image":{},"text":{"format":1,"content":"<div class=\"aventyr\"><p class=\"s5\">Regions</p><h2>Ydin-koto</h2><p>The north coast that runs along the side of the @UUID[JournalEntry.QVrlu0lTv2vFtT5P]{Klavek Kingdom} is known as Ydin-koto (Original Home). It is a narrow range of massively tall mountains, some of which are built into the wall surrounding Obor. It is the home of the @UUID[.0ru8kn3zml6fAvTq#frost]{frost giants}, along with many @UUID[.0ru8kn3zml6fAvTq#cloud]{cloud giants} and some storm giants. Links to the Elemental Planes of Air and Earth can be found here, although none are permanent. A continuous storm, roughly 10 miles across, follows a circular path that is about 1,500 miles in circumference, travelling at between 15 and 20 miles a day. Much of this storm is out at sea, but it works its way along the coast for about six or seven days of every 86 day cycle</p><h2>Aitotulivuori</h2><p>The home of the @UUID[.0ru8kn3zml6fAvTq#fire]{fire giants} is Aitotulivuori, which is about three miles high and surrounded by the taller, frozen mountains. It is also situated to the north of Obor, and is considered part of @UUID[.DGCq9pB33FlnM4rY#ydin-koto]{Ydin-koto} by non-giants. There are a number of deep rifts around the base of the volcano, at least two of which descend around nine miles underground. At this depth, a permanent link to the Elemental Plane of Fire can be found, although very few creatures, including the fire giants themselves, ever make it there. Any that are encountered are usually extraplanar visitors, with many coming to or going from a summoning, having completed their part of a bargain or spell; almost all are seen leaving with payments of some kind, sometimes in kind.</p><h2>Ylä–mäki</h2><p>Ylä–mäki which sits in the bay at the top of mainland Obor, is the greatest peak in the country, standing at roughly 13 miles high. Deep within it are the entranceways to the Underworld and giants that make their home there. At its summit, a @UUID[.0ru8kn3zml6fAvTq#frost]{frost giant} observatory sits, watching the skies for the celestial conjunction that will signal ”The Beginning of the End”. This is either a time when all people will come together to live harmoniously, or is the first in a series of cataclysmic events that will trigger the implosion of Obor and its neighbouring lands. Unfortunately, the frost giants aren’t certain which it is that is going to happen. Outside of Obor, it is known as ”High Tor”.</p><h2>Keha and Kaari</h2><p>Off the northern shore are Keha and Kaari (the Ring and the Arc). These islands were formed when debris from the falling ”Shard of the Sun” landed and caused the seabed to rise up above the level of the surface in some places. The islands are often used by @UUID[.0ru8kn3zml6fAvTq#merrow]{merrow} as resting places if, for example, storms become too rough, or they are meeting non-giants for, for example, trading purposes. The islands are riddled with caves and narrow inlets, making currents around them treacherous. Giant pirates operate from here. The islands are also rather gem-rich, as the heat from their creation caused much of the raised seabed to turn to gems, but getting them is difficult.</p><h2>Taivas Tasanko</h2><p>There is a huge mesa plateau, Taivas Tasanko, on a disputed bulge of land that is almost surrounded by Klavek, roughly in the middle of that country’s southern border. The mesa is over three miles high and just about 400 miles in circumference, taking up the whole of the ”bulge”. The wall enclosing Obor is even built around the base of the mesa, to ensure continuity. This is where Pappi and Salainen first stepped on the planet, and is still the first stepping stone for all the apulainen when they visit. On the top of the plateau is a martial monastery and place of worship, Luostari. Every giant race is represented here, although it is not an “equal” place; for example, currently the @UUID[.0ru8kn3zml6fAvTq#athach]{athachs} are camped on the roof, whilst the @UUID[.0ru8kn3zml6fAvTq#merrow]{merrow} have to change their representatives every few days due to the lack of water.</p><h2>Raja Linnoitus</h2><p>The entire southern sea border of Obor is one huge military and governmental administrative building called Raja Linnoitus. This building, built entire for giant-sized occupants, is where anyone visiting Obor is officially allowed to enter. Anyone found in the country without the required paperwork issued from this place has just one chance to be taken into custodial care or will be executed on the spot. The giants are very particular about this. Only two groups – all @UUID[JournalEntry.QlctNkzE9injOde9.JournalEntryPage.lMtTJxWecu1ISdP0]{gnomes} from @UUID[JournalEntry.2cK9lISUylZwk24i]{Pradjna}, and @UUID[JournalEntry.QlctNkzE9injOde9.JournalEntryPage.ei36LjIhEoh87vgE]{elves} who are residents of the Elgres islands – are exempt.</p><h2>The southern border</h2><p>The southern border with the Scorched Lands, and western borders with the unclaimed territories and Pradjna, all have a series of airboat platforms every 50 miles along the protective wall. These towers are roughly half a mile high, with the only landing platform at the top and just one exit at the base. When the Pradjna gnomes helped the giants build the defensive wall around the whole country, the giants gave the gnomes the details of how to make the flying citadels that storm giants use. The gnomes developed airboats for both themselves and the giants, and requested that safe stations be placed on the joint border. These airboats are prized items, in particular those built for giants, and are defended at all costs. Any non-giant or non-gnome in possession of one will find that they receive constant requests to sell it, often for overly-large sums. Neither the giants nor the gnomes like them falling into the hands of other races.</p><h2>Kadotettu</h2><p>Off the coast of the Vast Swamp, towards its northern border with the Scorched Lands, Obor has ownership of an island, Kadotettu, which is the place where the titans left for other realms. It is unclear whether the loss of the titans from the giant population is considered a good or bad state of affairs; the titans were insisting on being allowed a stronger influence over the entire giant population just before their departure, a situation that was causing internal rifts throughout the rest of the @UUID[.bUzRK3wWLJPr3eIJ#obri]{Obri}. Eventually the titans’ request was refused and they left, which brought about a return to internal stability and a golden age when the rest of giantkind took significant strides forward. Kadotettu is now inhabited by a force of @UUID[.0ru8kn3zml6fAvTq#trolls]{trolls}, land-based and aquatic, that protects the ancient titan departure site from treasure hunters and glory-seekers. These trolls are all extremely experienced druids, rangers and sorcerers, for whom the service of guarding the island is one of great honour.</p><h2>Jattaltia</h2><p>At the southern end of the @UUID[JournalEntry.wVQiwLZtRuaqbpFA]{Silent Forest}, in a bay close to @UUID[JournalEntry.oVgfVPmxlNXfN3CW]{Timaeus} and a little further out to sea, Obor has sovereignty of a group of six islands called the Jattaltia. It is here that the ogre-elf clans, the Elgres in Common tongue, live; careful selective matchmaking continues to produce exemplary children who are trained to become the outward-facing elite of Obor. Korkein Esimerkki, 20th-Level Expert, is currently the main contact any of the other races have with Obor (except the gnomes of Pradjna) and he is a member of a prominent Jattaltia family that can trace its mixed lineage back for over 350 generations. These islands are almost identical in nature to the Silent Forest, yet most structures are giant-sized. They also each have an airboat docking tower.</p></div>","markdown":""},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{"core":{"sheetClass":"core.JournalTextPageSheet"}}}],"flags":{"cf":{"id":null},"core":{"sourceId":"Compendium.Aventyr-Campaign-Setting.aventyr-campaign.CZklpkirPVkYlgVp"},"scene-packer":{"hash":"fdd58e3603cfda298b3fd31731d921c0b1350b56"}},"_stats":{"systemId":"dnd5e","systemVersion":"2.1.4","coreVersion":"10.291","createdTime":1664018841723,"modifiedTime":1674975191536,"lastModifiedBy":"EsIYTtNnjwxUbKOG"},"_id":"CZklpkirPVkYlgVp","ownership":{"default":0,"R5IsvMTH5P79pBoG":3},"folder":"j9cXBagzZ1ARsO2I","sort":200000},{"name":"Picollo","pages":[{"sort":200000,"name":"Picollo","type":"text","_id":"Fo8ZyJ0HbBDVVALU","title":{"show":false,"level":1},"image":{},"text":{"format":1,"content":"<div class=\"aventyr\">\n<p class=\"s5\">Picollo</p>\n<img style=\"display:block;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto\" src=\"modules/aaw-games-aventyr/Setting-images/Picollo-map-750x277.webp\" width=\"496\" height=\"246\" /></div>\n<div class=\"aventyr\"> </div>\n<div class=\"aventyr\"><img style=\"float:right;margin:0px 15px 15px 0px;border:0px\" src=\"modules/aaw-games-aventyr/Setting-images/halfling-bosun-copy.webp\" width=\"204\" height=\"287\" />\n<p>Two hundred miles off the southern tip of @UUID[JournalEntry.oVgfVPmxlNXfN3CW]{Timaeus} lay the island nation of Picollo. Once an archipelago stretching deep into the southern ocean, much of its ancient lands were destroyed in the Great Schism, crushed by the falling body of the Dracoprime. Only the big island and a few scattered isles survived the cataclysm some 500 years ago, and since the disaster, the peoples and culture of @UUID[JournalEntry.QlctNkzE9injOde9.JournalEntryPage.myrc4omqUaiD3RKZ]{Halfling} society have struggled for their very survival, some might say for their very souls.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Ancient Picollo was first and foremost a peaceful realm of farmers, drinkers, and enjoyers of all the good stuff that life has to offer. Halflings were simple and open people, finding beauty in all the blessings that the gods placed upon their island homes. @UUID[.Gv1vyttllOYQaK2t#mainland-picollo-–-the-big-island]{Mainland Picollo – The Big Island} was covered in green rolling farmlands, save for the @UUID[.Gv1vyttllOYQaK2t#the-great-mountain]{The Great Mountain} in the north, and @UUID[.Gv1vyttllOYQaK2t#the-great-forest]{The Great Forest}to the west. The isles of the archipelago provided a diversity of agricultural products and stimulated halfling naval architecture and maritime trade; in its heyday, the merchant fleets of Picollo traded with most of Aventyr, and trading enclaves from other nations were common on the big island. Many of these grew into larger towns and cities, in contrast to halfling settlements, which remained centered on village life.</p>\n<p>The destruction of the Great Schism changed the face of Picollo forever. The two hundred years following the cataclysm were consumed by efforts to survive and rebuild, but just as the land and people started to recover, @UUID[JournalEntry.QlctNkzE9injOde9.JournalEntryPage.SGw7zGFtvjLNPDMY]{Hoyrall} burst onto the scene. For two centuries the aliens tunnelled inside the great mountain, and then to other parts of Aventyr through the caverns and tunnels of the Underworld that intersected with the new construction. Hives that remained behind launched a full scale invasion of the halfling lands—the invading force wiped out halfling villages everywhere they went, colonizing the land and setting up new hives like mindless drones. The only diplomacy they engaged in was to strip away the alliances of the human settlements in Picollo; the twicelings thought themselves safe but when the ties were cut, the hoyrall broke their agreements and turned, destroying them utterly.</p>\n<p>The remaining halflings took to the forest and isolated slopes of the great mountain. Stealth, trickery, and valiant assaults kept the sorely pressed halflings from being completely overrun, but it was the Confluence and breaking of the hoyrall hive-mind that allowed them to make headway against the invaders. The halflings joined forces with the fey of the great forest and the @UUID[JournalEntry.QlctNkzE9injOde9.JournalEntryPage.t4LZuyNruvzneOHD]{Dwarf} of @UUID[.Gv1vyttllOYQaK2t#stoneroot]{Stoneroot}, wiping their land clean of the insectoid invaders.</p>\n<p>Recovery has been slow; @UUID[JournalEntry.QlctNkzE9injOde9.JournalEntryPage.myrc4omqUaiD3RKZ]{Halfling} tribes returned to their homes to find everything their ancestors had built completely destroyed. They had to start from scratch and build anew. Though once drawn together by a common enemy, despair and exhaustion has taken its toll. In ancient times, nearby villages often joined together to accomplish greater projects than they could alone: now, the rebuilding of Picollo is insular and clannish. Desperate for labor but wary of other humanoids, indentured servitude has been introduced across the island for would-be immigrants. Travelers to these lands find scant welcome and are carefully watched, spied upon by night. Most visitors rarely travel further than the coastal ports due to the @UUID[.PmrSWZmvMcJz6g4H#xenophobia]{Xenophobia} in Picollan villages. Any non-halfling in the interior is assumed to be an @UUID[.PmrSWZmvMcJz6g4H#indentured-servitude]{Indentured Servitude}, or perhaps a freedman who has completed his term of service.</p>\n<p>Modern halflings pay lip service to the merry and celebratory traditions of ancient times, and the end of the wars means that the traditional festivals are once again being celebrated, but there is a darker shadow now to their people, an untrustworthy part.

Any elder visiting The Nines is free to participate in the ongoing debates and discussions; the Eldermoot serves more as a cultural communications hub rather than a legislative assembly. Its decrees and proclamations have only the force of recommendations to the villages throughout Picollo with the single exception of matters relating to indentured servitude and freedman colonies—both of which are strictly regulated throughout Picollo.</span></span></p><p style=\"box-sizing:border-box;user-select:text;margin:0.5em 0px;min-height:1rem\"><span style=\"font-family:Signika, sans-serif\"><span style=\"font-family:Signika, sans-serif\">The First Speaker, along with an advisory board of four Second Speakers, runs the meetings throughout the year and manages a professional team of scribes and servants that record the events in assembly. The First Speaker is elected every spring from amongst the elders present during the Festival of Renewal and receives a stipend to cover all costs of the administration (as well as his own personal living expenses) from funds collected at the close of each debate—some unpopular Speakers are reduced to penury when the donations dry up. Bribery within the Eldermoot is almost unheard of as most of the edicts of the Eldermoot have little force in law.</span></span></p><h3><span style=\"font-family:Signika, sans-serif\"><span style=\"font-family:Signika, sans-serif\">Board of Indentures and the Council of Freedmen</span></span></h3><p><span style=\"font-family:Signika, sans-serif\"><span style=\"font-family:Signika, sans-serif\">Since the introduction of @UUID[.PmrSWZmvMcJz6g4H#indentured-servitude]{indentured} servitude in Picollo some six cycles of servants have served their terms and achieved freedman status—many thousands more are serving out their indentureship. Responsible for the legislation and regulation of both indentured servitude and freedman rights, ten halfling elders sit on the Board of Indentures. The original ten elders were elected by the @UUID[.X0uyBqIKLevC15mx#the-eldermoot]{Eldermoot;} currently election to the board is the prerogative of the Council of Freedmen. The appointment is for life and the council has had the opportunity to elect only four replacements in the last fifty years. With these younger fellows, the six original members enjoy their venerable years dominating the most politically influential group in Picollo.</span></span></p><p><span style=\"font-family:Signika, sans-serif\"><span style=\"font-family:Signika, sans-serif\">The Council of Freedmen consists of seven freedmen serving the interests of both freedmen and indentures throughout Picollo. Its representatives are chosen not by the freedmen themselves, but by the Eldermoot at the same time as the speakers. A councillor serves a single term of seven years, and the terms are staggered so that a new councillor replaces a retiring one every year. The most powerful influence the council retains is the election of a member to the Board of Indentures, but as this opportunity comes rarely, one could argue how much influence actually resides within the prerogative.</span></span></p><p><span style=\"font-family:Signika, sans-serif\"><span style=\"font-family:Signika, sans-serif\">The council sits in the Eldermoot seven days out of every ten, but is granted the right to speak only on the first and last day of each cycle (the Right of Voice). The council usually meets in private during the three-day banishment, when the Eldermoot (advised by the Board of Indentures) is free to discuss freedman issues without prying ears.</span></span></p><p><span style=\"font-family:Signika, sans-serif\"><span style=\"font-family:Signika, sans-serif\">Legislation regarding freedman and indentured rights may only be proposed by members of the Board of Indentures, although freedman councillors can speak to the issue when they have the Right of Voice. Freedmen councillors also vote on proposed legislation. Passing, amending, or abolishing a law requires a majority vote on both the Board and the Council.</span></span></p><p><span style=\"font-family:Signika, sans-serif\"><span style=\"font-family:Signika, sans-serif\">Unlike election to the Eldermoot, bribery is commonplace in the Council of Freedmen and within the Board of Indentures. Members of both bodies are courted by conservative and progressive villages in regards to indentured rights, and having a tame freedman councillor or a friendly ear on the Board can be useful.</span></span></p><h3><span style=\"font-family:Signika, sans-serif\"><span style=\"font-family:Signika, sans-serif\">Guilds and Secret Societies</span></span></h3><p><span style=\"font-family:Signika, sans-serif\"><span style=\"font-family:Signika, sans-serif\">Though not part of formal government, Picollo is rife with guilds, collectives, and secret societies.

Gone are the days of bucolic, carefree attitudes and the joy of discovery. The traditional (and often religious) ties of family and community are threatened by an increasing reliance on deal making and practicality. Some families and villages long to return to the ancient traditions, but modern halflings have scant experience with them, save tales of days long past. Most halflings attempt to live a life of tradition as evidenced in these tales, but the agrarian, village-centric life only masks a deeper and more cynical pragmatism.</p>\n<h2>Xenophobia</h2>\n<p>Due to their enslavement during the Hoyrall Wars and betrayal by humanoid settlements in their lands, halflings have become very protective of each other. This protection manifests in different ways; at a very young age all halflings are taught to help one another regardless of their moral standing or ulterior motives. As they grow to maturity, however, halflings begin to realize that they have survived in part due to a darker heritage, one of suspicion and mistrust. This heritage is the one that forges secret pacts, thieves guilds, and dark deals to protect the halfling way of life and prevent outsiders from again betraying or invading their lands. Even with this dark shadow, it is taboo for one halfling to kill another even under dire circumstances—those that do face banishment.</p>\n<p>Halflings of mainland Picollo (and the Isles) do regard the @UUID[JournalEntry.QlctNkzE9injOde9.JournalEntryPage.RTYoyteEKY7EOhy2]{Dweorg}of Stonehelm as worthy allies, as well as the fey of the @UUID[.Gv1vyttllOYQaK2t#the-great-forest]{Great Forest}.

In desperate need of labor to rebuild, halfling merchants often collect the downtrodden and out-of-luck across Aventyr to ship home and bind to a seven-year term of service. Not only does this provide additional labor and hard coin for the merchant captains who ply the seas, some halflings believe a term of service will teach those of other races the value of loyalty.</p>\n<h2>Religion</h2>\n<img style=\"float:right;margin:0px 15px 15px 0px;border:0px\" src=\"modules/aaw-games-aventyr/Setting-images/Great-Mother.webp\" width=\"195\" height=\"280\" />\n<p>Worship of @UUID[JournalEntry.dOJJ8mRNTPtoihmF.JournalEntryPage.7JZLaCukpLMqn2R2]{The Mother Spirit} still pervades halfling culture and has spread to other lands by way of the many exiles residing across Aventyr. Villages are centered around the Holy Tree of of the central green where communal worship is held. The pressures and loss of the Hoyrall Wars have undermined the tenets of community espoused by the Great Mother however, and a village religious leader is as often as not to be a “@UUID[JournalEntry.dOJJ8mRNTPtoihmF.JournalEntryPage.7JZLaCukpLMqn2R2#fallen-leaf-cleric]{Fallen Leaf cleric}”, not through any evil or heretical design, but simply through an erosion of the ancient understandings.

The big island is 400 miles wide at its widest point. At the northern end of the island, the weather is temperate and the Great Mountain rises seven miles to its peak. The western side of the island sports the Great Forest, while the eastern side is made up of rolling farmlands in the interior and deepwater ports on the coast. The fractured southern tip of the island still bears the scars of the Great Schism, and overland travel is difficult in the sub-tropical climate of the south due to the number of fresh and brackish waterways permeating the broken landscape.</p><h3>The Nines</h3><p>LN large town</p><p><strong>Corruption:</strong> +0; <strong>Crime:</strong> +0; <strong>Economy:</strong> +2; <strong>Law:</strong> +1; <strong>Lore:</strong> +0; <strong>Society:</strong> +3</p><p><strong>Qualities:</strong> rumormongering citizens, strategic location, tourist attraction</p><p><strong>Danger:</strong> +5</p><p>DEMOGRAPHICS</p><p><strong>Government:</strong> council</p><p><strong>Population:</strong> 4,750 (3,500 @UUID[JournalEntry.QlctNkzE9injOde9.JournalEntryPage.myrc4omqUaiD3RKZ]{Halfling}; 30 @UUID[JournalEntry.QlctNkzE9injOde9.JournalEntryPage.RTYoyteEKY7EOhy2]{Dweorg}, 200 freedmen humans, 20 freedman other, 900@UUID[.PmrSWZmvMcJz6g4H#indentured-servitude]{ indentured} humans; 100 indentured others)</p><p><strong>Notable NPCs</strong></p><p><strong>Eseld Penberry, First Speaker</strong> (LN Female halfling aristocrat 9)</p><p><strong>Wren Machek, Freedman Councillor</strong> (NE Male human expert 8/warrior 3)</p><p><strong>@UUID[.D1IrajgFIr9gyZFw#jory-tremorgan]{Jory Tremorgan}, Historian</strong> (NG Male halfling wizard 5/expert 7)</p><p>MARKETPLACE</p><p><strong>Base Value:</strong> 2,600 gp; <strong>Purchase Limit:</strong> 10,000 gp; <strong>Spellcasting:</strong> 5th</p><p><strong>Minor Items:</strong> [[/roll 3d4]]; <strong>Medium Items:</strong> [[/roll 2d4]]; Major Items [[/roll 1d4]]</p><p>Located at the mouth of the Marigold river, the nine villages that host the @UUID[.X0uyBqIKLevC15mx#the-eldermoot]{Eldermoot}, @UUID[.X0uyBqIKLevC15mx#board-of-indentures-and-the-council-of-freedmen]{Board of Indentures}, and the@UUID[.X0uyBqIKLevC15mx#board-of-indentures-and-the-council-of-freedmen]{ Council of Freedmen} consist of a deepwater port, milling villages along the river, fishing villages up and down the coast, and farming villages, all within half a day’s travel of each other.

Situated across the river from Scrivenston, this village of some 120 souls contains some of the wealthiest freedmen in Picollo. Many owe their riches to a term of service on the Council of Freedmen (with its attendant bribes) and some retain considerable political influence. A few of the freedmen in Rivercross keep indentures of their own, and in general indentures and freedmen from other colonies across Picollo hate those who dwell within and all that Rivercross stands for: the perpetuation of the injustices of the halflings’ “peculiar institution”.</p><p></p><h2>The Isles</h2><p>The ancient archipelago once consisted of thousands of smaller islands stretching three thousand miles to the southwest. Only a handful survived the tectonic disturbances and tidal waves that accompanied the fall of the Dracoprime; the highest concentration of these islands are within 300 miles of the southern tip of the big island. The islands vary in habitability from the uninhabited desert island to tropical paradises; the warming ocean currents of the south flow east to west off the southern tip of mainland Picollo. Clans and villages of seaborn halflings are sometimes found on these islands. The most dangerous stretch of the sea is known as the Spine of the Dragon, where the vertebrae of the Dracoprime pierces the surface of the ocean, creating vicious currents and putting ships at hazard.</p><h2>The Great Mountain</h2><p>The base of the mountain is over 100 miles in diameter, surrounded by rolling hills. No other peaks compete with the seven-mile high summit; the mass that is the Great Mountain is unique. Many valleys and rises, both forested and grassy, lie sheltered on the great slopes of the mountain and alluvial rivers cascade off cliffsides, running swiftly through these vales.

The size of the entrance to the cave as well as a great underground river allows a significant amount of maritime trade to pass through the city, and the dweorg keep a harbor fleet of galleys for defense. Tunnels and avenues lead to the surface, as well as deeper into the mountain itself.</p><p>The dweorg are excellent smiths; magical arms and armor under the base price are more likely to be available in Stoneroot (85%), but staves, rings, wands, rods, and wondrous items are less likely to be available (65%). Most such items are brokered by halfling middlemen who represent zwerc mages from the cloud fortresses above, or on the black market, due to the friction between dweorg and zwerc. Scrolls and potions can be found normally.</p><p>The non-dweorg population of Stoneroot consists of halfling diplomats, merchants, and craftsmen, and their indentured servants (the dweorg do not keep indentures), as well as freedmen. Many abolitionist societies use this city as a base of operations, due to the more egalitarian government of the dwarves.</p><h2>The Great Forest</h2><p>One of the last bastions of resistance during the wars, the Great Forest suffered the least damage from the @UUID[JournalEntry.QlctNkzE9injOde9.JournalEntryPage.SGw7zGFtvjLNPDMY]{Hoyrall} invaders. Though some portions of the perimeter suffered depredation, the interior maintains its primaeval characteristics, guarded and husbanded by the fey living within. Magical and mystical creatures also share the virgin woodland; not all are friendly. In addition to the fey living in the woods, villages of tree-borer halflings can also be found, as well as the scattered humanoid settlements of runaway indentures and independently inclined freedmen.</p><p>The Great Oak of the Mother is located somewhere in the Great Forest. In ancient times, holy druids transplanted acorns from the tree to the central greens of many halfling communities. Only a few of these “Second Growth” trees survive; they are among the most powerful foci of divine magic on the island. The location of the Great Oak has been lost to time—it is rumored that its sacred grove contains a magical gate to the home sanctuary of  @UUID[JournalEntry.dOJJ8mRNTPtoihmF.JournalEntryPage.7JZLaCukpLMqn2R2]{The Mother Spirit}.</p><p></p><p></p></div>","markdown":""},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}},{"sort":800000,"name":"Significant Characters","type":"text","_id":"D1IrajgFIr9gyZFw","title":{"show":false,"level":1},"image":{},"text":{"format":1,"content":"<div class=\"aventyr\">\n<p class=\"s5\">Significant Characters</p>\n<h2>Jory Tremorgan</h2>\n<img style=\"float:right;margin:0px 15px 15px 0px;border:0px\" src=\"modules/aaw-games-aventyr/Setting-images/halfling-Crosseyes.webp\" width=\"146\" height=\"366\" />\n<p><strong>Historian</strong> (NG Male halfling wizard 5/expert 7)</p>\n<p>A member of the @UUID[.X0uyBqIKLevC15mx#board-of-indentures-and-the-council-of-freedmen]{Board of Indentures and the Council of Freedmen}, Tremorgan is almost convinced that the halfling’s “peculiar institution” is leading them away from their heritage.
